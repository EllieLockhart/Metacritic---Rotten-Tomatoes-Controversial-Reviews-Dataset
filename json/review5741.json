{"101487":115744,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Director and writer\\, Rian Johnson\\, made one of the strongest installments within the legendary 40 year old saga of Star Wars. This film is the one silver lining of the Sequel Trilogy\\, this is the only Sequel Trilogy movie that deserves a fresh tomatomer. For its boldness\\, depth and thematical continuity with the George Lucas movies and later animation. The Last Jedi isn't afraid to get complex\\, and in fact can be read in multiple ways.\\n\\nTitled \\\"8: The Last Jedi\\\" it is clear the word \\\"Jedi\\\" in the title is there for a very poignant reason\\, to tell us this is the one true-sequel to  \\\"6: Return of the Jedi\\\". Despite being a direct-sequel to \\\"7: The Force Awakens\\\"\\, this movie clearly disavowes a lot of it\\, in order to get back to Lucas' Star Wars basics\\, all backlash is unjustified. Many people where taken aback by the \\\"sudden change in tone\\\". But the 8 movie is inocent of such crime\\, it is a return to form\\, a return to what Lucas established on 6 (which was entirely absent from 7.\\n\\nIt is hard to explain\\, but the movie that departed from the tone of the previous Star Wars entries by George Lucas\\, was in fact\\, the predecessor movie \\\"7: The Force Awakens\\\"\\, and it's writer and director JJ Abrams is to blame for that\\, George Lucas himself openly expressed his dissatisfaction with JJ Abrams work\\, similarly to howas Star Trek 2: Wrath of Khan director in regards to JJ Abrams' Star Trek remake films\\,. Both\\, Lucas and Meyer complained about JJ Abrams for similar reasons\\, the man lazily did remakes of their movies\\, instead of advancing the story on any meaningful manner. JJ Abrams previous films offered unncecesary in-your-face dejavu shot-per-shot remake callbacks\\, directly plagiarized from the original 1977 film\\, rip-off after rip-off. Every single scene or line from the previous film but now a younger character says it (George Lucas and the rival franchise director of Star Trek II complained rightfully about JJ Abrams remaking  without bringing anthing new to the table). \\n\\nBy the time Force Awakens gets to the new original storyline it f-word ends in the middle of it's sole Original Scene (worst of all it cornered Rian Johnson into a remake of V: Empire Strikes Back with Rey in Dagobah (with another name\\, and a Resistance likely on the run).\\n\\nRian Jhonsson's The Last Jedi knows that JJ Abrams' setup is terrible\\, that he dumbed down the plot of the franchises in order to appeal to casuals. So it rightfully rejects the lazy-JJ Abrams-remake-formula. Even if JJ Abrams poor choices at how he ended 7\\, already had cornered The Last Jedi on a premise similar to the one of 5: The Empire Strikes Back\\, going as far forcing possible remake scenes from 5. All scenes that are similar to Empire are JJ Abrams setup blame. Thankfully\\, Jhonson is aware people didn't wanted another mediocre-remake. So even if visually echo; the original it gives the cyclical storytelling a different\\, this cynical self-awareness  7 lacked. 8 is embarrassed and continously apologizong about it. It gives each callback a new meaning\\, (Unlike JJ Abrams\\, were they attempted to have the same previous meaning\\, but you can't repricate that\\, so it had none. They were always remade wrong\\, because the character choices weren't about what was right for the characters or the plot\\, but rather thinking what would be the most similar to the 1977 Original film? Or in characters minds\\, what would Luke do? They are barely allowed to be their own persons\\, it goes back to questioning the sins of the fathers\\, and figuring out how to not repeat them. The main theme of Star Wars).\\n\\nWhat were clones of the original characters in JJ Abrams work\\, finally become original characters with fleshed out motivations here. Making Rey's father special would have been boring\\, Snoke living would have turned him into Palpatine 2\\, the Jedi mind trick duel of Luke is the most original since the Twin Suns' Rebels episode with Obi-wan and Maul. Both superior to JJ Abrams sole duel \\, I might add\\, and yes the duel were Rey and Kylo Ren team-up was also visually great and a twist onto itself. I can't praise the film enough for deconstructing the expected twist always in favor of the least expected.\\n\\nLuke Skywalker's exile and disappointment with the Jedi religion totally and respectfully mirrors Star Wars's creator George Lucas divorce from Star Wars. Even the betrayal by a pupil obsessed with remaking a past he doesn't even understand\\, JJ Abrams and Kylo Ren's remake failure\\, are one and the same\\, both got corrupted by Snoke\\, I mean Disney.\\n\\nLuke like Lucas is a dissilusioned pope. knowing his religion's history is full of failure (the Prequel to a degree)\\, sins\\, and ignorance. It got corrupted from the inside without even realizing. The old creed is dated stagnant (a clear criticism to the Catholic Church and all religions\\, but also to politically incorrect Prequels). Is exactly what the prequels and 6: Return if the Jedi hinted. Said 6\\, ends with Luke throwing his saber\\, it makes sense to reintroduce Luke\\, throwing his saber away\\, for the same reason he did in 6\\, to save a life. \\n\\nThis film is the anti-JJ Abrams for all of us\\, who were heavilly dissapointed with The Force Awakens lack of originallity. Such a shame that JJ Abrams' remake-sequel \\\"IX: Rise of Skywalker- Return of the Jedi remake\\\" reverted all \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" right choices in favor of what I previously described as predictably boring JJ Abrams remake choices\\, basically reverted the only original choices in the whole Sequel Trilogy. And\\, instead of taking her own choices\\, Rey reverts to always trying to behave like Luke. And thinking that Luke is always right\\, without any thinking about the action themselves.","true":true}
