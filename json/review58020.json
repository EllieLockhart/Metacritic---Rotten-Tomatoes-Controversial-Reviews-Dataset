Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the movie might be interesting for the average movie goer\\, someone who has personal interest in the Star Wars universe or is craving a strong storyline and background will be sorely disappointed. The movie is too long for the meat of the material\\, I got a real filler-episode vibe from watching it. While the burping jokes and 4th wall gags were undoubtedly crowd pleasers\\, I felt like it was really out of place for a Star Wars film. There's just too much negative to say about this movie so I'll digress. I thought Mark Hamill did well for what he had to work with\\, Carrie Fisher also was okay in her role - although her plot line and dialog was insulting to frankly most people's intelligence I think. The new cast members all did fine with the exception of John Boyega who they really need to do something with\\, his character is so one dimensional and unrelatable I don't think anyone in the role could make it work. Overall\\, this is just another great opportunity for Disney to sink their claws into this marketing cash cow franchise and continue to reach broad categories of demographics to sell their wares. 1.5 stars on the merit of the actors\\, excellent music\\, beautiful effects both practical and otherwise.","true":true}
