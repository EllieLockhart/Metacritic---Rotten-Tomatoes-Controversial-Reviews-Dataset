Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yes there were some plot holes in the movie and I would have liked to have learned a little more about some of the more important characters\\, but overall I really liked the movie and I think it stayed true to the feel of the Star Wars universe...","true":true}
