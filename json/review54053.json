Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I created an account just to review this movie here. I am a fan of Star Wars\\, and of movies in general. I see everything and have for the past 25 years. I feel on this movie the critics did the audience a huge disservice\\, This movie was terrible. Did it have some entertaining sequences? Sure. But it was like Rian Johnson wanted to go a completely different direction than what was set up for this in TFA. I thought JJ Abrams\\, despite a lot of copying from the OT\\, set up the new trilogy with some compelling storylines and characters. It's almost as if Rian Johnson was not happy being boxed in by any of it and just threw most of it in the garbage. To be clear\\, and because a lot of the other criticism of this film relates to this\\, I have no problem with any social points being made in films\\, I have no problem with the diversity of the cast (I think that's great)\\, and having lots of strong women characters (I think that's fantastic as well). My criticism is with the terrible story\\, spending way too much time on a subplot that amounts to nothing in the end\\, introducing additional characters that add nothing to the plot\\, and being inconsistent with the Star Wars universe as a whole\\, and the hooks we the audience were left with at the end of TFA. Additionally\\, while the visuals were amazing at times\\, it did not FEEL like a Star Wars movie. Bad jokes in very odd places seemed like an intentional slap in the face to longtime fans. The cutting between the various subplots seemed forced. And at to that\\, there were very few wipe transitions. While I wasn't counting\\, it seemed very clear that a decision was made to not use many wipe transitions. The wipe transitions really define the visual style in all the Star Wars films. I understand that they didn't use any in Rogue One\\, and at the time I thought it was an intentional stylistic decision to make it appear separate from the man saga (along with the non-Williams Score). Anyhow\\, I saw the movie twice\\, and on second viewing most of my criticisms of this movie were confirmed....at first I thought perhaps I was missing something. I have zero desire to watch Episode IX\\, this movie has ruined Star Wars for me. They have ruined Luke Skywalker\\, I can see why Mark Hamill was so adamantly opposed to this portrayal. I feel sorry for him\\, but to his credit he still committed and gave it his best and I thought his performance was fantastic.","true":true}
