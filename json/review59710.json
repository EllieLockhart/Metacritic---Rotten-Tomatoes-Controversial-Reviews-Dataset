I do NOT agree with what many people say about the title. Just because many did not even understand what the developers were trying to say with the story in the first game does not mean that the continuation of the story of the TLOU2 is now \\\"stupid\\\" or \\\"wrong\\\" ;)\r\rThis game has and shows SO MUCH inhumane violence and savagery ... I AM APPALLED BY IT WITH EVERY FACET!!! So: #IamWithPolygon\r\rI do not agree with the developers that this much violence and true savagery was really necessary to tell the story they wanted to tell\\, here. I think the message of ...\r\\\"Violence breeds more violence ... and even if it doesn't: It is bad in every way\\\"\r... is something every human knows in his\/her heart. It is something that does not need to be explained because you can feel it. Let alone to the extent that is shown in TLOU2! Even in warzones - THE ONLY PLACE where such things even would happen - people are simply wishing this would stop and stop for good. What Naughty Dog depicts here - IS WAR - FCOL!\r\rI urge you to not buy the game. Instead what you should do is watch a \\\"cutscene-compilation\\\" of the game on YouTube. This will show you the full story. Of course this will spoil the whole game. But then you can decide for yourself beforhand if you really want to get drawn into this \\\"INHUMANE PIT OF HELL\\\" which Naughty Dog has created here. Which you probably will not ;)\r\rConclusion:\r\rArtists of any kind ...\r\\\"You do not need to drag a living thing before your audience and beat it to death in the most abhorrent and violent manner to get across the message that violence is bad.\rHUMANS ARE NOT THAT STUPID!\rWE ARE NO MONKEYS ANYMORE!\r... YOU KNOW ;)\\\"\r\rFootnote 1:\rTechnicaly this \\\"product\\\" is a masterpiece. WOW!\rBut it is not something which you can \\\"play\\\". Because it is not playful.\rSo\\, technically ... I cannot call this a \\\"game\\\". -Sorry Naughty Dog!\r\rFootnote 2:\rThis story could have been very well used for a book. Mind you this story would not have been for everyone. And very likey many readers would have been appalled by the story and the crude message eitherway\\, but at least it would have been better digestible in that form.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
