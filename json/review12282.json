Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am not sure why a lot of people are butthurt over this film. You go to a movie to be entertained\\, not to decipher the red sea scrolls. This movie is entertaining and yes there are some meh moments but this movie does not deserve a 1 or a 2 rating. Enjoy the movie and don\u2019t go in expecting an Oscar worth film.","true":true}
