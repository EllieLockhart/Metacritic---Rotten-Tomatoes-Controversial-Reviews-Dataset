Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It\u0092s all there again\\, conflicting feelings\\, bad guy might have some good in him\\, race to destroy big weapon before it kills the good guys (twice) reluctant Jedi master trains over confident student\\, blah\\, blah\\, blah. Surely they could come up with a new twist\\, sorry Star Wars fans this franchise is over.","true":true}
