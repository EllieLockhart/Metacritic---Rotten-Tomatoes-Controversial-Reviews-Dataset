{"101487":108677,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Belongs on the dung heap like episode 7. Completely without quality. Our 3 classical heroe have now all died lousy pointless deaths becos disney refuses to pay them their due. But of course all this rubbish will go on and on becos idiots continue to watch this crap. Kathleen kennedy's vomit. The last true star wars movie was rouge one.","true":true}
