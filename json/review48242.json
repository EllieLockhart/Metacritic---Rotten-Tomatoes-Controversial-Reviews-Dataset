Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Why are the critics so dishonest to rate Justice League a 41% and SWTLJ a 92%. Justice League is not that bad to be 41% at worst it is an 80%. And SWTLJ\\, don't get me started with TLJ. Can't the critics see the plot holes?Are all the thousand of fans complaints unwarranted. The critics call us \\\"cry babies\\\". WTF\\, critics are suppose to criticize\\, why so fracking lazy. That surprising twist  that the critics love so much is insulting to the fans. Can't the critics see that. Critics\\, Stop telling fans what to think and feel because you don't know shit. Lastly\\, why keep suggesting to people to watch the movie again. Why the hell will I watch a crappy movie again? Except maybe to make Disney rich. Is that what it is all about. Is this how it all comes down to\\, having Lazy critics or paid critics? It is so very suspicious. and there could only be one explanation. that is\\, the critics are dishonest and Disney is the puppet master.","true":true}
