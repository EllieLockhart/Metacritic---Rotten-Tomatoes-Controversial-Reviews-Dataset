Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a poor show from Disney. This film single handedly destroys everything that was built in the force awakens and adds ridiculous force powers that Disney seem to think you can just make up on the spot. Will the jedis be flying in the next film and have 10 arms? \\n\\nGood points-\\n-Mark Hamills acting is top notch\\n-Some of the shots and angles are visually pleasing\\n-Oscar Issacs character is played well\\n\\nBad points-\\n-Terrible direction for Luke Skywalkers character\\n-Further character development was weak\\n-breaks all the rules and laws of Star Wars\\n-Rose was a plain and boring character with a terrible story line\\n-Disney's jokes were just an insult to Star Wars including 'your mum' jokes... really? In Star Wars?\\n- Reys parents? No comment","true":true}
