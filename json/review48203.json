Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Whiny little fanboys bitcbed that TFA was a rip-off of Episode IV...now they complain that TLJ does not feel like a Star Wars movie.  Keyboard tough-guys just like hating on everything.","true":true}
