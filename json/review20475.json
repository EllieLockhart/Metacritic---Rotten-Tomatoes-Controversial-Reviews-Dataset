Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a Star Wars fan forever and I have re-watched the original trilogy 100 x over. I really enjoyed The Last Jedi\\, it was definitely something different and a complete shake up of the Star Wars mythology. But I loved it! Walked out of the cinemas inspired with a big smile on my face!","true":true}
