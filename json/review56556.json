Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi\\, in all honesty and without the slightest trace of irony\\, is a foetid turd of a film. It is not just the lowest point in the Star Wars canon of movies\\, but a sad and tawdry episode in cinematic history. I would even go so far as to say that marks a nadir in western civilisation. It was clearly made by people who have no love or respect for the Star Wars universe\\, it's place in western society as an important and beloved cultural phenomena or the millions upon millions of fans from across the globe who made it what it is. The minds of Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson seem to have been warped by the same end-stage marxist critical theory that pollutes our universities\\, colleges and much of our press these days. There is no story\\, no plot\\, no pace\\, no character development\\, no sense of wonder or joy\\, just a truly bizarre collection of barely connected tableau\\, one moment virtue signalling\\, one moment man-shaming\\, the next setting up some utterly dismal gag or worse still\\, casually destroying any trope or plot-point that could actually bring some meaning to this utter abortion. In fact\\, the only coherent thread I could identify in this film was the character assassination of Luke Skywalker\\, That's in essence what these films are now\\, they exist to destroy the mythos of the original trilogy\\, to ruin the characters that star wars fans once held dear and give a huge middle finger to older fans.  It reminds me of kids I knew when I was young and out playing Star Wars with my friends\\, there was always some little shit who couldn't just join in with everyone else and had to ruin it because he came to the party late and someone else was already Han or Luke. Rian Johnson is that spoilt kid\\, and this film is the paddy he never got to throw as a child. One star for the visual effects.","true":true}
