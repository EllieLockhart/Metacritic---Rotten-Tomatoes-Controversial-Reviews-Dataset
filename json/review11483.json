Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible movie.  Plot didn't make any sense\\, dialog was lacking\\, no explanation of anything.  How and why did Disney release this as is?  And now the director is getting 3 more movies?  No thank you.  This movie is the reason we will not pay to see these movies in the theater anymore.","true":true}
