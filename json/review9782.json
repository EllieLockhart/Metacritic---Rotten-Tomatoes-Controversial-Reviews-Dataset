Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Gotta be honest\\, I felt like the entire goal of this movie was to constantly set up expectations\\, then twist and undermine them for the sole purpose of keeping the audience uncomfortable. Like the director wanted this to not feel like a Star Wars film. In that\\, he was successful. The hope\\, the action\\, the character dynamics- it was all missing. A good movie\\, I suppose\\, but not a Star Wars movie. ","true":true}
