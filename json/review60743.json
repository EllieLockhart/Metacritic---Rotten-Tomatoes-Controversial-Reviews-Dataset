First of all this game gets a bonus point in my rating\\, just because it was treated very unfair by a huge amount of people\\, some of them got sad because someone they liked died. (Spoiler free) Thats not a valid critic if you look at this game from an at least a bit objective view\r\rGraphics and Sound (10\/10)\r\rTLOU2 is one of the most beautiful Games I have ever played. The graphics were really detailed\\, with realistic characters\\, detailed hair and what I loved the most\\, was how they recreated Seattle. The sounds were amazing as well. Everytime Ellie had to jump a long distance\\, you really heard how exhausted she was\\, every destroyed window sounded like the window we sat next to was just shattered in the moment\\, the window in the game did. Those are just a few examples.\r\rGameplay (9\/10)\r\rTLOU2 excels over TLOU due to improvements in the Gameplay. Fighting and shooting got clearly improved\\, making every fight fun\\, the dodging mechanic allowed you to just beat up runners in close combat more easily and to dodge new\\, bigger enemies. New hiding mechanics like crouching in tall grass\\, impoved the gameplay for me personally as well. For me looting was an essential and fun part of the gameplay\\, but I get\\, why some people dont like it. Well its a survival horror and you dont have to loot everything if you dont want to. 9\/10 because of a few bugs I saw.\r\rAtmosphere (10\/10)\r\rIts a suvival horror game\\, that always made you feel anxious in a lot of situations and got you emotionally carried away a lot of times. I had moments were I was really scared\\, some were I was really angry at characters and some were I was sad and had to cry some tears.\r\rStory (9\/10)\r\rFor me the story of TLOU2 was great. At the moment a character we all loved died\\, I was really angry at the antagonist and wanted to kill this person and everyone of them so badly. Progressing through the story with everything that happened you saw how Ellie was destroyed by all that hate in her. She turned into a violent person\\, killing everyone in her way to the Goal\\, just like Joel. I loved that decision. And the moment you played as the antagonist you felt a bond with her as well\\, making the end game emotionally really hard to play. If you get carried avay with your emotions like this\\, the game mus be great\u2026 Expand","true":true}
