Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney has done to Star Wars what Anakin did to the Jedi temple at the end of episode 3 - burned it to the ground.\\n\\nWhat was once a vast universe of diverse characters\\, races\\, species\\, technology\\, stories and relationships has become so very soulless\\, even passionless.  Star Wars: The Last Jedi is\\, at the very least\\, accurate in name only - the Star Wars universe without it's most meaningful protagonists.  And it doesn't appear they will be coming back ever again.\\n\\nFor any true Star Wars fans\\, this film will break your heart.","true":true}
