Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"soooo\\, this movie was boring and never reached a definitive climax that satisfy you\\, like ... you wait the entire movie to finaly get to this EPIC climax\\, or some awesome lore\\, backrounds\\, anything for that matter\\,   maybe a schocking twist\\, ANYTHING  and it just never gets there\\,  it feels like you need to replace anything that happens after the well\\,\\,\\, 2 act.  the third act was so tackt on to me\\,  i dont rly know what to think of this\\,  the sub\u00fclots were boring\\,  characters are misstreated all movie long\\, luke is a dick\\, and an idiot in this movie\\,  sometimes i thought there is some BIG reveal or something\\, but i saw the most obvious solution for his backround and well it happened\\,    kylo and rey are just a mess\\,  i mean it starts fine\\, it all starts fine okay\\, but during the middle it just goes to this\\, well GOOD TO THE END cliche\\, and man why. good cant always fking win\\, but somehow it does... like COMON  and man dont get me started on the leia thing\\, man wtf\\, i had at least 3 fking timeds when i thought she will now die\\, and its gonna be sad n shit\\, and it chickened out ever time.   every godforsaken time\\,  just wtf\\nbtw i watched this movie with my brother\\,  and he fell asleep\\,  HE FKING SLEPT  because the movie is boring and drags without payoff\\,","true":true}
