Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lets see\\, I don't like Poe\\, I don't like Holdo\\, lost my love for Fin\\, am baffled at how Rey is such a powerful force user. Adam driver is excellent but his character is still underwhelming. I gave her a chance but I HATE Rose.\\n\\nI enjoyed the movie for the most part but it had some awful moments and in the end it does a poor job of storytelling. Both TFA and TLJ suffer from poor character development and almost no explanation as to how we've gotten from RotJ to where we are now. \\n\\nThe movie would have been much better had they cut out Rose\\, added in Snoke and Phasma backstory and focused more on Luke and Rey. \\n\\nSeems like this movie really does want to kill the past yet it has failed to deliver much of anything worth killing it for.\\n\\nTo date Rogue One has been the best Star Wars movie ever made since the original. Maybe get that team to make some more good Star Wars movies.","true":true}
