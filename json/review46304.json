Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was disappointed. How will the jedi survive if there is no jedi to lead them?\\nand the resistance is bs\\, and they did not explain anything about the new republic\\, just destroyed it in the last movie. I love all star wars movies\\, ( including rouge one\\,) But i Hated the last 2. What a joke","true":true}
