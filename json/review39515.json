Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film tried really hard to be a service to the fans as well as be refreshing and stand by itself. In my opinion it does this brilliantly and is able to flow between each scene easily and does not tear you out of the movie for one second. Not saying that there are not faults with this movie\\, which with all movies none are perfect. But the last Jedi brings home of what a solid film is meant to be and that's why it deserves to have such a good rating","true":true}
