Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointed by the posted score by the audience. Perfect movie\\, no... but a great roller coaster of a ride! This is not the Star Wars we grew up with\\, perhaps... but let's remember Ep IV was not well received originally\\, plenty of hokey stuff going on there as well. Embrace the future\\, give up the past... Riam Johnson is taking us somewhere here and it's logical. Absolutely gorgeous film","true":true}
