Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good movie overall but could have been much better! Smoke was a waste\\, shops don't have force fields anymore? Oh yeah\\, what the fuck is up with leia?! Disney couldn't give a crap about Star Wars lore or any of its die hard fans. They just care about money and all of the unknowing fanboys who haven't hit puberty yet.","true":true}
