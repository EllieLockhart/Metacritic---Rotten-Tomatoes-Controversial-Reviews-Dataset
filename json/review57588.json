Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very well done. Beautiful scenes\\, great character design\\, great score and wonderful performances. The big issue... in my opinion\\, most of the plotlines had no satisfying climax. Some of the questions that arose in the force awakens were never answered. And the ones that were felt as if their answer was created SOLELY to throw the audience off. Not a satisfying movie. the list goes on for me really\\, but I've ranted enough \ud83d\ude01 Just go into knowing that'll it'll be done Disney's new way of doing these (throwing you on a rollercoaster of surprises just to thoroughly shock you. No matter how ridiculous the plot gas to dive to do so). This is all my opinion so make sure you still check it out! ","true":true}
