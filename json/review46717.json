Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"We didn't get anywhere in this movie. The acting was good\\, the action was good\\, the story itself was good. The problem comes down to this didn't advance anything in the overall story. It reminds me of those TV episodes that are just thrown in mid season that have no impact on the overarching story. They are just throw away episodes. \\n\\nSPOILERS : \\nSo the rebels\/resistance are running from the First Order again. There is no Luke again. Snoke is dead\\, but honestly we didn't know anything about him so who cares. Kylo is still a rage monster. The Weasly guy is still a dork. Phasma might be dead? Rey got even less training that Luke did from Yoda\\, basically none at all. \\n\\nI love all the Star Wars movies\\, but this one out of all of them might be in last place.\\n\\nThe people making these movies is missing something very important. People get into these characters\\, when you have a movie that just just basically a popcorn flick and doesn't advance character development you missed the point. That's why you see such high Critic reviews and lower user reviews. Critics are looking at it from a single movie\\, where as us normal movie goers are looking at this in the context of the whole series. \\n\\nI'll make a plea that may fall on deaf ears\\, but please get someone to write the final movie that understands these points.","true":true}
