Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing in so many ways.  It fails as a story.  It fails as a Star Wars movie.  It fails as a Science Fiction movie.  It fails it's fan base.  It fails to entertain.  I watched this movie opening night and left with a great sense of disappointment.  I went and watched it a second time just to be sure I wasn't missing somerhing. After the second viewing I went from disappointment to disgust.  It is as if they gored a director\/writer that hated Star Wars and and somehow conned his way into the franchise to destroy it from within.  I will see the next instalment\\, Solo\\, but if they let me down there\\, I will resist seeing the final movie as a form of protest against Disney.  Is Disney now the metaphorical Empire\/First Order.  Do we need to form a rebellion?","true":true}
