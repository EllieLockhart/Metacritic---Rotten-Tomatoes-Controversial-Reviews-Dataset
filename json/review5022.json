Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Crapped all over the story lines and characters of The Force Awakens. Like the new director intentionally wanted to show JJ how much he thought his ideas sucked\\, so he just goes and and undoes all the story lines and questions people wanted answered. Went to see where the story was going\\, instead got no real answers and left not looking forward to any story line in the next movie. I don't think there's really a single thing I'm looking forward to. I was left not thinking about how the next movie will answer a question or how it all gets tied together\\, nope instead I left just thinking...... hmmm so that was it... ok. Wanted to like it\\, tried to convince myself I liked it but unfortunately it was lucky to even get 2 stars\\, and impossible to get excited about telling others to see it.","true":true}
