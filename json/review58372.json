Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After an hour of watching nothing\\, the film finally started with killing off Snoke and Phasma and giving a few fuck you audience moments along with it. Finn went off with some annoyance named Rose\\, who no one really cares about and in the end what they go off to do is completely pointless so it's a shame Finn got wasted. The only redeeming factor is watching Rey struggle with Luke and Kylo Ren which is genuinely interesting. However\\, this was wasted by constantly jump-cutting to Finn and the resistance where barely anything was happening and what was happening was hideously boring. There was no big battle of The First Order vs The Resistance as the resistance ran away at every opportunity\\, likewise\\, there was no true Lightsaber battle either and with 2 and a half hours worth of Star Wars to have no battle is extremely disappointing. \\n\\nOverall the film wasn't terrible but it was dragged out and didn't have the Star Wars vibe that made the original trilogy and The Force Awakens great.","true":true}
