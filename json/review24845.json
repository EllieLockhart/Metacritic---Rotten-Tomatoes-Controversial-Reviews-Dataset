Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My enjoyment of the movie was nearly ruined by the online scuttlebutt (despite trying to avoid it).  I have followed Star Wars since the original (which i reviewed for a major metropolitan newspaper).  \\nThere are some challenging concepts in Last Jedi but it was more faithful to the original trilogy ethos than the prequel trilogy.  It is essentially a mirror of Empire Strikes Back (which I recall also upsetting a number of Star Wars fans) and should hopefully set up a Return of the Jedi-type denouement.\\nMost complaints I've seen reflect viewers not having their preconceptions justified.\\nThese movies\\, after all\\, are space opera - not 2001\\, A Space Odyssey.\\nMy wife - who is a film buff\\, not a Star Wars aficionado - loved it as a movie.","true":true}
