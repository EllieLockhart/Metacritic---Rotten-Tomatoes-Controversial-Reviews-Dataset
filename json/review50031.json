Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Zero stars\\, a disgrace to the rest of the film well kinda. It doesn't seem that anyone can stick to the same story or learn from the success of the original movies. This movie was a long and boring film that was basically a \\\"B\\\" movie just using the Star Wars brand. The movie has killed off all character development of any new character the film attempted to bring all while killing off almost all of the characters from the previous films and the Star Wars universe. I'm not even sure where the movie goes from here . I'm finished watching these movies because at this point it's just fraud of the highest order similar to haloeeen 3 the season of the witch. A movie that used the Halloween title and did not even have the iconic Michael Myers in the film.","true":true}
