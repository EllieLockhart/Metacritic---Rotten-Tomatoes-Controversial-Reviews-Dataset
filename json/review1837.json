Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A series of massive plot holes and incoherence strung together with meaningless action\\, character humiliation and failure. \\n\\nAn anti-Star Wars movie written by someone who apparently doesn't care\\, or actively dislikes\\, the narrative essence of the story. \\n\\nAnd let me tell you - I really wanted to like this movie - I like liking things - but this was so bad it was painful to watch.","true":true}
