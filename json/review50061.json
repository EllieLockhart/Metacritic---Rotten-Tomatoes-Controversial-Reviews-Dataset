Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cheap storytelling with a complete disregard for structure\\, disguised as a Star Wars movie.\\n\\nIts pretty clear that Johnson took the hipster path and decided to do the exact opposite of expectations just for cheap effect. \\\"I'm a contrarian\\, who cares about story structure\\, story telling\\, the saga structure\\, I'm just going to toss it all out the window to be different!\\\"\\n\\nIts like he was trying to be GRR Martin\\, but lacked the knowledge of what was important and what was not. Martin never subverted expectations that would affect the end game nor the structure.  Johnson went in with a sledgehammer and completely disregarded all the story Abrams set up\\, not to mention the structure of the entire saga\\, for cheap effect.\\n\\nEach trilogy is the hero's journey of a Skywalker - Lucas used Campbell's model (in fact most famous stories are the same model) so for story consistency then this one must also be the hero's journey of a Skywalker. This is not Ben Solo's hero's journey - he is a different archetype. He is not on a hero's journey\\, Rey is on the hero's journey. \\n\\nYet\\, Johnson\\, in his hubris\\, decides to just \\\"screw all that\\\"\\, now this is no longer the hero's  journey of a Skywalker\\, it's the hero's journey of a \\\"nobody\\\" stuffed into the Skywalker saga\\, because it's \\\"daring\\\" \\\"cutting edge\\\". 2\/3 of the way through\\, its now a trilogy about  - well\\, I don't know what\\, because Johnson was so busy trying to flip a bird to fan theories  that he completely forgot to write an actual story. It is 100% subverting expectations\\, just for the f**k of it. \\n\\nThis is just immature storytelling. \\n\\nSeries are series for a reason\\, and when you decide that you can just disregard what the series is about in some lame attempt to be \\\"different\\\"\\, then that is a problem. Next season of Supernatural\\, why do we need Winchesters? Wouldn't it be DARING storytelling to instead focus on someone besides a Winchester? Hey! Lets have a Game of Thrones won by someone completely new! \\n\\nIt isn't \\\"cutting edge\\\" to center an existing series on a someone with no narrative connection to the rest of the story\\, it's bad storytelling. And yet - critics who should know better and legions of millennials who never went to creative writing class don't see the problem here. They exhibit Dunning-Kruger where they honestly lack the insight into storytelling to see the problem. \\n\\nAnd that's only PART of the problem with this movie. \\n\\nLuke: trashed as a character\\, misused\\, wasted and and killed off just because no one was expecting it.\\n\\nLeia: kept alive despite a great opportunity to send her off\\, just because no one was expecting it. \\n\\nSnokes: Killed off just because no one was expecting it\\n\\nSee a theme here? \\n\\nWeird sub plots that made no sense and served no purpose. \\n\\nAnd the great confrontation between Kylo and Rey was completely meta. We the fans think her parents are special  (because shes the central character in the Skywalker Saga) but Rey doesn't have this knowledge.  Yet the dialogue here focuses on how her parents are \\\"nobody\\\" as a statement to the audience. When exactly did Rey ever think they were \\\"somebody\\\"? \\n\\nIt's clear that Johnson was not writing for good narrative nor for good storytelling\\, but just as a response to fans. In the age of social media\\, this is a dangerous precedent. What becomes the story should not be influenced by fans\\, and should not be influenced by a desire to flip a finger to them. Writers need to do whats best for the story\\, not their egos.","true":true}
