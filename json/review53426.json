Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it. Some parts of the  that were cheesy (Leia scene) but 95 percent of the movie was good. Different than the other Star Wars but still similar enough to be Star Wars. Don't listen to the jaded fans. Go in with open mind and don't pay attention to fan theories etc before seeing it. REAL fans of Star Wars will like it\\, not just people who only like Empire Strikes Back. You can't call yourself a fan if you say only 2-3 of the 9 movies are good.","true":true}
