Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly I expected so much more but rehashing tired old space fight scene's is getting pretty old. Fresh writing is desperately needed here. Some good scenes but not enough to earn my respect. case in point: When the unarmed ships are escaping the entrusted last\/only crewman the Captain if you will watches her people getting blown to bits ship after ship after ship before it finally dawns on her to attack at warp speed as a ram collission tactic to save the fleeing ships. Really??? It took her that long to think of attacking as a ram\/kill ship...watching her people get blown away...over and over again... Honestly horrible writing is revealed consistently throughout bthe film. Oh I cannot get the scene of a Space frozen Dead commander Leia turning into Super Leia and flying like Supeman in Space...A total laugher scene.. pathetic ..so many disjointed incoherent scenes I was pretty disgusted.. anyhoo hopefully stuff like that gets scrapped and can be corrected in the next film...(I hope). But maybe btime to catch it on cable if this happens again..or Redbox :(","true":true}
