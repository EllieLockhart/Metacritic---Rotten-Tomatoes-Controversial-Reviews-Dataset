Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love the Star Wars franchise for nostalgic reasons. I was a bit disgruntled by the Force Awakens as the characters did not have the depth I would usually.expect. Nevertheless I went to see The Last Jedi with my son and husband\\, all fans. Horrible\\, horrible horrible! I heard my son start muttering about Luke being \\\"lame\\\" and weak very early on. Bearing in mind he does not have the massive Luke nostalgia that I do I was shocked.  Honestly I was bored and came away utterly disappointed. Kylo Ren is such a weak villain\\, if I want to watch a teen tantrum I can do that when I teach! Rey has no vulnerabilities. Big fat SIGH!","true":true}
