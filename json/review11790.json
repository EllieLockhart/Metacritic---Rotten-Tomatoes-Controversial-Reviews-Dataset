Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How is it possible to decimate the greatest franchise in movie history?  Yes\\, the plot sucked...yes\\, the character development was non-existent...and yes\\, THE Jedi Master milks a space cow.  But...how on earth did the script get signed off?  At times\\, it felt like I was watching an episode of Sex in the City.  The Lost Jedi is the most disappointing movie I have ever experienced.  A complete disaster\\, and ultimately...very sad.","true":true}
