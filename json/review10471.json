Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great sequel. Enjoyed every minute of it. Was every plot decision an absolute winner? No\\, but nothing was going to make all fans happy. I can accept what happened and move with it. Apparently\\, some cannot.","true":true}
