Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Twists and Turns for the very sake of twists and turns. Don't tell me Jhonson is creative or innovative. There's not any new idea in this movie (bedise the force-skype conversation). But the total lack of them hidden by twists and turns. In the end it's always the same story. But told via mind tricks. As a stand alone\\, one may ever find it entertaining. I didn't. But... De gustibus non disputandum est. In the context of a trilogy it's a total waste of time.","true":true}
