Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't understand how Rian Johnson was able to make such an awful movie with all of the resources he has available. This is easily the worst Star Wars movie to date. There were so many missed opportunities and Leia flyuing through space?!? Luke Skywalker is one of the most beloved heroes in all of science fiction. His presence in this movie is barely noticeable. Snoke\\, who was billed as the most diabolical villain in the whole series\\, is dispatched without lifting a finger...literally! What a waste! What a mess! What a disappointment! Rian Johnson is to Star Wars what Zach Snyder is to the DC universe\\, the destroyer of worlds! Sooo many exclamation points\\, I feel like I'm in an episode of Seinfeld. ","true":true}
