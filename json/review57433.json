Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was bad. Like REALLY bad.  I walked out of the theater after the movie and wasnt sure how i felt about it. On further thinking. Its beyond bad.  Its message was nothing you love about star wars matters. All the interesting things dont matter. Who cares about the characters. Or character development?   It was the movie speed in space. My biggest plot hole that i just cant get past is that. Finn and rose get off the ship. If they could do that. Why the fuck couldnt they all pack in the ship. Like take out all the shit and just shove themselves in and escape. If they couldnt track their ship why the heck wouldnt they use it. Like they could take multiple trips.   Plus if a vehicle is faster than another they would eventually escape. Or why wouldnt they just launch every fighter. The first order has always been afraid of killing their own people. Like the empire threw everyone away. But god forbid kylo ren hurt someone. I just i cant even. History will not look kind on this movie or the director\/writer.","true":true}
