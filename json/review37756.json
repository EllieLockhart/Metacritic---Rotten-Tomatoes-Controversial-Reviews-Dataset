Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There was so much potential already laid down in the force awakens\\, and its mindboggling how much of it abused by adding characters (that are all killed off by the end of the movie) and inserting plot sequences that are made for crudely executed social statements. other less horrible sins in the movie include chewbacca demeaned to the role of an uber driver with no real influence to decisions or friendships with old pals\\, the way the antagonists of the first order\\, including big baddy snoke\\, are reduced to bumbling idiots\\, or the insistence that kylo - a murderer that commited *patricide* and *killed off han solo* - deserves redemption. meanwhile luke is undercut as a grumpy old man that doesn't understand his own disillusioned philosophy about the force - no\\, just because you want to individually give up the force to end the struggle of light and dark\\, doesn't mean the entire galaxy or universe will get the memo that your tired of everything and will just go \\\"ok we will stawp this light side and dark side business\\\"\\, if you wanna get metaphysical about the force\\, don't just dip your finger in the water then back off because your franchise is meant to sell toys.","true":true}
