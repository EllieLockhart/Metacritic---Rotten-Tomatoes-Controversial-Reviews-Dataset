Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Different from any Star Wars i have yet seen but still excellent\\, 4 stars because it was just a bit too long and i wanted another lightsaber sequence.
