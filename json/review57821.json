Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was pretty good made the force more spiritual and mysterious. Maybe could of been longer and shouldn\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM)t of removed some deleted scenes. I personally prefer Luke\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM)s depiction here over legends\/expanded universe. (While this is not the only Criticism).  A criticism of the film is luke considering killing kylo ren. personally I have some counter arguments to this. In Star Wars it\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM)s clearly shown that the force influences and almost control and force people similarly to taking drugs or being poccessed by some supernatural being to acts of violence\\, rage\\, revenge\\, anger intensification of fear\\, worry\\, anxiety. In the original trilogy Luke feels this pull to consider killing a defenceless Vader he kills what he believes to be Vader in the swamp. obi wan and yoda clearly state the force can influence people that if you let in to fer and anger the force only intensify a these felling into action. In the prequel trilogy Anakin is influenced by the dark side to kill sand people even the defenceless sand children. The \\nnext scene with yoda clearly shows the dark side is the cause of his actions beyond his control it\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM)s a supernatural force.","true":true}
