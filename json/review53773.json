Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great movie! I'm glad this isn't Empire Strikes Back 2.0. They took a lot of risks and I think it paid off. This movie constantly has you guessing and leaves you with twist after twist. The score is also a step up from The Force Awakens. I only have a few minor gripes. 1. I wasn't a fan of the humor at certain parts\\, I feel like it took away from the tension and atmosphere. The joke at the beginning of the movie is a perfect example. I wish they took out all the jokes where the First Order is involved because they are supposed to be menacing... not a joke. My other minor complaint is that there are story beats that I was excited for that were not touched on. For example\\, I was immensely excited to find out more about the Knights of Ren but they were not touched on at all. You can tell that JJ Abrams set up story beats\\, but Johnson didn't care to flesh to flesh it out further. Those were my main disappointments that kept it from being  my favorite Star Wars movie. I currently rank this as my 4th favorite Star Wars movie and maybe after a second watch it will go up further. \\n\\nThis movie isn't without it's faults\\, but I think the good heavily outweighs the bad. I highly recommend checking it out and if you are a die hard fan then I just ask that you keep an open mind when watching.","true":true}
