Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019ve seen a ton of negative reviews and the one thing I believe most don\u2019t understand is that this movie is a bridge between The Force Awakens and the next installment. Slow at times with some corny comedic moments\\, it\u2019s still a well directed movie that will make you leave thinking about what is yet to come. ","true":true}
