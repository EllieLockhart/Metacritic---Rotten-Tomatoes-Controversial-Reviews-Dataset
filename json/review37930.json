Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The second worse star wars movie in my opinion.  Reasons:  parts of the story that make no sense\\,  decisions made by the characters that are confusing\\, summing up one of the lead characters of the force with a real life twist that he is a failure and a quitter...and going against all the values that the jedi stand for. killing off a great  evil character with lots of potential to be the backbone of further movies.  lots of things that make no sense...i actually was wtf when someone went to hyperspace and destroyed several star destroyers and a ship close to mini death star proportions.  the flings and flair of the battels are pretty as to be expected but do not make up for the poor story choices.","true":true}
