Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don\u2019t know why people are trashing the movie. Maybe it\u2019s due to being simpleminded. All in all the last Jedi had its flaws. But it\u2019s greatness made me forget those flaws. I was on the edge of my seat for a majority of the movie. ","true":true}
