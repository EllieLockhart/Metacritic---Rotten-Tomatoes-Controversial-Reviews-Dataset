I've never played a yakuza game before and the only reason I took interest into this game is because of Angry Joe.  That being said while 60 bucks being spent I decided to give it a go.  Its been a while since I've felt so overwhelmed with joy while a play a story driven game.  The story while boring at first is excellent\\,  and its great how the sub character Majima literally outshines the main character Kiryu\\, makes for some great balance tho.\r\rThe fighting mechanics are simple enough for anyone to pick this up but deep enough to keep you entertained throughout the entire game.   Enemies for the most part are very varied (depending on current situation in story) and pose a challenge every now and then.  Story is great but if you cant tolerate READING probably not for you since entire game is done in Japanese.  I actually prefer it that way but thats just my preference and to each their own. Which comes to my favorite part of the game....Sound?!?!?  Yes the soundtrack to this game is ultra top tier\\, voice acting the best ive seen in a game yet (check out the lieutenant Awano) and sound effects are excellent.  You will just enjoy grating an enemies face against concrete or beating the hell out of them with all allotted weapons.\r\rIf you own a ps4 and you have time and havent given this a try yet shame on you. If your on the fence on this one at least red box it if you can find it that is\\, its worth it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
