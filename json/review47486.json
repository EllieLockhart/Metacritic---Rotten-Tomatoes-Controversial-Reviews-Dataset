Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What is it with SW movies that makes critics soil their pants in fear before giving them a bad review? This movie is Bad with capital B. The script is a mess\\, the characters have the emotional depth of an 8 year old and half of the movie is filler that has absolutely no impact in the final outcome. The action scenes are OK I guess\\, I mean\\, it\u00b4s competently directed and all\\, production quality is good...  but that is a given for a 500million dollar production\\, isn\u00b4t it? At this point I\u00b4m ready to believe that critics will give positive reviews to anything that has the star wars score\\, and people waving glow sticks at each other. That is how low the bar has been set.","true":true}
