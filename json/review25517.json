Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No spoilers in this review. This movie is not bad but it is disappointing. The good: The special effects are done very well\\, with beautiful backdrops. The path of this movie was a surprise. The bad: More often than not the attempt at humor is cheesy. The script builds up hype in plot lines that are then completely disappointing when revealed. There are major holes in the story that makes even this sci fi genre unbelievable. All in all I really wanted to like this movie but it came up short. Instead of getting swept away in the story I found myself trying to make sense of it. I don't know why they went the way they did with the story but as a fan I am discouraged. ","true":true}
