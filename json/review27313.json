Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"On my first viewing of this movie I wasn't sure what to make of it but the more I thought about the movie the more I hated it. The only thing I liked was the visuals and light saber fights. I won't be watching episode 9.","true":true}
