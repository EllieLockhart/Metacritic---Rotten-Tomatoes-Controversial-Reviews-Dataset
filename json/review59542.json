The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Holy **** I\u2019ve tried my absolute hardest to like this game from every conceivable angle\\, but it fails in most of its regards. The characters all feel shallow and lifeless husks of their former selves apart from some of the newer ones. They proceed to then be used as plot devices like Joel dying\\, or the pregnant woman killed by Ellie to demonstrate her \u201cvillainy\u201d. The plot is incoherent and has so many writing sins\\, that it makes young adult novels look like **** Lovecraft in terms of depth and character development. Abby is portrayed as if she is the hero and can do no wrong for most of the game\\, while everything Ellie does is apparently evil and terrifying. One of the worst parts is that the game forgets its set in an apocalyptic setting and treats everything like its grey in terms of morality\\, when in reality it\u2019s only evil and selfishness\\, where everyone does what they can in order to survive. Abby is not a bad character by any means\\, but her motivation is weak in the setting\\, and her development is done poorly. Ellie has a complete character shift in here and will do no good\\, it seems. Joel\u2019s death was absolutely terrible. It is one of the worst examples of an anticlimactic death\\, and just shows us how much plot armor they give Ellie and Abby. You use this trope in order to show how fearsome an enemy is\\, or show that there is no hope. It\u2019s not used as solely a plot device in which you forget how a character treats others\\, and acts like he\u2019s Been their next door neighbor for 20 years. The ending is absolute flaming dog **** There is no depth or anything whatsoever that the fanboys say that there is. It is a cliche that I am tired of seeing in media\\, especially when the perpetrator gets away with no or barely any punishment. To end this **** essay let\u2019s give ideas on how to improve the ending and the game1. Reorganize it. The game could do with Abbys backstory being introduced before Joel\u2019s death.2. Have Abby kill Ellie and regret it or viceversa.3. Have Ellie shoot Abby in the leg\\, and leave her\\, just as she did to Joel.4. Introduce a reason for these two to work together in another game.5. Make Joel do something other than die.6. Remove the sex scene.7. Have the side characters be of more importance. I personally enjoyed them and wished to see more.8. Show that the apocalypse is still occurring\\, and have the infected have an impact on the story\\, probably forcing the two protagonists to work together.This is a game I have tried so hard to love\\, but Neil Druckman has has **** over intensely. Bring back the old director\\, devs\\, and writers.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
