Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is one of the worst movies ever made.  Story is terrible and self conflicting\\, film structure makes almost no sense\\, characters contradict the lore and this middle film in a trilogy destroys all the plot threads and setups for the final film.  This movie is absolutely terrible.","true":true}
