Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They took a few liberties during the princess floating in space seen. I guess they call that Star Wars physics. Luke was a bit disappointing with his new found diet of big fish and green space seal milk. Overall entertaining\\, but not great.","true":true}
