Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A very dissapointing conclusion to a two year wait... This movie chooses not to answer any questions that emerged after \\\"The Force Awakens\\\". Ryan Johnson takes a beloved franchise and twists it and it's really sad to see the critics applaud this. Boring Subplots\\, Poor decisions made by almost every character in the movie and Concluding the movie in a way that a lot of new world building will be required in the next episode. If you thought that the Attack of Clones was the worst Star Wars movie\\, it is reasonable to say that it now has a worthy Challenger. If you loved the original trilogy\\, this movie may ruin everything you loved about it. At the end\\, Im desperate to see how JJ Abraham's finishes the final movie and maybe salvage this triology after all....\\n\\nMay the Force be with this franchise always....it needs it right now more than ever...","true":true}
