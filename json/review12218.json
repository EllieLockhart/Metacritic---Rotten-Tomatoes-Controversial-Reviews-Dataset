Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am giving this one star actually having seen this film at a midnight screening and have given it time to digest. I came out disappointed and thought\\, it wasn't as bad as the prequels but by no means as good as Empire as the critics said. However\\, on reflection\\, what an absolute mess of a movie. I wasn't a massive fan of TFA\\, but it did a job and was better than the prequels. This however comes along and rips apart that story line. The plot is all over the shop\\, the screen writing is terrible and destroys the lore in parts. There is 0 character development for the new ones\\, which means you have 0 emotional investment. They also ruin established characters. I find I don't hate it\\, as there are some genuine good bits but it's a little bit like being told off as a kid and being told your actions are a disappointment and it hurts that little bit more. I take my hat off to Mark and Carrie for dealing with such terrible scripts. I only hope Disney take notice of the fans\\, remove Rian from this new trilogy and somehow JJ can salvage this mess.","true":true}
