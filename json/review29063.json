Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really liked it. Rian Johnson made an epic. Really enjoyed how despite all the set up in the first film it didn't seem to matter in the second. Felt a little like game of thrones where we might see the origins of Snoke. Nope\\, doesn't matter. It's all about the kids. Loved it. Kept me enthralled.","true":true}
