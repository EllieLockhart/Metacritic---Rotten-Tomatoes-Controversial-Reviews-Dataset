Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"too many weird things (bomb drop\\, curved turbolaser bolt)\\, along with stupid plot line (amiral holdo refusing to explain her plan to the crew\\, which led to a useless mutiny and the finn\/rose subplot which went nowhere)\\, the lamest fleet chase (a rehash of battlestar galactica) and all that feminism agenda being pushed ... not the star wars that enlighted my life when I was 12yo when star wars was released ... I'm so damn depressed\\, star wars was my whole life and now I have nothing. I cant accept this.","true":true}
