Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was shocked at how stupid some of the scenes were;  don't be a hero\\, oh wait\\, be a hero; follow orders\\, oh wait\\, don't follow orders when you have love; there is good and evil\\, oh wait\\, the evil have better ideas than the good; introduce new characters\\, oh wait\\, we don't need them; don't let your army die; oh wait\\, let's be happy that everybody died.  Horrible movie.   The jedi have died. ","true":true}
