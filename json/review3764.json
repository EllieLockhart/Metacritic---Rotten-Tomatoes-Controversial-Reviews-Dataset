Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Better than the prequels\\, not as good as the originals. Also not as good as rogue one or even the force awakens. This film suffers from shoehorned in social commentary (which they haven't even tried to make subtle) \\nThe plot holes are glaring\\, character assassinations criminal and clearly those making the film don't truly understand or indeed care for Star Wars. As time goes on I find myself liking the film less and less. And the arguments online are so toxic it's unbelievable. Yes some negative fans are going overboard but dismissing all of them as just crybabies who's fan theories were wrong is a mistake. Many previous films\\, including Star Wars\\, have taken the story in directions that the fans didn't expect and not been hated for it.","true":true}
