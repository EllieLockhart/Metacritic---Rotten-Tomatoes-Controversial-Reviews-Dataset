Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have watched the movie 2 times now.  The first time in the theater and the second online.  I do not feel like lining Disney pockets on this one like I did for TFA.  This movie is not HORRIBLE\\, however has more opportunities then it has wins.  If Rian Johnson filmed this as a fan then I would hate to see what he would have done as a non-fan. Rose is completely annoying and pointless.  Finn should have had his swan song at the end to really bring people into the movie.  Kylo Ren needs to have a mask in 9 because the villain needs to be Threatening\/Scary\/Ominous.   Can we get an epic lightsaber battle?  I honestly think they trapped themselves with Kylo's saber because he can obviously not use it very well due to its unusual size and shape.","true":true}
