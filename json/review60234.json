Joel's death What they say :- poorly dealt Fact:- he dies in the hands of the person he just saves by getting his leg shot with a shotgun and beaten to death with a golf stick. That is painful psychologically and physically. People wanted a predictable lame death of Joel??2. Abby getting to live in the endWhat they say:- it sucks to see Ellie not getting her revengeFact:- Ellie got her revenge. Abby was able to kill Joel because her group outnumbered Joel and Tommy. Ellie kills her group therefore killing the indirect reason that helped Abby kill joel. And Ellie killed the Abby that killed Joel by making Abby realise that revenge only got innocent people killed.3. Structure and pacingWhat people say:- the game is slow and boringFact:- these are blind haters who are probably xbox fans because the 1st game has the same pacing and that game is awesome!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
