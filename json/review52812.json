Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A lot of fun to watch\\, but the story was weak and didn't do much to push the franchise forward. It felt more like SW 7.5 than an episode 8.","true":true}
