Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last jedi is visually stunning\\, convention breaking and a bold new direction for the starwars franchise. Jj abrams was called for his linear safe storyline that followed the old starwars formula and now  Rian has tried to go the opposite way he has been criticized harshly. I dont think fans know what they want anymore and if we got it we would still complain. I believe we must wait till starwars episode ix before we can make full judgements on this sequel.","true":true}
