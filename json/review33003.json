Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Story was horrible no real plot run Johnson threw everything feat out the window Luke didn't act anything like he did in any other movie I think rianbiohnson ruined it put a bad taste in my mouth","true":true}
