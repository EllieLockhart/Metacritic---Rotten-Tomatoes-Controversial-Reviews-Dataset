Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok\\, just saw the new Star Wars movie.  Wow\\, it was terrible.  Were the critics paid to say this movie was good?   I have been a long time Star Wars fan\\, not any more.  Too many plot holes\\, inconsistencies\\, shameless creature cameos for plush toy sales (I'm talking about you Porgs) \\, and the total disregard of the history and feel of a Star Wars movie.  This will be the last Star Wars movie I will see.  So sad\\, so much potential.","true":true}
