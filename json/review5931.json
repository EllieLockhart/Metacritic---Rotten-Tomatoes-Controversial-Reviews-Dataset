Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing.  Loved TFA and RO\\, but this was a mess.  The chemistry between Rey and Finn was thrown out for this episode.  Luke out of character as a shattered mess who considered killing his nephew (after always believing there was good in his father) and literally milking an alien?  Really?  Flying Leia?  How did that honor Ms. Fisher's memory?  New characters for which no interest is developed.  Cute little creatures only in the movie for the purpose of selling toys\\, perhaps?  All the women are brilliant but the men are lacking (I'm a woman saying this)?  RJ never should have been given this\\, and it leaves me with concern as he looks toward Ep 10 - 12.","true":true}
