Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I created this account simply to add a 1 star review. everyone has already said what needs to be said. This movie sucks\\, has too many plot holes\\, is full with SJW agendas such as feminisim\\,veganism\\, \\\"must have diversity\\\" cause god forbid if we don't have a movie with at least 1 of every ethnicity... what's next? hassidic jews in starwars? (i'm an Israeli jew and i think that idea is just stupid) and of course the \\\"capitzlism is bad\\\" idea in the stupid casino planet... i've never seen a more redundant sub-plot.\\n\\nNo true fan of starwars will ever accept this movie\\, only the fanatics.\\n\\nfuck this movie\\, fuck Mr.Johnson and fuck that bitch of a woman who controls starwars now and takes pictures with a shirt that says \\\"the force is a woman\\\"...  I mean god damn how more pathetic can you be?","true":true}
