Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you're an old school Star Wars fan\\, you probably won't like this film.  It seems Rian Johnson's only goal in the film was to subvert your expectations.  Well\\, mission accomplished and it was disappointing.","true":true}
