Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have no idea how the score is so high for this movie\\, clearly the name Star Wars is holding too much weight for a terrible movie. Pacing jumped all over the place\\, editing was off on some cuts\\, humor was cheap\\, lots of moments fell flat(you could feel the discomfort of everyone else in the theater during the cringe-worthy moments)\\, Finn's journey was completely pointless\\, acting wasn't good\\, and the writing was even worse. \\n\\nKylo Ren's\\, Luke and Rey's moments were great. Definitely should have put the entire focus on them for this movie. Everything else could have been cut out.","true":true}
