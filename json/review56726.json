Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is feeding us plot hole over plot hole. Characters make unrealistic and out of character decisions throughout the movie. I\u00b4m left bewildered and extremely sad for this franchise. As a single movie (without having seen) any of the previous films it does look quite good tho\\, but with knowing the story what came before its just a big mess. \\n\\nJust one examples... If ships in star wars have no defence what so ever against other small ships moving at light speed then why even bother building the Death Star\\, just shoot things (ships\/planets) with x-wings at light speed and the galaxy is on its knees. Stupid\\, stupid writing.\\n\\nSeems like no thought was given to the state of the galaxy. Where did the First Order come from? Wasnt the Republic supposed to be in charge for the last 30-40 years? Suddenly the galaxy is filled with the First Order with unlimited resources (but miserably unable to destroy a few space ships a few kilometers ahead for 5 hours).\\n\\nAnd guys\\, why make Luke a cowardly weak lying child killer? I am so sorry Luke and Mark Hamill... you did not deserve this treatment.","true":true}
