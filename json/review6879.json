Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dreadfull on so many levels. Poor character development\\, pointless sideplots\\, badly choreographed fights\\, total ignorance and disrespect of OT characters\\, introduction of really annoying new characters - Holdo\\, DJ\\, Rose - (officialy worse than JarJar). Ridiculous main plot\\, most boring space chase ever. And once again Rey is better than everyone from every star wars entry at everything\\, with no training\\, experience or mentor. Those behind this implosion of Star Wars claim it \\\"subverts expectations\\\". All it subverted for me was my cash\\, and my absoloute love for this franchise. Star Wars is officially dead.
