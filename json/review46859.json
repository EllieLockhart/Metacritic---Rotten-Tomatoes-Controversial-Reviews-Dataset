Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well this one was good but stacking it up against the others\\, it may fall a little short. The story is good and the action sequences are pretty sweet but I just didnt enjoy it like the others. Still worth watching.","true":true}
