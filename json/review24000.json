Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Many say it is a Bad Star wars Movie\\, but a great movie overall...I say it is a bad star wars movie and a bad movie\\, the main plot is about nothing and the subplots takes you nowhere\\, they don't add anything to the main story and it's in vain (Finn and Rose plot) Rey's journey adds nothing to her character and Luke is a weak character\\, troubled yes\\, but still adds nothing to the story. The movie contain lots of continuity errors and forced humor\\, the best of the movie is the stunning effects and music. From the Star wars fan point of view\\, it is clear that Disney is dissing the old fanbase and focusing in building a new one\\, it is clear that they want to detach from the old Star wars and begin a new era\\, were the force is no longer about the mysticism\\, where the force is more like a super power that can be acquired rather than a discipline and a way of life\\, it is not about the \\\"space samurai & galactic politics\\\" they throw away all the star wars narrative and embrace their common \\\"Marvel\\\" narrative\\, simplistic and hollow. The movie is not horrible to watch\\, but it is an insult to the fans old and new\\, Star wars will become a \\\"Zombie\\\" franchise reducing it's quality in future installments\\, it works with marvel (sort of) but it won't  work on star wars.","true":true}
