We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Amazing!  If you liked the first one then you\u2019ll love this\\, it\u2019s more of the same but bigger\\, faster\\, more detailed\\, more immersive!  The story isn\u2019t as good as the first one but it\u2019s a different game\\, it does however feel like a continuation of the story from the first game and certain events that take place however terrible they may be you can perhaps understand why those involved wanted to do what they did!   It\u2019s by no means a bad story\\, it\u2019s not bad at all it\u2019s just different but still fantastic!! Makes you think is revenge ever worth it? The way the game invokes emotion is unreal\\, I had stopped playing a couple of times as it was all too much!  I felt drained in the same way you\u2019d expect the characters to be tired!  Where in the first game you could strategically hide in one location for as long as you like whilst planning your next move\\, in part 2 they NPC\u2019s are looking for you and will find you!  This keeps you on your toes constantly!  The gameplay is effortless and everything you want to do\\, can be done!  On a technical level\\, it\u2019s a masterpiece\\, i look at the reflections and although i know they didn\u2019t use ray tracing\\, the reflections are just that good!  The frame rate is solid 30fps in 1440p on the Pro and only the only time it ever dipped was when i was in water!  Which i might add accounts for about 2 mins of the 30hours in game.This game is a must have\\, if you don\u2019t get it then it\u2019s you\u2019re loss entirely!  Honestly 10 out of 10 and possibly the best game of this generation and one of the top ten greatest games ever released!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
