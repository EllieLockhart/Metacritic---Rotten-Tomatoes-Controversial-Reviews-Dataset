Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What an amazing trip I have now seen it two time in the cinema and found it breathtaking. A cleaver balance of whit\\, jokes\\, action and drama with a touch of romance. I'm a 46 year old fan who watched Star Wars in the drive-in in 1977 I met and fell in love with my wife at a star wars fan club 22 years ago so I have a big chunk of my heart invested in this franchise. The Last Jedi is up in the ranks of the original saga.","true":true}
