Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great entertaining movie...the casino scene was a waste but the overall movie was excellent and I can\u2019t wait to see how it all plays out in the next one ","true":true}
