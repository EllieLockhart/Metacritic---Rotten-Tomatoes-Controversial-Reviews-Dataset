Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Incredibly well directed\\, well written\\, and well acted. Riveting from start to finish. While there was some slowness in the middle\\, it's because this Star Wars film was filled with so much substance. Not to mention\\, the action is insanly good. A must see Star Wars film\\, incredibly necessary for the trilogy and timeline. I'm going to watch this again\\, and again!","true":true}
