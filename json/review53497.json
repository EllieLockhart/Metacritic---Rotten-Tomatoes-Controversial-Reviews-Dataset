Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Do you want to watch a reboot of the Star Wars franchise? Then Episodes 7 & 8 are for you! These movies don't adhere to the universe created by the original 6 movies. Now any seemingly random girl from a desert planet\\, or slave boy from a casino planet can learn to use the ways of the Force at will... whenever they feel like it! No training required! Which seems like they're just setting it up for more Force users without any training will just be popping up all over the galaxy. No special Jedi training required anymore\\, now anyone can use the Force! These are modern blockbuster spectacles with lots of action and explosions that will keep you entertained for a few hours\\, but leave you feeling hollow at the end. This is not the Star Wars I fell in love with. Sorry... These new Star Wars are not for me.","true":true}
