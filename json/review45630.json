Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disapponting. Still at a loss for words. I really like The Force Awakens\\, and this movie just craps on that. And the whole Saga for that matter. Rian Johnson seems like a really nice guy\\, but this movie is just wrong on so many levels. Feeling very upset by this movie. Hopefully JJ can salvage this sequel trilogy.","true":true}
