Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst movie of all time!  Way to ruin the universal hero of our times Luke Skywalker.  He had brought people together by millions\\, gave us hope\\, and showed us the way to resist evil temptations - even to rule the galaxy - in the name of good old fashion doing what's right.  Luke risked his life and sacrificed his training because he sensed his friends were in danger.  He faced his fears to confront both his father and the emperor\\, risking everything for the chance to turn his fatter from the dark side.  But now\\, he's decided\\, like a coward\\, to shut off the force power in him\\, abandon his sister\\, best friends\\, and the entire galaxy.  He just gives up.  Heads to an island to die.  This broke my heart.  You have no idea!\\n\\nThis is not Star Wars.  George Lucas created Star Wars. 1-3 are the villain's journey and 4-6 the hero's journey.  7-9 will go down in history as just crap that other people wrote based on Star Wars by George Lucas.","true":true}
