Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i've been a star wars fan my whole life.. and for me the news that disney bought star wars and would make a new trilogy was amazing.\\nthe force awakens wasnt a very good movie in my opinion\\, but at least it set up some stuff to explore in a new movie.\\nthan the last jedi came. and usualy i just think about a movie to be good or not realy... but this time i got pain in my stomach and i felt anger comming..\\nthe last jedi managet to be wors than the christmas special.. and i didnt knew that was even possible.. i feel very dissapointed about TLJ and i cannot understand how someone could make a movie so bad\\, so disrespectfull and overall bad.","true":true}
