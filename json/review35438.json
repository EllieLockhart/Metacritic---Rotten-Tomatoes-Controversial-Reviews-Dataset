Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi delivers an emotional response\\, perhaps at the expense of bringing more scope to proceedings\\, even so the emotional connection is welcome\\, and the visual palette is outstanding\\, the richest of any Star Wars film.","true":true}
