Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really hate how they added a women and a black person to this no I'm not racist or sexist I just miss the old star wars it so much better I just feel like they added a black person and a women just because of popular media talk about blm and feminsitic notions also rogue one and this movie is basically going to be the same thing as all the other movies they even used the same title as the previous movies nothing has changed except the actors  really   but the concept remains the same for pple who are fond of the old star wars we like to see  somthing new not jyst new actors but newer scenery newer planets newer beings all I feel with it is there's a new Darth Vader and a new Jedi trying to defeat his father again at least have something worth while story wise .","true":true}
