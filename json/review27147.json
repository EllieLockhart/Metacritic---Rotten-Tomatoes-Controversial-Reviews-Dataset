Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the worst movies I have seen related to star wars... How can they justify the main bad guy they had been building up one shoted and STILL since they killed all the build up? Or how Rey is STILL a mary sue and has not been improved on at all. She can still beat hardened fighters without proper training\\, she can still fly ships despite being on a desert planets. Say what you like about Luke\\, at least he got his ass kicked and showed he TRAINED. Disappointment\\, from a long time fan.","true":true}
