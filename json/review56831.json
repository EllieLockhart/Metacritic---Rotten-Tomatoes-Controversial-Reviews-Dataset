Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are several scenes that are visually attractive\\, as well as some admirable performances on the part of the actors who were handed an exhaustive script. That said\\, the bad fat out-weighs the good here. The openening scene dealt the audience a poorly excecuted and out-of-place \u00ef\u00bf 1\/2yo momma\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2\u00c2? joke that completely deflated any tension or suspsense. The plot is Swiss cheese\\, requiring the audience to write the script in their heads in order to make any sense of what progression is attempting to take place. Agendas aside\\, there seems to be little character development taking place\\, the plot doesn\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM)t make much sense\\, and the movie ran about 30 minutes longer than it probably should have. This could go on for days\\, but I\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM)ll end by saying that the legacy characters present in this movie were arguably disrespected to the point of disbelief. If I could erase the imagine of green sea-walrus tittie milk dripping from Luke Skywalker\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM)s chin\\, I would be forever grateful. Thank you\\, Mr. Johnson; I was expecting a decent movie\\, and my expectations were certainly subverted.","true":true}
