Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't understand the negativity I'm seeing about this movie! \\n\\nI thought it was wonderful all around. There was great action\\, fun humor and emotional pull. I loved all the different story lines and can't wait to go see it again.","true":true}
