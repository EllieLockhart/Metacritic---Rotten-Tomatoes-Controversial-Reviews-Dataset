Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi gets many things right. It's fun and exciting however\\, some major moments in this film are huge to Star Wars and leave fans wondering what will happen next\\, I don't think those moments should have made the film. Johnson has created a fantastic film though and I enjoyed this film.","true":true}
