Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I only came here to say this was the 2nd worse Star Wars movie ever made. I am one of the biggest SW fans out there ever. The story telling was atrocious\\, the plot had more holes then swiss cheese\\, the pacing made no sense & the way they handled Luke was the biggest let down ever. Kathleen Kennedy has also injected too much female empowerment in these films and it shows with Durn\\, Fisher\\, Ridley. Add in the political overtones of the current real world climate in here\\, the resist movement & the P.E.T.A 15 min scene this movie could go down as one of the biggest failures of Disney\/SW universe. The 3 new main characters are dull\\, lifeless\\, un-likeable. Hamill deserved better then this mess with his character. I'm not sure who green lit the script but this could basically cost RJ any chance to direct\/write the next trilogy. I've never seen a movie throw LITERALLY everything away from the last one that was set-up & fill it with 2.5 hours of random scenes\/story that did not connect\/flow at all. Disappointed is an understatement. Also when you have to continue to put flashbacks in movies\\, that tell you your storytelling is very weak that you have to explain what happened or that you think your audience is too dumb to figure it out. We didn't have to see these weird scenes\/flashbacks. They were terrible. There is nothing likable\/endearing to the new 3 cast & Disney missed the chance here to do more with Luke\/Han\/Leia while bringing the new 3 into the fold over 3 movies but after seeing TLJ\\, there is no hope for this franchise anymore. IV\/V\/VI will never be replaced and we'll never get that back.","true":true}
