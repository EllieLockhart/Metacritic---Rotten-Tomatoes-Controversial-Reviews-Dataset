Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Forty-something year olds\\, we all have to understand this is Star Wars for a new generation.\\\"\\n\\nWell\\, then call it STAR WARS NEW GENERATION and stop destroying and humiliating the characters of the original trilogy.\\n\\nIs that asking too much?\\n\\nI'm not interested in the NEW GENERATION\\, though\\, so I will not buy tickets for watching those movies. No \\\"hardcore fan\\\" will buy tickets for them\\, and this is why Disney did not tell us that it was a Star Wars for a new generation. They wanted our money\\, so they tricked us into believing that The Last Jedi was a REAL Star Wars Movie. Watch the trailers and then tell me that they did not hint at that.\\n\\nThere is only one thing I want to tell Disney:\\n\\nFuck me once. I blame you.\\nFuck me twice\\, I blame myself.","true":true}
