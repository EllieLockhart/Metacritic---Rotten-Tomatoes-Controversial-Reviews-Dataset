{"101487":174519,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force Awakens gave us so many interesting questions to answer: Who are the first order?\\nWho is Snoke?\\nWho is Captain Phasma?\\nWhy did Ren fall to the dark side?\\nWhy does Rey have powers?\\nWho are Rey's parents?\\nWhy did the New Republic fail?\\nWhere did Luke go?\\nOf these questions\\, two were answered\\, and they both stem from the destruction of Luke Skywalker as a character. Luke apparently pushed Ben into the darkside in an entirely uncharacteristic bout of near-murder and to atone\\, cut himself off from everything including the force rather than try to fix it as we know he would have done in the original trilogy.\\nEvery other question\\, the writer's essentially said: It doesn't matter.\\n\\nNo seriously\\, we still have no idea who the first order is\\, who captain phasma is\\, why Rey has powers\\, who her parents are\\, who snoke is and why he is suddenly almighty powerful\\, and finally\\, why the New Republic was disastrously ineffective.\\n\\nThe first Order isn't scary\\, its inept. You are chasing people who cant jump away. Should you A) keep everyone behind them or B) Jump a few destroyers in front of them and annihilate them. Hux is a whipping boy who lacks all the gravitas of previous villains like Admiral Piet. The first order controls the galaxy but seriously how incompetent are these guys\\, and how much more so does everyone else have to be for them to reign supreme?\\n\\nAdd to that\\, the utter disaster that is the characters in this movie. Po\\, whose defining trait is defying orders nearly gets everyone killed twice. Finn whose defining trait is cowardice accomplishes nothing. Rose\\, whose humor is totally out of place\\, suddenly loves Finn enough to stop him from accomplishing character development and sacrifice after literally 18 hours real time\\, then somehow survives despite being 50ft from an advancing Imperial invasion force. Vice Admiral unimportant who suddenly shows up\\, and is best friends with Leia\\, could prevent half the conflict with this plot by simply telling Po her plan\\, sacrifices herself... Why couldn't Admiral Akbar\\, an established character\\, who was killed offscreen\\, have filled this role? It would have been so much more meaningful\\, and so much more touching than introducing\\, barely building and suddenly eliminating a character we know nothing about. She means nothing to me\\, and while her final act was cool\\, if that could be done\\, why not do it with the other craft first and simply win the fight? Or\\, you know with the previous 2 death stars? Then we have Leia who suddenly can Merry Poppins herself both out of the void and out of an excellent\\, poetic and utterly beautiful resolution to her story. And don't forget\\, we have Luke who has forgotten everything he learned during episodes 5 and 6\\, and who serves as nothing more than a punching bag that allows the director to tear down everything starwars that came before. \\n\\nFinally\\, Rey. I hate this character because she does not fail. At anything. Merely experiences setbacks caused by other people. Need to fly a ship even though you've never been on one? Can do it perfectly. Need to fix anything\\, like the Falcon? Can do it better than Solo. Need a master bladesman who can take on a trained (albiet injured) sith? Will put episode 2 Anakin to total shame. Need a mindtrick to continue the plot? Don't get up Obi. Need to lift 100 tonnes of material despite never having done it before? Take a seat episode 5 Luke\\, Rey is here. There were so many opportunities for her to show that she is human\\, the darkside cave\\, turning Kylo\\, her fight with Luke\\, the list goes on. But no\\, she passes every test barely breaking a sweat. \\n\\nKid Anakin was really\\, really bad\\, but his actions can mostly be attributed to a combination of luck and being the chosen one of the force. And really\\, this is a stretch and wasn't good writing then. And even so\\, we see teenage and adult Anakin fail. A lot. Kills a bunch of Tusken raiders\\, fails to keep Padme safe\\, gets his arm chopped off\\, kills a prisoner\\, commits sins against the Jedi code of fear\\, anger\\, hate\\, pride and love and finally falls to the darkside. Luke is even more incompetent. He succeeds at two things in his career: blowing up the deathstar\\, which he had tremendous\\, lifesaving help doing\\, and besting his father in the last episode. He fails\\, at almost everything else\\, and has to be saved so many times it's a clich\u00e9. But Rey? Rey never fails. Everything works out for her because... well we never actually answer that other than saying the force chose her to counter balance the darkness of Kylo. \\nThus Anakin\\, the most powerful Jedi in their history\\, temple trained for years\\, can still fail and be shown to have flaws. Luke a farmboy\\, whose only talent of flying is explained as being both hereditary and practiced on Tatooine\\, succeeds in the end but only by struggling and fighting and failing the entire time. Rey has no failures or flaws\\, other than the entirely forgivable sin of being too na\u00efve and idealistic. In short\\, she doesn't earn the power bestowed on her\\, and it feels so wrong after the previous protagonists.\\n\\nThere is some good in this movie. The set pieces were amazing and the visuals were gorgeous. The score was perfect and punctuated climatic moments incredibly well. As for characters\\, Mark Hamill is truly excellent in his role as hermit Luke. Despite how they destroyed his character\\, Mark makes Luke's fall truly believable and potently emotional. His death was illogical and seemed entirely out of place after the previous scenes\\, but nonetheless\\, it struck home with amazing\\, poignant sadness. And then we have Adam Driver. \\nKylo Ren is the sole redeeming character currently alive in Star Wars cannon. His character actually develops. From idolizing his grandfather\\, Vader\\, to becoming conflicted about his allegiances\\, to realizing that the only way to free himself of the legacy of the past is to simply let the past burn. Kylo is deep\\, complex\\, emotional and human. He fails. He regroups. He fails again. Each time learning something about himself. I did not like the portrayal of this character in the Force Awakens\\, but the development in the Last Jedi suddenly justifies the pettiness and shallow motives of Kylo in the Force Awakens. And Adam driver plays it perfectly\\, to the point where I wanted Rey to join him in burning down the rest of the old world. It would have given Rey so much more depth\\, but no her character is an ocean an inch deep\\, while Kylo is a raging river whose currents must carry the entirety of this franchise. \\n\\nOne half star in this review is for Mark\\, the visuals and the score. One full star is for Adam Driver\\, may his shoulders be broad enough for the weight of Star Wars.\\n\\nEpisode 9 will have a lot of things to answer for\\, and I sincerely hope that the franchise can be redeemed. There is still good in it.","true":true}
