Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought that nothing could be any worse than Episode VIi\\, the Farce awakens - but they managed it with the last Jedi.- unfortunately it won't be the last\\, \\nWhat's wrong with it? - Bad & wooden acting\\, non-funny funny bits\\, Porgs\\, Lord Voldemort\\, Porgs\\, cute little moppets wielding brooms and pretending to be jedi\\, Porgs\\, a plot so thin it wasn't there\\, bad editing\\, Porgs a complete disregard of Physical laws - namely explosive decompression\\, Porgs\\, a guest appearance by Dobby the house-elf\\, and last but not least PORGS!
