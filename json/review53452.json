Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney should retitle this: \\\"Star Wars: Running Out of Gas.\\\" Visually stunning\\, but \\\"Last Jedi\\\" is a disjointed\\, plodding story with a bizarre characterization of Luke (Quoting Mark Hamill: \\\"He's not my Luke Skywalker\\\"). Two and a half hours about running low on fuel and whether the Jedi should exist ... Time to watch \\\"Rogue One\\\" again to cleanse the palate.","true":true}
