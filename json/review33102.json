Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Subverting expectation is Rian Johnson's goal in this film and he seems to achieve this exceptionally. This may rub some people on the internet the wrong way\\, but it is fresh and exciting (in my opinion\\, at least). John Williams delivers\\, as always. If you have issues with the plot\\, at least you can't say anything about the visuals. This film looks spectacular! I believe that this film will stand the test of time - it may take a while for portions of the audience to catch up\\, though.","true":true}
