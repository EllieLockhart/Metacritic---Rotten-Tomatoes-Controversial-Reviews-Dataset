Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I honestly do not know which character or theme I'm supposed to be rooting for or against. This movie is special effects plus star wars branding on top of a soul-less narrative.","true":true}
