Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It breaks SW canon and has major plot holes which are clear even for non-hardcore viewer of the saga. As a life long Star Wars fan I stopped putting any money in this franchise after seeing this movie long time ago. Characters are badly written and simply boring which is unheard of. Visually beautiful movie which is empty inside.","true":true}
