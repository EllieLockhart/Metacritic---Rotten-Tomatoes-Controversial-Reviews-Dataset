Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am blown away by the backlash this movie is receiving. This is one of the best Star Wars films yet. I don't understand how people are saying that this is a terrible mess when it simply isn't. My theory is that people are just mad that Luke didn't get as much screen time as they liked or were mad that they're moving the franchise to new heros. I think it's great that they told a new original story with new and incredible characters and creatures. I find it mind boggling that people are finding this worse than episodes 1 and 2. Kylo Ren is the best villain in Star Wars. He isn't just a dark figure who is bad because he uses the Dark Side of the force. He had inner conflict\\, clear motivations\\, and his dynamic with Rey is o be of the best things on the movie. If there is one thing about this movie that I would say is bad is the Porgs but they are just like the Ewoks and not even near to the level of the Gungans. ","true":true}
