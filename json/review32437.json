Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars is part of my blood and I bet that in a few years\\, this film will be remembered as fondly as Empire. Sure\\, there are some clunky lines of dialog\\, but it's Star Wars. That happens. Sure\\, there's an unneccessary plotline film-wise\\, but internally it's a logical one. Above all of this\\, I just loved it.","true":true}
