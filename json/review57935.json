Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Whatever JJ Abrams had planned obviously didn't matter. This film has no continuity from the Force Awakens\\, yet offers little to nothing in it's place to make up for it. The characters are dull\\, the story line is woeful and the real world political agenda push is unreal. TLJ is a world filled with nothing but wonderous women and man-splaining misogynists. Every male character is whittled down to a pathetic joke whilst our lead female is a complete Mary Sue\\, she's somehow a better pilot than Han Solo\\, prettier than Leia and stronger than Luke\\, all of which she has managed with no lineage and\/or training whilst living as a scavenger in the desert her whole life. \\n\\nWe have well and truly hit rock bottom with films lately\\, any whiff of a female lead and Hollywood has to start fighting the patriarchy. Vader wouldn't have stood for this crap..","true":true}
