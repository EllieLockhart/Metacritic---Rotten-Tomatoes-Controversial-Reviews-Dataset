Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible flow\\, majority of acting bad (notable exception Mark Hamill)\\, an absurdly high amount of slapstick humor (note to writers: Star Wars has never needed much\\, if any comic relief).  The worst part is the manner in which the movie departs from (and in my eyes\\, ruins)\\, the traditions and main themes of Star Wars.  Disney has surely irreparably harmed this franchise.  It is more clear now why\\, in the middle of production for VIII\\, JJ Abrams decided to direct IX himself\\, and why Hamill was upset with the movie's development.  (Spoiler Alert) I have to believe Hamill\\, based on seeing the script\\, requested to be killed off and be untethered from this Titanic.","true":true}
