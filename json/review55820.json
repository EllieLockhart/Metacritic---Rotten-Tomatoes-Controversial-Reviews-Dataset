Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*Possible Spoilers BEWARE*\\n\\n\\nWe're finally here\\, the sequel to Star Wars: The Force Awakens\\, the Empire Strikes Back of this new trilogy\\, the film that was supposed to be so dark and so different and so good that it gave the director Rian Johnson a whole trilogy to his own. Does it deliver? I'm sad to say\\, that as of Christmas Eve of 2017\\, after a good few days of thought and discussion\\, I cannot say it delivers. The one word I can use to describe it is just\\, disappointing. \\n\\nLet me start off by saying that this is not a bad film so to speak\\, it is beautifully shot\\, has a recognizable score\\, great acting\\, and some amazing action sequences. However\\, past that\\, when it comes to the actual story and how it progresses the Star Wars lore\\, I don't think the film delivers in anyway.\\n\\nThe Force Awakens set up so many aspects of this new trilogy that were supposedly going to be answered or explored deeper in this film. Who are Rey's parents? Who is Snoke? What has Luke been doing this whole time? And so many more questions were established and built up in The Force Awakens only to be thrown out or shut down or just laid to rest in an extremely boring way in this film. The answer to the questions about Snoke are just thrown out as none of them are answered at all\\, the question about Rey's parents is explained but in such a boring way and a confusing way that it honestly doesn't make a whole lot of sense. The entire character of Luke\\, which I honestly was mostly okay with\\, was changed around and twisted. The movie had huge twists and turns\\, some landed perfectly while some missed the mark for me. As a Star Wars fan\\, I just can't sit back and accept some of the answers and some of the events in the film as they transpire. I can't just accept that Luke went to that distant island to die\\, I can't just accept that we never see him do anything of significance in the film besides die\\, I can't just accept that Snoke is gone and we will never learn about him even though just before his death he was flinging Rey around like a ragdoll while barely moving his finger. The film was inconsistent with lore\\, it dropped so much of the lore into the trash\\, and it just felt so unsatisfying that\\, as a huge fan of the series I can't give it a 5 star rating. These opinions may change as time goes on\\, as I watch the film over and over\\, and as Episode 9 rolls around\\, but as it stands today\\, I have to rate this film near the bottom of the totem pole.","true":true}
