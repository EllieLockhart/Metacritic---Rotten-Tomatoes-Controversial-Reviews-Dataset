This game isn\u2019t afraid of closely and uncomfortably examining the consequences. In my opinion\\, there really wasn\u2019t any other way to justify a sequel to the near-perfect game that TLOU was.Gameplay wise\\, (though admittedly a bit dated) everything TLOU did\\, this one does better. The tension\\, the environmental storytelling\\, and the fluidity\\, the balance of control vs desperation in any given combat scenario - all of it has been perfected. I do my best to temper expectations going into any game I\u2019m excited about\\, but I\u2019m almost relieved to say that this one DELIVERS and then some.Bravo\\, ND\\, keep doing what you do and I can\u2019t wait to see what y\u2019all do next.Gamers\\, please keep an open mind and just TRY this one out. There\u2019s a lot of fun to be had at the end of the day\\, regardless of how you feel about the representation on display here. Which isn\u2019t a bad thing come on.... because THE STORY WORKS.TLDR; great game\\, you owe it to yourself to try it out if you own a PS4\\, keep an open mind and don\u2019t just pile on to a work of art without adequate context and information.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
