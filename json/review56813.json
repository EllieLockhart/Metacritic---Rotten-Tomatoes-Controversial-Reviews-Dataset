Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The plot of the story has holes that you could pilot a dreadnought through. The main premise of the story is ludicrous\\, the few rebel ships travel slightly faster than the First Order so the main thrust of the movie is an exceedingly slow motion chase until the rebels run out of gas (wait\\, what!) \\n\\nThere is a side mission that turns out to be entirely contrived and unnecessary\\, with some huge leaps of logic. \\n\\nIf you think Rey's character was very overpowered in TFA\\, Rian Johnson basically says \\\"hold my coat JJ Abrams\\\" and turns her character into \\\"Mary Sue\\\" levels of incredulity. She is better than Luke\\, Snoke\\, all Snokes personal guards\\, Vader and Ren with no training at all and within 5 minutes of knowing what the force is.\\n\\nThe humor is contrived and out of place\\, in my showing only one person in the entire audience laughed at any of the Marvel style dumb jokes.\\n\\nThere are many face-palm moments - including Luke being totally out of character for the whole movie\\, Rose knowing Finn for a couple of hours and putting the entire rebel alliance at risk because she is somehow hopelessly in love with him. She spoils Finns best and defining moment. \\n\\nLuke's cow milking is the most absurd and un-necessary scene I've seen in any Star Wars film\\, and possibly any movie\\, along with Leia's dead... oh wait... Gotcha I'm not! Superman flight\\, followed by opening space doors and no-one getting sucked out to space. DUMB\\, DUMB\\, DUMB.\\n\\nThe movie is also blatantly full of political correctness\\, including a string of characters that practically have \\\"hello I'm a feminist\\\" tattooed onto their foreheads.\\n\\nPorgs are a plain cash-grab. I wont be participating in future as Disneys milking of the franchise is becoming as ugly as Lukes space cow milking scene.","true":true}
