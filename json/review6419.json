{"101487":116587,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"DISNEY'S LAST JEDI\\, aka\\, MICKEY STRIKES BACK:If you are a fan of Star Wars lore & the development of main characters traversing a powerful story arc\\, Disney provides epic disappointment.  Rebellious heroics\\, compelling battle scenes\\, Luke\\, Yoda\\, Chewy\\, R2 & C3-PO -all scrapped in this debasing of SW. The foundations of Jedi lore: master\/apprentice traditions\\, humility\\, purpose\\, self development -all are deemed unnecessary. In the new SW one girl possesses all of these traits without having earned even one of them. If you've had enough of compelling real locations\\, riveting light saber fights\\, & memorable side characters\\, then this is your ticket -all these are cast aside as well.  In this new SW universe a few strong women reprimand heroes & lead faceless innocents into obliteration. Devoiding the audience of any care of outcome to characters\\, by having established no connection to us\\, who really cares if they all die?  The few intriguing characters are gone just as soon as we were drawn to them. Snoke\\, powerful Supreme leader\\, easily taken out by an errant saber. Benecio del 'DJ ' exhibiting Han Solo like charisma -all the better to banish him in a few quick scenes.  Luke went to all the trouble of safely projecting himself holographically (note: holographs can't be killed) only to die from the labor of it. Poe\\, the one character exhibiting clear heroic struggle was reduced to submissiveness for all his wrong moves\\, which turned out to be right after all.  i.e. Had he gone in with fighters (which can also carry bombs) to attack the main Star Destroyer\\, the rebel cruiser could have escaped without being tracked through hyperspace.\\nInstead we are dragged through the sleepy drama of large ships inching through space. The far superior enemy force is unable to overtake nor flank them -for no reason given (except excruciating plot device).  It was as if we were suddenly transported to the 18th century suspense of a seagoing ship taking 3 days to slowly overtake another ship. This epic chase slogged over an hour of nothingness\\, with no outcome. So let's spare all the details which will be suffered by those who still choose to see this film (code: bring a pillow & eye covers). Yet we still have to get to the burning heart of the 4 questions most people have going into this film.\\n1. What about Luke Skywalker? 2. Who are Rey's parents? 3. Who is Snoke? 4. Will The Last Jedi use the Force Awakens as a springboard to broaden the SW universe?  1. Luke Skywalker\\, the heart of  the SW universe & all that we know him to be\\, is suddenly expendable & debased. The new Luke no longer believes in the force. He is easily bested by a novice. To make matters worse\\, he betrayed is nephew\\, Ben Solo\\, causing the storm (of the present trilogy) to follow.  This means that all the prophecy fulfillment (SW I-VI) of Luke bringing balance to the force\\, which he did with his father\\, is negated. Luke's most powerful trait\\, his belief in Good is also lost. SW VIII invalidates all of the greatest Star Wars' values & achievements by debasing the fundamentals of who Luke Skywalker is. Simply put\\, we should not have bothered to spend the previous 4 decades watching Star Wars & sharing the values in the allegories\\, lore & collections we all so treasure.  It all means diddly now. Luke ends worse than he began.-And Yoda\\, evidently unimpressed that his teachings led Luke to save the galaxy years before\\, pops up for a few seconds to second the notion that it all has to burn.\\nLuke's three final accomplishments were to argue with a teenage girl as if he was still the same teenager we all met on long long ago on Tatooine\\, to lose belief in all that he earned through the Star Wars epics\\, & to die inexplicably as noted above.\\n2. Who are Rey's parents? 'These are not the parents we are looking for\\, move along.' In a quick sentence\\, Kylo Ren invalidates all deeper interest when he reveals that Rey's parents were no-name 'Junkers' who deserted her.  So\\, no mystery to hold onto there. Unless... this is a clumsily written misdirection from a truth that would be deeper\\, & the only logical possibility...In that this epic has no other Force lending fertile couples other than Leia & Han Solo\\, Rey IS Kylo Ren's sister. For now\\, she is not. Her parents were nobodies.\\n3. We finally get to see Snoke in the flesh. He is very impressive with powers not shown before in SW-the ability to mind bridge other force users to his own ends. His origin\\, why he is so powerful\\, his aims & other abilities- never to be known. Before we could develop a better understanding or compelling fear of him\\,  he allowed a carelessly placed lightsaber to be easily used to kill him.\\n4. I went in to the first showing\\, open to the joys of suspended disbelief\\, & with the force of will to like this Star Wars movie irregardless of any incongruities & the occasional Jar Jar. The only problem was\\, by any measure of that far far away galaxy\\, this was not a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
