Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were plenty of chances to take characters in new directions but they played it safe. They y might have something up their sleeve for the next episode because otherwise it will be just as boring. The main villain is killed without using his death to serve the story in any way. Now we are left with an ultimate bad guy who has been beaten by a girl.","true":true}
