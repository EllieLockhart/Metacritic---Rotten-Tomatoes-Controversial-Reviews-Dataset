Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While not a perfect Star Wars film\\, The Last Jedi certainly holds its own in the ever growing list of SW titles. Unfortunately\\, director Rian Johnson was forced (pun intended) into a box with the cliffhanger ending from TFA. What this sequel really needed was time. Time for the characters to grow and change before we meetup with them again. Instead\\, we are left with a film that has all the right elements - but many of which are set far too soon for realistic character development. That being said\\, the film as a whole is still an incredibly solid addition\\, and has left the door wide open for director JJ Abrams' final installment!","true":true}
