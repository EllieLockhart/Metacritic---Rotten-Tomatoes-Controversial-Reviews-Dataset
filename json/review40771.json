Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movias an absolute mess and severe disappointment. I originally saw it on the Sunday night of opening weekend and decided to give it a couple days before I wrote a review or rating. Before the movie came out\\, I was concerned that they'd kill the character Luke Skywalker. What Rian Johnson did was much worse as he demolished everything there was to love about the character. This was a total hack job that was more about clearing out the old for the sake of future movies than it was about making a good Star Wars movie consistent with the original trilogy.","true":true}
