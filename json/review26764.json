Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"OMG!  What a dumpster fire of a movie!  Ridiculous plot. Vapid dialogue.  Misplaced humor. Poor character development. No resolution to origin of Snoke and origin of Rey. Creates new Jedi powers. Worst of all\\, the movie marginalizes one of the greatest characters in cinematic history - Luke Skywalker.  Felt like a a Micheal Bay movie.  The top critics should be ashamed of themselves for their reviews.","true":true}
