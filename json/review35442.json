Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi delivers. What it lacks in pacing and overcrowded storylines\\, it more than makes up for it with its emotional gravitas and moments of pure badassery\\, a combo little seen in the Star Wars saga since Empire. Rian Johnson and co. take enough risks and go to enough new places to make this truly feel like a worthy addition to the saga.","true":true}
