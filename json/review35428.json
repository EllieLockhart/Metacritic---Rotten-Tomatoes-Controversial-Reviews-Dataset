Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi contains some flaws here and there but it's still great Star Wars. I don't get the overreaction from some fans but really the movie was excellent in  many ways. Lots of high gravity situations\\, twists etc.. The sort of things that were totally missing from the prequels. The criticism is largely emotional and way overblown. \\n\\nThis movie is definitely best seen on a large screen like an IMAX as there are a lot of wide sweeping cinematic scenes worth seeing. The acting was great and the Carrie Fischer scenes had a lot of extra gravity knowing that she passed away.","true":true}
