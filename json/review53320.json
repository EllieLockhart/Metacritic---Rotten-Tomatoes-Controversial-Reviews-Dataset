Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Created account just so I could write this.  It's funny how Disney was complaining about how all the negative reviews were put out there by bots.  I think the opposite is true:  The paid reviewers' high aggregate score\\, and the audience reviewers who leave a 5-star mark with zero to little explanation are testament to that.\\n\\nI don't think I have ever watched a sequel that managed to\\, in addition to being a poor movie on its own\\, actually ruin its predecessor for me.  Furthermore\\, it leaves me with no interest in seeing how it all ends in a couple years.\\n\\nThe first time I watched TFA\\, I couldn't enjoy it because I was too busy waiting for it to start sucking.  Though not the greatest movie\\, I was actually able to enjoy subsequent viewing\\, and was really looking forward to seeing how all the hints and mysteries were going to turn out in the next episode.  Questions asked by TFA (that\\, frankly\\, needed to be answered\\, or else too many things in TFA would not make any sense) would be explained\\n\\nWell\\, turns out\\, nope.  As others have mentioned\\, by the end of TLJ\\, all the main characters are pretty much in the same state of development as they were at the beginning.  That is\\, unless they were killed off meaninglessly\\, utterly wasted\\, and\/or acted contrary to their character (with no explanation).  The questions left open by TFA were answered by a loud \\\"Who cares?\\\"\\n\\nI think the boondoggle to the casino planet is actually a good representation of the whole movie's plot-line.  Just as\\, by the time it's revealed the entire journey there and back served no purpose\\, you realize that\\, at the end of the movie\\, the Resistance is in the exact same predicament as they were in when it started\\, minus a few characters.\\n\\nGee\\, I wonder what is going to happen in Ep 9???  Maybe the transmissions to the outer rim planets were actually received.  Characters we never heard of before\/care about (ok\\, maybe there will be Lando) will rush in and save the day.\\n\\nNot even remotely interested in seeing what happens next.  Quite a bit of potential from TFA\\, and with this\\, totally squandered.","true":true}
