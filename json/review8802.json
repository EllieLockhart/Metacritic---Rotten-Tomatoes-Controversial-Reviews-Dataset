Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Forget the bad reviews. Watch Episode 1-3 and then watch this. Huge difference in quality compared to Lucas' last 3 installments\\, which were umm... hate to say it garbage. Both Rian Johnson and JJ Abrams showed the genius that George Lucas had in Episode 4 & 5. George even admitted loving this movie...I would even bet that he had a tad of envy. ","true":true}
