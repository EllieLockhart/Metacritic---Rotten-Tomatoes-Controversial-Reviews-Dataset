Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's Hilarious how Disney is paying a team to upvote this piece of crap movie. john wayne playing genghis kahn was a better film. you are pathetic disney and the fact that you are supporting this desperate crap even now is pretty funny. goodbye kennedy and goodbye johnson . worthless trash.","true":true}
