Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Flabby\\, with a entirely pointless subplot. Star Wars fans note that they also screw around with what the Force is and isn't capable of doing. The Leia 'Mary Poppins' scene was one of the worst things I've ever seen in sci-fi\\, never mind Star Wars. \\n\\nI was absolutely underwhelmed overall - Force Awakens was a much\\, much better film than this.","true":true}
