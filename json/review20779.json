{"101487":146296,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to like this movie.  I really did.  I was born the year Episode IV came out\\, so Star Wars has always been a huge part of my life.  I even liked the prequels\\, an unpopular stance.  I'm trying to keep this spoiler-lite.\\n\\nVisually\\, this movie is breathtaking.  The effects are fantastic\\, and I give top marks for it. The character of Kylo Ren was fleshed out surprisingly well\\, and we learn a little bit more of his background\\, and why he's the way he is.  He's still that moody emo kid in black\\, but I thought Driver did a good job as the internally conflicted Vader-wannabe.  But that's about where my praise ends.\\n\\nThe story apparently picks up immediately after the events of The Force Awakens- right at the start they make a point of showing that both Finn and Kylo are recovering from the injuries suffered at the climax of that mess.  Yet the opening crawl informs us that in that short time- despite getting their butts royally kicked at the end of TFA- the First Order has successfully conquered the entire galaxy.  SAY WHAT?!?\\n\\nThe rest of the cast doesn't develop at all\\, really.  I didn't give two craps about what happened to Rey\\, or Rose the new girl\\, or Finn\\, and at one point when Finn is dangerous situation\\, part of me really wanted him to bite it.  Sad as it is to say\\, I didn't even like how Luke was portrayed for most of the film\\, although I don't hold Hamill to blame for it.  \\n\\nThe movie has three main arcs\\, and two of them are pretty much pointless\\, just time fillers to get us to the climax.  The one that isn't pointless is basically Speed 2\\, but in space.  Characters do things that don't make any sense.  Leia's got this super secret plan to save the Resistance but inexplicably refuses to share it with anyone\\, so other characters come up with a senseless plan of their own\\, which leads to one of the pointless arcs.  As seen in in TFA\\, Luke is in exile on a nice island\\, but the reason he gives for where he is makes absolutely no sense and it's a little maddening; and then he proceeds to act like a pouty child for most of his story arc\\, rather than the venerated Jedi Master he's supposed to be.  I get that he feels guilty about failing with Kylo; but this is ridiculous.\\n\\nJJ Abrams didn't make this one\\, but his \\\"mystery boxes\\\" are still on full display- you get lots of weird new events and characters\\, but they're never explained\\, but they're important\\, just trust us.  Presumably they'll be explained in some comic book or cartoon but\\, well\\, I have no interest in digging into that morass.  We never get any background on the First Order and its sudden success; same for Snoke\\, Phasma\\, or Hux.  The Knights of Ren never make an appearance.  Just more questions\\, and more characters we're apparently supposed to know but if you don't religiously follow the comics\/novels\/cartoons\/etc\\, you have no idea who they are.\\n\\nI'm fine with some of the major changes they made to the series- I even expected some of them when I learned a sequel trilogy was being made.  Obviously\\, if it's taking place 30 years after ROTJ\\, the plot's going to move past Luke and the gang.  I'm not against change\\, or even the humor- although a lot of it fell flat in my viewing.  A bunch of times\\, things that were obviously meant to be funny\\, the theater remained pretty silent.  Change is fine if it's going somewhere. \\n\\nBut the story is just dull.  Actually\\, there really isn't a story.  And in the end\\, not much has changed.  It's basically a 2.5 hour epilogue to TFA.  Say what you will about the prequels and originals\\, but they at least each had their own coherent\\, self-contained plot that contributed to the greater story- the rise\\, fall\\, and redemption of Anakin Skywalker.  These sequel movies\\, however\\, just kind of meander and it's unclear where they're heading\\, what the point is\\, and how they tie into the greater Star Wars story.  I guess it's that they're passing the torch from Luke\\, Leia\\, and Han to this new generation of characters- but I just don't give a crap about these new characters. \\n\\nI give it two stars because the visuals really were fantastic.  I did like Driver's portrayal of Kylo.  If you're a lifelong fan of the mythology of Star Wars\\, prepare to be disappointed.  If you're a casual fan who doesn't mind a weak story if it's accompanied by lots of explosions and lasers\\, then you're in luck.","true":true}
