Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The filter of fond\\, young memories is likely a harsh lens through which to rate a movie. Nothing will ever match my awe in watching AT-ATs lumber across the frozen hills of Hoth for the first time\\, so many years ago. I enjoyed many parts of this movie. Others\\, not so much. My personal hated be bit was Luke and the lightsaber. When you see it\\, you will know. I could write much here\\, but will leave it short. There are better SW films. And there are much worse. I still enjoy this universe and will continue to see what the next auteur brings to the screen. ","true":true}
