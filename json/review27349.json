Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Originally I gave this movie 2 1\/2 stars but after spending almost a week chewing on it and finally giving it a second viewing I take my original review back.\\n\\nThe first time around I found this movie overwhelming. I had built up expectations of how characters were supposed to be like and had taken the movie at only face value. I was surprised over and over by what was presented\\, things that had gone completely against my expectations going in the first time. And it was jarring.\\n\\nBut upon second viewing I realized just how deep\\, intelligent and how multi-layered everything was in this movie from dialog\\, theme\\, to the emotions expressed by the actors to even how the sets were presented to the audience. And even Luke Skywalker\\, who i originally thought was out of character\\, was actually more in character than i could have realized at first glance. And for that I have to applaud Rian Johnson for his work.\\n\\nI now look forward to his stand alone trilogy in the future.\\n\\nThis is\\, perhaps\\, the greatest star wars film to date.","true":true}
