{"101487":180747,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This entire movie is basically a marvel movie\\, but better. A terrible plot line and subpar script writing are concealed by amazing performances\\, brilliant action\\, and excessive humor \\nZombie Leia was a really bad plot choice\\, she should have absolutely died in the laser cannon blast\\, or being in the vacuum of space (and also not having oxygen)  \\nThe way they used\/didn't use Chewy\\, C3PO and R2 was really sad\\, if you're going to keep main characters alive at least have them be a part of the movie. R2 was only used for a cheap callback to Ep 4. They lean on these characters for nostalgia only\\nSnoke was the biggest waste of a Sith ever\\, and had no purpose. He basically wore the gold jacket from Leprechauns\\, then died as if Rian Johnson just wanted to undo everything JJ Abrams had set up in Ep 7.\\nWhy did the pink haired chick not just tell Poe her plan?? They offered no reason to hold that very simple escape plan back from Poe\\nCalling up Maz was really forced because Poe didn't know her and Fin only met her for like 5 seconds in the last movie. \\nRose is the worst character in any Star Wars... and then she forcibly kisses Fin so she's part of the main story line now and she also sucks as an actor. \\nthe comedy relief was great but often very poorly timed in my opinion. Star Wars always has an air of seriousness to it. Even though there's humor (R2\\, 3PO\\, Han\\, Jar Jar\\, battle droids\\, etc) its always within a serious universe. When Poe was pretending to not hear the New Order officer\\, and the officer acted like he had an IQ of 2\\, I felt like I was watching Guardians of the Galaxy \\nRian Johnson basically does away with the laws of the Star Wars universe. We have no idea why Rey is even fighting with the Resistance\\, she just happens to be in the middle of it. Also she has had zero training\\, something so important to all Star Wars movies\\, and yet can battle Kylo Ren and kill off a bunch of Praetorian guards. \\nFin's character developed 0% \\nThe entire casino subplot also suuuuuuucked. Mostly because Rose was in it\\, AKA the worst Star Wars character that has ever existed.\\n the part when Rey went into the dark side hole in the ground was disappointing\\nthis movie was meant to simply move the plot along. The only thing that happened was that Snoke had a lame death and Luke evaporated. It's like a James Bond film in that nothing really changed from beginning to end. Even still\\, they managed to kill off every interesting cliffhanger from Ep 7\\nGeneral Hux was an intimidating figure in Ep 7. He is the butt end of every joke in this movie and made it look like an idiot even though he's the highest ranking New Order officer\\nFin's character became less developed in this movie. I hated the choice to keep Rose and Fin alive at the end. Just like Super Zombie Leia\\, it seemed like a cheap escape \\nwith the force kid at the end\\, it seems like Disney is more concerned about turning Star Wars into a zombie franchise then telling a compelling story  \\nthere's no romance\\, no punch-in-the-gut moment\\, no climax\\, no emotion \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the bright side\\, this was probably the most aesthetically pleasing Star Wars movie. Kylo\\, Rey\\, Leia\\, Luke\\, and Poe all did phenomenal jobs acting\\, and the Rey\/Kylo battle against the praetorian guard was amazing. Rey and Kylo's subplots played out beautifully\\, and hopefully Kylo stays evil and doesn't become a carbon copy of Darth Vader. Benicio Del Toro's character was great. This movie had some of the best moments of any Star Wars ever\\, but they were scattered throughout a really bad Star Wars movie","true":true}
