Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily the worst of all of the movies. Rian Johnson just basically ignored all of the storylines set up in the previous movie\\, the force awakens.  There's a decent movie buried in there somewhere under the bad execution\\, Spaceballs level comedy\\, and pointless casino arc. I watched it twice\\, both in imax\\, and even imax couldn't make it any more enjoyable like it can do for other films.  It's obvious Kathleen Kennedy is unfit to run lucasfilm and needs to be replaced asap. Compare what she's done with Kevin Feige and the brilliance of the marvel cinematic universe.  That's the difference between someone who knows what they're doing\\, and it shows as every marvel movie gets better and better\\,  while star wars is struggling in every department and that starts at the top with Kennedy.  Replace her now while the franchise can still be salvaged with episode 9.","true":true}
