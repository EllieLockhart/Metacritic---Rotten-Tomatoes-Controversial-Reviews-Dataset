Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cinematic if nothing else. Sometimes tedious and it felt its length. Like they smooshed the original trilogy into one movie. Too much fan service\\, again. It was exciting and boring\\, good and bad\\, emotional and depth of cardboard\\, campy serious and funny. Meh it was fine. Star Wars is a hamster wheel; someone please kill that hamster once and for all.","true":true}
