Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know what I am more insulted by\\, this crapfest of a movie that Disney thought would suffice or Rotten Tomatoes holding the audience score for said crapfest at 50% when anyone can clearly see it should be much lower.\\n\\nBoth should be ashamed of themselves.
