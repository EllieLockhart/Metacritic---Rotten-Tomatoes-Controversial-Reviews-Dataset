Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By far the worst Star Wars yet. This is less of a story and more of a piece of social justice propaganda. Any true fan of Star Wars will be disappointed with nearly every second of this.They even managed to make the light saber battles look awful.","true":true}
