Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually fantastic. The story\\, lot\\, handling of the characters an abomination. If he were real\\, I would hire the Punisher to hunt down the director\\, producers\\, and writers of this disappointment. Truly hurt by this. Shame on Rian Johnson. JJ Abrams\\, and Kathleen Kennedy for this.","true":true}
