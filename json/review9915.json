Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great effects\\, and full of emotional moments. Sadly\\, this don't distracts me from the plot. All the options opened by TFA are completely shut down. I felt the film spit on me\\, and my experience as a Star Wars since my childhood. I recommend seeing this once\\, just to witness how a good saga dies. I will not watch episode 9\\, nor the new saga if this is its future.","true":true}
