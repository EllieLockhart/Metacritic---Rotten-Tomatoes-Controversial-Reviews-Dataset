Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really disappointed in this movie. Ridiculous poorly contrived scenarios like the starship chase that lasted most of the movie. Hokey action sequences like Leia's floating nun maneuver after being blasted into the vacuum of space.  Rey achieving masters level force and saber skills despite virtually no training. It just seemed to make a trivial mockery of the fundamentals that made Star Wars great. I for one will be really glad to see production move away from this original Skywalker storyline. Rogue One has easily been the best film Disney has produced thus far\\, really capturing the essence of the original films while also delivering something original. More of that please.","true":true}
