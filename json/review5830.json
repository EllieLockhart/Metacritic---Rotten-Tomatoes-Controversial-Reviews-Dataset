Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointed that Luke is portrayed as being so disenchanted.   Too many goofy scenes in an attempt to be funny.   Too many plot twists that don't add to the story.","true":true}
