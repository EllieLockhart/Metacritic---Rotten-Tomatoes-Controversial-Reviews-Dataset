Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Finally got to see this much talked about film. I was 12 when I saw the first film so having grown up with the story I am probably as qualified as any of the 5 star rating \\\"professional \\\"critics or the 1 star rating so called \\\"super fans\\\". Much as I expected for me it was neither the classic nor was it the Disney ravaged turkey. Aside from being half an hour too long and littered with some annoying slap-stick comedy it deserved the price of the ticket. Can it survive in the future? I am not sure because for me the current characters lack the charisma of a Han Solo\\, the feistiness of the young Princess Leia\\, or the original evil of Darth Vader. Ho hum\\, that's age for you.","true":true}
