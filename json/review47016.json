Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a disappointment! In my oppinion the worst Star Wars movie since Episode II... maybe even worse. Nonsense story arcs\\, way to long\\, the most interessting characters die\\, others are totaly wasted. Disney is obviously more interessted in selling toys than creating a heroic successor to Episode III - IV.","true":true}
