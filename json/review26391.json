Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not what I was expecting. Got tickets to Wednesday  for me and a few friends. No one liked the movie\\, the cramped plot\\, the butchering of what makes Star Wars magic.\\n\\nThe movie starts with you realizing that the antagonists of the series have been reduced to a joke. Not \\\"marvel\\\" joke but a real one. Why is that?\\nCharacter progression is next to nonexistent with one glaring exception: Luke. He was twisted and turned until he became something you don't expect. You don't believe. \\n\\nForced subplots that serve no purpose but to take screen time. Buildups that lead to nothing Nonsensical romantic plot\\, two characters that spend TFA together just drift apart.\\n\\nThis movie is a mess and made a mess of the Star Wars name. \\nMr. Lucas\\, I forgive you for the prequels. \\nAnd Mark\\, we're with you.","true":true}
