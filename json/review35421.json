{"101487":174964,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi completely bummed me out and ruined my weekend! After JJ's amazing resurrection of the classic space opera\\, (and the terrific Rogue One) the latest effort borders on unwatchable. I created an account just so I can help add to the Audience consensus.  This was awful.\\nThe overwhelming negative reviews (56% at this moment) have said it already: Too long\\, wonky plotlines\\, characters you don't care about\\, corny humor\\, etc. \\n\\nThings that made me absolutely cringe:\\n- Poe doing \\\"your mother\\\" jokes (and this was an early\\, early sign that something was rotten in Denmark)\\n- Leia's Mary Poppins stay of execution\\n- That dumb casino planet\\n- ^ and the precocious kids who cleaned the stables\\n- the longest\\, slowest most boring space chase\\n- Snoke's quick death.  We hardly knew ye?\\n- Any new \\\"cute\\\" creatures\\n- the one dimensional portrayal of the Empire. A bunch of idiots that are somehow ruling the galaxy.\\nMark Hammil didn't really seem to be acting\\, he genuinely seemed like he was reluctant to be part of this mess.\\nWhat baffles and frustrates me is the critic love for this awful installment.  What gives? It's gotta be the modern form of payola or something. Why such glowing reviews for a crummy film?\\nThe litmus test for me is being excited to buy a film's BluRay and watch it at home.  In the case of The Last Jedi\\, if I never see this again\\, I'll be fine. I hate you Rian Johnson...you crummied up something a vast majority of Star Wars fans hold dear to our hearts.  And I get it...it's \\\"edgy\\\" to break the rules and go against tradition\\, but in this case it just didn't work for me.","true":true}
