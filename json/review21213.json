Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I watched the movie a week ago to allow myself to sit back and think about what I truly thought about the movie before posting.\\nWhile the second half made for a pretty good show\\, there were quite a few things that made this not a very good Star Wars movies (fitting into the arc of Star Wars or even the feeling of Star Wars) it was crap.  The first half had several problems with it: 1- a weak plot driving it ran out of fuel and couldn't get hit just to have something take up half of the movie. 2- the dragging on of when Rey was with Luke \\\"texting\\\" Kylo (which I'm not opposed to add new concepts to Star Wars\\, it simply the way it was handled) and how everything that happened on the island went nowhere\\, just to take up time. 3- killing off or ruining everything and everyone that was set up that people were curious to learn about or see them do something\\, before they even get the chance to (Snork\\, Cap Plasma\\, etc...). I'm not against them being killed off\\, rather im disappointed that we as an audience didn't get the opportunity to see them really do anything.  It just felt like everything that was previously set up was just tossed into the trash just because it's not what anyone was expecting or cause it'll be \\\"new\\\" or \\\"fresh.\\\"","true":true}
