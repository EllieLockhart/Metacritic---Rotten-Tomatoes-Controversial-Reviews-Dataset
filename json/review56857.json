Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is a thin line between genius and stupidity. I feel we cross this line several times during the movie\\, which ends up being rather confusing. \\nI enjoyed following the inner turmoil of Luke\\, but the answers he has found (\\\"the Jedi must end\\\") could have made him wiser. He looks instead as a grumpy old hermit full of regrets\\, stuck in the past\\, and not that wise. Very disappointing portraying of this character. \\nThe island of Ahch-To\\, home of the first Jedi temple\\, would have benefitted greatly from a more respectful treatment (this breast milking scene and the appearance of the toad guardians is so disappointing). \\nThe plots are deliberately simple which could favor a younger audience (this slow-motion space chasing and side step sneaking excursion feel very na\u00efve).  \\nSome messages are borderline dangerous and confusing for future generations: Rey uses the dark side\\, luke says she went \\\"straight for it\\\" and she adds up she is \\\"not even afraid\\\". One thing is stating that light and dark need each other's\\, that a balance naturally exists\\, another thing is to suggest both light and dark are \\\"worthy paths\\\" with no consequences or morality (the code breaker thoughts). The lines are purposefully blurred during the movie. Beware the massive deception introduced by those new ideas.\\nThis is to me the greatest danger to the Star Wars universe. Hopefully they will manage to convey that the secret of the force is not about acquiring powers (lifting stones\\, etc...)\\, but about wisdom. This was not successful in The Last Jedi\\, and in fact\\, ended up being contrary to the Star wars identity and essence we had known until now.","true":true}
