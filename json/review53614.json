Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Finn: \\\"They are tracking us through hyperspace? Impossible!\\\"\\n\\nAlso Finn: \\\"I know where the hyperspace tracker is\\, I was a janitor on this ship.\\\"\\n\\nThis and many more inconsistencies make this movie an absolute mess. Why does Snoke release Rey's handcuffs when Kylo is only supposed to kill her? The Emperor wanted Luke and Vader to fight at least...\\n\\nI am just... reaaally tired of listing up all of these things every time somebody says ITS STAR WARS HOW CAN YOU HATE IT ITS ART.\\nIt's not. It's awful and I am done with it.\\nEpisode IX can count me out.\\n\\nThe inhumanity of the characters. The lack of grief\\, mourning\\, reflection\\, compassion. The character reversals. The unclear and shifting motivations of people like Finn. The absurd power growth from Rey. The awkward dialog and relationship with Luke. The surprise introduction of tracking technology and Holdo-technology from nowhere...\\n\\nYeah\\, the worst argument for shitty art is\\, \\\"but\\, it's for KIDS!\\\"\\n\\nThere are lots of great kid's books\\, films\\, etc. that are well-written and enjoyable. The only excuse for shitty storytelling is intentional schlock. Anything else is just plain incompetence.","true":true}
