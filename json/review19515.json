Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It subverts expectations\\, defies normal ideas for the Star Wars universe\\, and is an exhilarating ride from start to finish.  A lot of die hard Star Wars fans seem to be mad that this movie challenges all 7 that came before it\\, but not this particular fan.","true":true}
