Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed this movie so much that it took me almost a week to consider all of my favorite moments so that I could narrow it down to one. And I'm still not there yet\\, so I'm going to give you two: Chewie almost eating a porg in front of other porgs and any time that Benicio Del Toro's character stuttered!","true":true}
