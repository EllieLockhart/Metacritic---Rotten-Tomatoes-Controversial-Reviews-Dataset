Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm pretty sure the writers never saw the last movie\\, plot holes in every minute of the movie\\, the whole movie was bland and completely ruined luke skywalker im willing to give Disney money if they would come out and announce the movie was non-canon. nearly 30+ plot holes pure disgrace","true":true}
