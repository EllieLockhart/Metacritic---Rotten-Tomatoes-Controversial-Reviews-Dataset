Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At 2.5hrs runtime\\, #StarWarsTheLastJedi feels too long even for lifetime fan like myself\\, yet so many questions still unanswered. The rebel vs evil storyline is getting old. Too much space combat. Not enough lightsaber duels (3.5\/5Scales)","true":true}
