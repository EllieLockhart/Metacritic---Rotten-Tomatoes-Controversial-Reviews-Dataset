Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I watched this movie a week ago and have been pissed since I\u2019ve watched it. There are so many holes in this movie. Nothing is explained. Luke Skywalker is a great Jedi and they crap on him and kill him off. He was a grumpy hateful old man the entire movie only to have him killed off. I hate this movie! The only reason I gave it a half star was because of the special effects. And even then it was subpar. ","true":true}
