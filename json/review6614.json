Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Do not let the Fan Boys ruin this movie for you.  See it for your self.  I have seen this twice now\\, once on opening day and again on boxing day.  I enjoyed it better the second time.  This film is being nitpicked on insignificant details\\, when in reality they do not agree with Luke Skywalker's character ark.  Overall the is one of the best action films of 2017.  Good action\\, great plot twists\\, and one of the best 3rd acts in Star Wars history.  The movie loses a bit of momentum in the 2nd act\\, but over all a great film.  If you got to see this film\\, leave any preconceptions at the door and enjoy this movie with an open mind as this movie really will not go the way you think.","true":true}
