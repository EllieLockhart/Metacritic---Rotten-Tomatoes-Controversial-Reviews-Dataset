Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is pandering trash.  I was unable to suspend disbelief with major plot holes every five minutes\\, fake emotions\\, and poor writing.  It didn't feel real.  It is the opposite sort of movie to Rogue One\\, which made the Star Wars universe feel like a real place.","true":true}
