Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The 2 stars are exclusively for the stunning visuals in this empty\\, mediocre scripted movie\\, there are no political tactics\\, no war tactics other than : blast them again! Or we have to sneak into imperial ship and turn off something!! My 6 year old daughter could have come up with a better plot. Its mind boggling that someone got paid millions to come up with a story line that consists of running away from the bad guys\\, getting caught and then escaping again\\, that's it!! I just gave you the whole plot right there and on the process\\, the rebellion seems utterly incompetent losing so many members and the most reckless way while the remaining ones just seem to shrug theire shoulders and move on showing no regard for living beings\\, kinda makes you wanna cheer for the bad guys! Absolutely disgusting!","true":true}
