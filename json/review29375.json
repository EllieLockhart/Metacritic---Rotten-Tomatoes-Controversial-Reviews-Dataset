Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson did the best he could with what Abrams handed him. The biggest criticisms of the movie come from people who had their own idea of what was going to happen and when they were presented with something original\\, they freaked out. Star Wars Fans : \\\"WAHH TFA is just a New Hope Remake!\\\" Also Star Wars Fans: \\\"WAHH! TLJ is too original!\\\"","true":true}
