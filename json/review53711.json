Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Garbage movie that ruined the movie abrams had set up in the force awakens. Lousy fight choreography was probably the worst in the series. Holdo and rose where shocking characters. Johnson stating that Luke\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM)s path was gonna lead him to where he was in the movie reinforces the idea that Johnson did not take into account the event of the OT. Using hyperspace as a weapon in the 8th film of the sky walker saga has thrown into disarray all scenes with hyperspace in it. The movie was never going to be good when Mark Hamill himself stated that this was not his Luke Skywalker","true":true}
