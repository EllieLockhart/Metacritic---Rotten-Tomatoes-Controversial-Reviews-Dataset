Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film will leave you extremely disappointed if you are a fan of the Star Wars universe. JJ Abraham and George Lucas should be livid at the disgrace Rian Johnson created in TLJ. Rian\\, you had no business writing an directing this film. If there is one positive to take away the visuals are stunning but is hard to overlook with such a poor storyline full of plot holes and disappointing reveals. ","true":true}
