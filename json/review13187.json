Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't think Disney knows how bad they damaged the franchise. For Rian Johnson to say\\, \\\"This isn't Luke's story\\\" should tell you everything: He doesn't know nor does he truly care. The whole Jedi prophecy just amount to Luke is all... He restores order\\, travels\\, gains immense powers\\, and is reduced to a crying hermit? To just be able to rip out the beating heart of what star wars is\\, and then shat on it really gives you an idea of the hubris these people have. The story will unfold now into a terribly predictable plot of Rey+Kylo vs. Snoke with force ghost appearances. It's all so stupid. Disney had a chance to milk the franchise in a slightly different way to appease both long-time star wars fans\\, and new ones to come. Instead they just butcher the story to this point\\, and what to start anew with extremely\\, and I mean EXTREMELY\\, forgettable characters in Poe\\, Rose\\, and Finn. Rey and Kylo to me were interesting\\, but it's going to unfold into a ying\/yang finding balance and \\\"actually fulfill the prophecy of the chose \\\"one\\\" through rey and kylo or some stupid asinine shit to cover the massive plot holes created in TLJ.... So disappointed. Shouldn't have had people come in who really didn't know what the hell they were doing. Making a movie? Sure... Keeping a beloved story alive? Not happening.","true":true}
