This company manipulated their fan base and lied in order to sell copies of their game. They altered trailers to trick us into thinking we we\u2019re going to be playing alongside Joel throughout the game\\, making him look younger. I understand that companies sometimes have trailers that are misleading but not outright lie to their fan base about you playing a character that actually dies in the first three hours of the game. Neil Druckmann also lied to us saying that Ellie will be the only playable character when in fact 50% of the game you are playing Abby. We don\u2019t care that you kill off a beloved character\\, we care HOW you do it. Unfortunately\\, Neil got too into his head thinking he could do no wrong that he drove his beautiful story into the ground.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
