Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love Star Wars movies and I think this is one of my favorite ones\\, but there's a lot of problems with the trilogy. I think it's a bad trilogy because you don't feel a strong connection between the movies\\, but this one is a good movie looking for itself. It makes you feel surprised with a lot of scenes and you feel the emotion from the start to the end\\, that's incredible\\, but I think it's important to have a good trilogy\\, that's why I'm giving 7\/10.","true":true}
