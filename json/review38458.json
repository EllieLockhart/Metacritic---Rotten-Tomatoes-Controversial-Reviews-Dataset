Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars ever made\\, \\nI agree with people want to remade it\\, I can't accept this outrageous to ours beloved saga. The director and Disney should be taken the right away to make another movie so bad like this one.\\nThere are some good ideas on the movie and this is the reason for one star: like save who we love and to restart you need people and not machinery.\\nHave you ever seen a comic star Wars? I didn't because it's not on the character of this saga\\, unfortunately not this one as it's made some scenes look so stupid as came out from scary movie's series.\\nNot good at all","true":true}
