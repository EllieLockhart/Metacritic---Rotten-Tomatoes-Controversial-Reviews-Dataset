Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The story has so many obvious plot holes and missed opportunities and character inconsistencies. Beautiful visuals\\, but unfortunately that's all this movie really has going for it. Why leave a map to Luke if Luke isn't going to help the resistance? Why not share the escape plan with Poe? I find it hard to believe that Luke would read his Nephew's mind in the middle of the night and try to assassinate him (given what we know of his character from the ROTJ and ability to see the good in Vader). Phasma and Snoke died needlessly before we learned more about them or their motives. Rey learns nothing from her journey to the mirror at the bottom of the island--so much missed potential there. The hero's quest is one of the easiest story arks to write and SWTLJ tried to do too much with it and have written themselves into a narrative rut. I'm highly surprised that critics rated this movie so highly; very likely that some were paid off.","true":true}
