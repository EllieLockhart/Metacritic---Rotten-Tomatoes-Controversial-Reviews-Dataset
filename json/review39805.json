Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is another chapter in the same story and it is as if Rian Johnson and Disney have never seen a Star Wars movie before.  First of all if you use light speed to destroy a battle cruiser then there would be no need for the rebel fighters to risk their lives and die fighting when you can just use some droids to fly into any cruiser.  Secondly why would you bring Yoda back to burn down a temple.  A force ghost can appear and talk to people but now they can actually destroy buildings?  Then why do we need jedis and rebels when a force ghost can easily destroy the emperor and darth vader or Snoke.  This is such a major screw up.","true":true}
