Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terribly Awful movie. special effect and image were high standard\\, as we should expect in 2017 w\/ hundreds of millions of dollars spend..... but the story\/ plots& subplots\\, are so badly written\\, so poor\\, so wrong\\, that it erase any good work some have done on this movie... stars wars a disney comedy really??  i feel like this rain johnson and Disny just rape a piece of mine and millions other people childhood\\, and they will make over a billions dollars out of it....what a shame...","true":true}
