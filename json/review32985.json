Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Story sucked. Mostly a cobbling of random things going on that are mushed into a turd at the end.  Read articles that show what should have been in this 2.5 hr waste of time.","true":true}
