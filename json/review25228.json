Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nice visuals\\, the good old starwars music. Though the story is bland and uninterresting for the most part. Ray is still op and the scene with the hyperspace kamikaze broke the whole starwars universe. There's also massive jumps of logic to furthen the story.","true":true}
