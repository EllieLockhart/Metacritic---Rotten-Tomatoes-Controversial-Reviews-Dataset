Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love scifi and wanted this movie to be amazing. Instead\\, the creators strove for mediocrity and that's exactly what we go. Lots of fan service\\, boring (albeit cute) aliens\\, and a lot of bullshit just to set up more movies. \\n\\nIt was a fun watch\\, but there were too many absolutely brain dead moments that soured things. For example: The rebels are running at max speed (can't use FTL travel) and the Empire are hot on their tails. NOBODY fucking notices a moon that the rebels could conveniently escape to. The Empire with all their advanced technology can't detect ships leaving for that moon. The writers\/directors expect us to believe in a galaxy where everyone has FTL\\, laser swords\\, and magic powers nobody can use a fucking telescope. \\n\\nI want to know what happened to the guy that came up BB8. That's the guy who should be writing and directing Star Wars. He came up with a unique idea for a robot that could actually be created today. That man has more ingenuity and insight than all of the writers\/producers\/director on this movie. \\n\\nIf you want to see a good scifi movie that's a sequel of an older film. Go watch Blade Runner 2049 instead.","true":true}
