Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"they took an iconic male lead who was the ultimate optimist and turned him into a bitter weak hermit.  it was also very unreal & impossible how rey(whom i like) could have learned to master the force and LIGHT SABER without any length of training.  i liked some parts of the movie but it was sad to see all the bad choices made which outweighed the good.","true":true}
