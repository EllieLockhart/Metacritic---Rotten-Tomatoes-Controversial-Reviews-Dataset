Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They needed to spend more time developing this.\\nThe environments are bland\\, lacking in mood and don't convey the feeling of a far away world. Because of this it was not very engrossing and had no moments of experiential fusion. There were no mysterious or interesting characters that lead to experience-taking.  The star wars universe was the set for Luke's character \\,the is a movie about the set now and the set isn't very good.The original Star Wars films were dream like and painterly and had an art film feel to it. Past directors also had a robust understanding of mechanics and technology. In this fairy tale in a galaxy far far away\\, there is no galaxy.","true":true}
