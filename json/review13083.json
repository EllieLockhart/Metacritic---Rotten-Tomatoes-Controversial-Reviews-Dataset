Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know what is going on with the critics scores.. Have they even seen the same film?! The casting is terrible\\, Rey's acting is so posh and nice.. there's no edge to her! Finn is like the Universe's most good person.. again very over acted and fake.. I don't understand why Diseny can't make a good film and make money? The graphics and character design are well done\\, and the film looks amazing.. but everything else is garbage.. I wish i had 4 hands so i could give this film 4 thumbs down!","true":true}
