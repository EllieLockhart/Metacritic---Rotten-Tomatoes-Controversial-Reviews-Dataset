Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Constant gotcha moments\\, and total disrespect for both the franchise and the other movies in the trilogy\\, nearly killed off the Star Wars franchise for me.\\n\\nAt least the visuals are well done. So it has that going for it I guess.","true":true}
