Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For me this movie was a huge let down. Super disappointed with how this one turned out. I at least thought we would find out how Rey got her force powers. Who were her parents? Why was she left on planet Jakku by herself? Why is Luke not on par with a Jedi Master when it comes to fighting skills? Why did snoke get taken out so easily when he clearly is one super awesome BAMF who is killed in the lamest way possible? What was the point of Rose? Seriously what was the point of her character? She added nothing to the movie. Same with the stupid PETA animal thing were they released the animals into the wild. That added nothing to the story. This whole movie is a slap in the face to those who love Star Wars. I felt like the whole movie was written by ten year olds trying to enact their own version of episode 8. So don't waste your money on this one. Wait until it comes out on Netflix\\, then watch it and give it a one star review there too.","true":true}
