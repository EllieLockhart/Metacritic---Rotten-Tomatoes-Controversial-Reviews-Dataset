Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely loved this movie. There were a few parts that could have been better\\, but no movie is perfect. I like that this movie cast off the anchors that were the original trilogy plots and did not repeat them\\, while still holding true to the original story.  It currently stands as my favorite one yet.","true":true}
