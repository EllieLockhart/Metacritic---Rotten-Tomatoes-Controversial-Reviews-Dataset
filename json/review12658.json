Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I concur with the majority of the audience and their criticsm. This movie is beyond bad. Its actually a crime.  I believe if you add another episode to the star wars saga you have some kind of responsibility to its legacy and its fanbase. Rian Johnston and the producers have clearly mutilated and vandalized the saga with this junk. The critics who rated this movie that high must have been paid well by Disney or they are completly incompeted.","true":true}
