Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I feel like Disney is trying to force their square peg into my round hole. I'm certain Disney's direction of Star Wars appeals to certain people\\, but what I love about Star Wars is not this movie. This movie is Star Wars by license only.","true":true}
