Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Took everything that was built from the last movie and tossed the ideas in the trash. The whole Rose and Finn connection was dumb and uterally pointless\\, just like the casino situation following it. Why would Holdo hide her plans from the rest of the crew? Nothing would of been lost from it. Unnecessary\\, just caused pointless mutiny. Luke was uterally pointless\\, if he wasn\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM)t in the whole movie nothing would of changed. Killed him for no reason at all. Just so many things wrong","true":true}
