Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was pretty disappointed in this one I must say. I liked how they tried to do something different and get away from the formula after The Force Awakens did that way too much\\, but most of these twists just didn't work for me. There are a few good moments\\, but it feels like such a wasted opportunity.","true":true}
