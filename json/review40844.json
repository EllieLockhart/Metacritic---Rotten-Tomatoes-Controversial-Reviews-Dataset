Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie comes from the heart of a pure fan and a truly talented filmmaker. Rian Johnson has taken the lore of 'Star Wars' and somehow stayed true to it while completely throwing out so much of it. He delivered a film no one could've predicted\\, and believe me\\, everyone tried. He bucked the trend with backstories and threaded messages and themes throughout a 'Star Wars' movie that've never been done before. If you want 'Star Wars' told the same way over and over again and according to your own rules\\, it's best you write your own fan fiction. If you want to see your favorite characters evolve and change (at times unpredictably) in a movie that parallels the best of this saga but never repeats itself then 'The Last Jedi' is for you.","true":true}
