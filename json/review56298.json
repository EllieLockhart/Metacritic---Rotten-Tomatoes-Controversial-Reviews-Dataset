Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars VIII: The Last Jedi was the worst Star Wars movie of all time. The disaster of this film started with JJ Abrams terrible film Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens\\, which is a redo of the original Star Wars (now Star Wars IV: A New Hope). Rian Johnson was forced to continue with a terrible modern take on the original trilogy and somehow found a way to make it worse. The modern humor he adds into the script makes a complete joke out a saga that is largely made of serious scenes that uses sarcasm to add humor when it is needed. The Last Jedi has humor that is blantly trying to be funny and doesn't fit at all with the classic Star Wars Films. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi takes the characters we know and love and turns them into a pathetic joke. Everyone was excited to see how powerful Luke Skywalker would be and were left disappointed after they killed him off in the dumbest way imaginable. Kylo Ren is a pathetic character that has no intimidation factor like that of Darth Vader\\, Darth Maul\\, Count Dooku\\, and Darth Sidius. Everyone was hoping that Rey's parents were going to be characters we knew\\, and it turned out her parents are nobodies\\, which was a huge let down. Supreme Leader Snoke was supposed to be a powerful force that would take incredible power to defeat and he died in a pathetic way like Darth Maul. Finn is just about the worst character ever conceived and played by a terrible actor. We were left with so many plot holes\\, empty backstories\\, and weak recycled plots that it made this storied franchise into an utter joke. \\n\\nAs a true and loyal Star Wars fan\\, that understood George Lucas's vision for Star Wars\\, I demand that JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson are fired as directors for creating a huge buildup to a giant disappointment of a sequel trilogy. George Lucas MUST return and direct Star Wars IX and fix the problems created by the previous directors\\, and save Star Wars from the embarrassment and disgrace that were Star Wars 7 and 8.","true":true}
