Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI 3D-2017(PG-13)-Dec. 16. By:Clem The Movie Guy. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the HIGHLY anticipated eighth installment of the epic saga that began forty years ago. Picking up immediately following the aftermath of The Force Awakens\\, The Last Jedi finds Finn (John Boyega)\\, Poe (Oscar Isaac)\\, General Leia (the late Carrie Fisher)\\, & the rest of the Resistance continuing their battle with Supreme Leader Smoke (Andy Serkis) & the First Order. When the Resistance learns that the First Order is able to track them though hyperspace\\, they are suddenly vulnerable to attack\\, leaving many of the Resistance dead & Leia badly injured. Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern) takes command. Seeing that Admiral Holdo isn\u2019t willing to fight back against the First Order\\, Poe\\, Finn\\, the lovable BB-8 & mechanic Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) form a secret mission to locate a codebreaker (Benicio Del Toro) who can disable the First Order\u2019s tracking device long enough for the resistance to elude them. Meanwhile\\, Ray (Daisy Ridley) along with Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) & R2-D2 have found Master Jedi Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) on the planet of Ahch-To. Still feeling guilty having failed in the Jedi training of his nephew Ben Solo\/Kylo Ren (Adam Driver)\\, Luke initially refuses to aid the Resistance in their battle with the First Order even after being told that his dear friend Han Solo was killed by Kylo. Eventually Luke agrees to teach Ray the ways of the Jedi but as the training progresses\\, Ray begins having telepathic communication with Kylo\\, who endeavors to influence her. Despite Luke\u2019s feeling that there no hope\\, Ray believes that there\u2019s still light in Kylo & she that can turn him against Supreme Leader Smoke. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is written & directed by Rian Johnson\\, who did a decent job of capturing amazing action scenes mixed with humor & awesome special effects throughout the film. Unlike The Force Awakens\\, which was actually a much better film\\, The Last Jedi is visually less vibrant & lacks the emotional depth & heart-pounding intensity of that film. The performances from the cast were good. Despite this installment not being quite as good\\, I still can\u2019t wait for the epic final chapter of this new trilogy which won\u2019t hit theatres till Dec. 20\\, 2019. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is still WORTH SEEING in 2D\\, 3D & IMAX 3D.","true":true}
