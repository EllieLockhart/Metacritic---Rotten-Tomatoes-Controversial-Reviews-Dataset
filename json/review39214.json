Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film  deserves a spot in the Guinness World Records book for blockbuster with most plot holes. I'm baffled by the incredibly high score it's getting from critics. How on earth can such an amateurish script get so much praise? Something very fishy's going on here.","true":true}
