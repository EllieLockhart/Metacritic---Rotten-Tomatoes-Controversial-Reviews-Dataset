Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With this new trilogy the big \\\"lesson\\\" is that none of the lore matters\\, a nobody (that much would make sense)\\, with no clue of what is doing\\, can become a powerful Jedi out of nowhere\\, no training\\, no mentor\\, no nothing\\, and that's about it\\, seriously? For the sake of \\\"originality\\\" they managed to crush an entire mythology with one swift stroke. Our beloved heroes from the original trilogy are disrespected\\, reduced to a sketchy caricature\\, killed off mercilessly\\, with plenty of plot holes\\, pointless story-lines\\, unnecessary characters\\, multiple (FU) gotcha moments in the face of fans\\, deceiving the audience with glittery flashy nonsense. Because it turns out that even powerful characters like Snoke do no matter after all\\, and can be wiped out very easily.\\nGeorge Lucas had a vision of hope and balance. All the glory\\, all the legendary myths\\, all the values\\, all the epicness\\, sadly is all lost with this new Star Wars movies. It makes you wonder why... The intention with the diversity was good\\, but on top of all the criticisms\\, I just had the weirdest realization ever. Every main male character in this movie is either ditched\\, proved wrong or made look like a fool by a female character. Luke and Kylo are proved wrong\\, ditched and made look like fools by Rey. Poe is proved wrong\\, made look like a fool and ditched by Admiral Holdo\\, Finn is made look like a fool by Rose. Interesting recurring element to say the least...\\nStar Wars was originally a space-opera\\, now has become a messy money making action flick\\, inconsistent\\, hollow\\, heavily political\\, in no way meaningful or memorable. So\\, there you have it\\, an entire mythology violated\\, subverted and destroyed\\, for what? Nothing. I rest my case.","true":true}
