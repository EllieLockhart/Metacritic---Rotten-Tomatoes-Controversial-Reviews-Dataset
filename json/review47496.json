Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What many \\\"fans\\\" are praising as\\, \\\"shaking things up\\\" by Rian Johnson\\, was in reality a complete abandonment and dismemberment of meaningful and beautiful Star Wars storylines and character arcs\\, built over the last 40 years. As far as pure cinema mechanics go in 'The Last Jedi'\\, the film felt sloppy\\, scattered\\, and misdirected. Forced comedy made you feel uncomfortable at times. But\\, some very cool CGI moments were the only (slight) saving grace\\, along with terrific acting by Mark Hamil\\, Daisy Ridley\\, and Adam Driver. \\n\\nAlthough 'The Force Awakens' was far from a perfect movie\\, it provided solid footing\\, and extremely enticing story lines for the TLJ to build upon. Among these were the profound mysteries behind a powerful villain (Snoke)\\, a surprising hero (Rey)\\, a confused 'Sith in training' (Kylo)\\, and a badass band of bad-guys (Knights of Ren). After the conclusion of TFA\\, the next two years leading up to the TLJ were filled with fun and excitement debating and theorizing over these core mysteries. Rian Johnson not only abandoned these plots\\, but completely butchered them. The beauty and fun of Star Wars has always been the immense detail and background of the characters. 'The Last Jedi' had the ultimate chance to leverage this\\, but utterly failed.\\n\\nLuke Skywalker\\, one of the greatest characters in cinema\/ book history\\, was completely betrayed in this movie\\, and made into a useless and boring character. THAT alone\\, was the most disappointing aspect of this movie. Disney has plenty of avenues to \\\"change things up\\\" from the Skywalker story\\, in stand-alone SW films\\, and the future trilogy. Now was not the time or place to do it. True Star Wars fans feel angry and disgusted over this decision. Bravo to Mark Hamil for doing his best. \\n\\nIn a perfect world\\, Disney would scrap this movie\\, and start over. Unfortunately\\, that is impossible\\, and will never happen.   J.J. Abrams really has his work cut our for him\\, if there's any chance in trying to save this trilogy.","true":true}
