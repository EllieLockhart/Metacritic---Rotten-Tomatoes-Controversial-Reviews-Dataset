Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi has created a whole new movie genre: the travesty film. At 152 minutes\\, it is a bloated\\, illogical train wreck of meandering plot lines that lead nowhere and are mostly meaningless. The visual effects were - for the most part - quite well done; but the gaping plot holes are incredibly distracting and laughable. Rian Johnson seems hell-bent on trashing the things that made the Star Wars franchise entertaining and enjoyable\\, and completely runs roughshod over everything that has gone before him. And what is up with the \\\"critics\\\" on this site? 91 percent? Are you kidding me?!? Most of them clearly did not bother to watch the movie before lavishing it with undeserved praise. The only thing worse than watching such a crappy movie is reading delusional critics' disingenuously saccharine positive reviews. To summarize\\, this movie is garbage. Nice going\\, Disney. You just ran a billion dollar movie franchise into the toilet.","true":true}
