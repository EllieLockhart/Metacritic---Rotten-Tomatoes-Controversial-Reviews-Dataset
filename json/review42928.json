Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was spectacularly creative! While I liked the Episode 7 I found at times it was like a remix of A New Hope. The Last Jedi does not have this problem and is not afraid to go into uncharted territory for Star Wars. It was a nonstop series of surprises from beginning to end that left me on the edge of my seat. One thing that was particularly refreshing was that the characters were human\\, which is to say that they all had flaws which helps viewers connect to the story!","true":true}
