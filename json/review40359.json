Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is probably the first Star Wars Movie that I have been thoroughly disappointed with when leaving the theater. Setting aside weighing the film based on its script filled with plot discontinuities and half-baked sub-plots\\, the film fails the most basic cinematic test in being poorly\\, poorly written. The real tragedy isn't that the material written was not creative or lacked uniqueness as both were present overwhelmingly; but that the film lacked consistent direction and purpose.","true":true}
