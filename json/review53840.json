Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"here am I supposed to begin? This movie comes out with a joke and the jokes do not stop from there. It's almost like Rian Johnson has never seen a Star Wars movie. Sure there is humor in all the films but all the humor in this movie is pretty much forced and comes during very serious scenes.\\n\\nThere are no good combat scenes other than the scene with Rey and Kylo. Not even one lightsaber dueling scene in this movie. They have completely thrown aside what Luke represented in the Star Wars Saga. Even if Luke did sense darkness in Kylo Ren he wouldn't have tried killing him in his sleep\\, or even think about doing so. The moral fiber of what Luke represents is lost. If we all recall... Luke is the one who converted Darth Vader to the light again and destroyed the Sith and brought balance to the force. Luke was not portrayed correctly in this film. \\n\\nRian Johnson has thrown so many twists in this movie that a steady plot line is not able to be formed. He kills off all the important characters and we do not learn anything. I have never seen the ultimate villain of a movie (Snoke) be so talked up and considered so powerful then just be thrown aside without any knowledge of who he is\\, how he attains knowledge of the force\\, where he's from\\, what is his relation to Palpatine\\, the sith\\, etc. They chose the wrong director for this movie. The Star Wars saga is lost.","true":true}
