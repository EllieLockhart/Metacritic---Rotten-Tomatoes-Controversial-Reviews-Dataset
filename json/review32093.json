Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers.\\nThis was the make it or break it film. I was willing to look past the Force Awakens if this film gave us what we really wanted. I had no issue with Luke being this grumpy version of himself. I thought it was great. The time speant with Rey's training was one scene of her just sitting down and Luke getting her to meditate. She also goes through this film and just like the Last Film\\, she succeeds at everything. I don't think Disney has the balls to let that character lose a limb. \\nWe finally get to see Snoke. He's beautiful animated and performed by Andy Serkis. He was interesting. Just when you start to see and want more\\, he gets killed off! Wth \\nLuke doesn't do anything in this entire film. The one thing he did was nearly to the ending of twilight. He sat on his island and commuted suicide instead of getting off his ass and being the Luke Skywalker George Lucas always meant him to be.  We will never get to see Luke Skywalker in combat. Nearly 3 decades of waiting to see that and the hopes were shatered in a mere 5 minutes.\\nPositive note: Excellent acting all around. Great sound and visuals. The production quality was phenomenal.\\nBut this is not the Star Wars film we were looking for and I wish Disney kept George Lucas around. He is probably very bitter after watching this enstalment.","true":true}
