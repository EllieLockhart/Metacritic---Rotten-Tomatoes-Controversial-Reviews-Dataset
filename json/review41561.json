Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is fantastic. I love how it took all of our expectations and big moments and discarded them\\, forcing us to reevaluate these characters\\, who they are\\, and how they fit into the Star Wars Universe. Hamil & Fisher are absolutely fantastic\\, giving some of their best performances in their careers. It isn't often you get a movie with strong female characters\\, and strong male characters. My son\\, and my daughter\\, had amazing heroes. The Last Jedi perfectly sets up a darker\\, defeatist tone which sets up the next movie to be an underdog story of hope and victory of the light perfectly. Just as Empire did. I can't recommend this movie highly enough. One of the best movies of 2017\\, and one of the best Star Wars films.","true":true}
