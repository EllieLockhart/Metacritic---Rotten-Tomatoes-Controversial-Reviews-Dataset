I cannot say anything against graphics.

You can sneak around if you want and kill everyone like an assassin or rush in and blast your way through but be careful... you do not have much ammo so look around all the time.\rAnd lastly the story... As we all know there is some big controversy around it. I really enjoyed the story. Of course\\, there are a few things I would change. For example\\, it should be more chronological so that you play with both characters on the same day. But regardless of this story is really cool and surprise you every time. I think that everything that characters did is realistic and true to their characters. 2 hours from the end I was already thinking that it is over but then another part of the story kicked in and I was happily surprised.\rOverall I can only recommend this game. It was a blast playing it and I think it changed my mindset how I am looking at the world. Thanks\\, Naughty Dogs.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
