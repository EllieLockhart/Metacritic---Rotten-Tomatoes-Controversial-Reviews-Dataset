Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Virtually explains nothing and the running time is too long for what the film covers. I had my doubts about this film because the trailer resembled The Empire Strikes Back and luckily that was not the case. The movie DOES have originality in contrast to The Force Awakens. However\\, the methods the director and writer used to create originality is laziness\\, granting no real explanations for the mysteries presented in this film and not addressing any of the ones presented in the previous films. Even if this movie sets up for a colossal\\, grand conclusion to this trilogy with Episode XI blowing everything out of the water and tying loose ends\\, you can still look at this movie and know it was made very sloppy. The jokes were out of place\\, there were politically motivated scenes involving the casino and Finn and Rose as Rebels discussing the intricacies of those who profit from conflict-- war mongers. The jokes were Marvel-esq and were excessive. No Star Wars film has a gag and sex jokes and quips in every damn scene. Captain Phasma is arguably the Boba Fett of this new generation: overhyped and under developed. Snoke was a joke unless they're preparing for something crazy in the next episode. I couldn't help but feel underwhelmed after watching this film and then ultimately admitting to myself that this movie was plainly just shit. ","true":true}
