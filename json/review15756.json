Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie to death\\, but I can't help but say that this movie had a couple of flaws. Some scenes in this movie were unforgettable and amazing\\, especially the action. Other scenes are just flat out bad including one with a new character in the film towards then end.","true":true}
