Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible betrayal of the Lucas legacy. Obvious what disney is doing here. \\nAnyone who has ever cared about these vcharacters will be disappointed. Even Mark Hamill hates it. The Skywalkers are evil and the Empire will never be defeated. Get ready for more movies! \\nThanks for ruining this so completely Rian Johnson. I am boycotting the rest of your films.\\n\\n\\\"Everyone's special is just another way of saying no one is.\\\"","true":true}
