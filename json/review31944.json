Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILER\\nIt's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The script is a joke.\\n1. Read flying in space as a robot GUNDAM\\n2. Luke like crap.\\n3. The whole plot of chase the rebel ships\\n4. Ren without any Jedi training and skillfully using force ...\\n5. Kylo is a lousy character\\, played by a lousy actor.\\n6. The forced attempt to kill the old characters interpreted by the original actors so forcefully just to get past the \\\"stick\\\" was deplorable.\\n\\nBetter stop here ...\\n\\nI want my two and a half hours of life back.\\n\\nWhat was the cost of adapting Trawn's trilogy in the best possible way for a movie?","true":true}
