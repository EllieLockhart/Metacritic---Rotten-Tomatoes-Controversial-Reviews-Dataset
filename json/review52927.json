Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An oddly mixed bag overall.\\nThe film contains some of the best scenes and new elements of all the star wars saga in the interesting relationship between Rey and Kylo\\,  true blurring of the dark and light side\\, and indeed the majority of Kylo's story.\\nAt the same time some of the worst elements are also found here: the shaky writing in both plot (holdo\\, canto bight) and dialogue (ROSE\\, \\\"rebel scum\\\") at times\\, comedy which often overstays its welcome\\, often taking away from the tension of scenes and feeling more akin to a parody than an actual star wars film.\\nMany elements seem wasted such as the blurring of light and dark which\\, whilst a good element\\, could have been explored further\\, and villains such as Snoke\\, Hux and Phasma are all made largely devoid of any small element of character and nuance hinted at within TFA and are incredibly disappointing to see utilised so poorly.\\nOverall\\, the film has some excellent moments and good character building for both Kylo and Rey\\, but sadly is let down by shoddy writing\\, an incongruent tone\\, and a desire to be \\\"subversive\\\" in a way which doesn't fit in with the narrative set by the previous installment.","true":true}
