{"101487":147845,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-02","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Jedi - The Last Star Wars\\n\\nThis movie was bad\\, an utter disgrace for Star Wars.  It literally destroyed a franchise which I held dear since my childhood.  And I'm NOT a bot\\, but I'm using a temporary e-mail because I value privacy and don't want to get mail-spammed in years to come.\\n\\nThe countless flaws of this movie have already been listed here more often than I can remember.  But some points in particular keep coming up\\, so I would like to address them.\\n\\n1. Rian Johnson Said He Is A Long-Time Star Wars Fan Too:\\n\\nI guess this was simply a lie\\, like for example the producers of \\\"Harry Potter\\\" said to press\\, that the person playing the young Voldemort was so frightening that even the cast on the set was afraid of him\\, or that they waited so long to produce a sequel to \\\"Highlander\\\" because they wanted to make sure to have a worthy and fitting story for it.  Such statements are usually not true\\, but solely to make the fan base believe that 'something really great' is coming.\\n\\nApart from that\\, if he truly were a Star Wars fan\\, he would have treated the whole thing with more respect\\, and more heart.  Every God-dang IDIOT can do a reboot by destroying everything that has been established and starting from a 'clean slate'.  Why Disney\\, with all its money\\, hired such a person instead of a true professional\\, is beyond my understanding.\\n\\n\\n2. Negative Reviews Come From Bots:\\n\\nI've read many many comments about \\\"Last Jedi\\\"\\, and generally\\, most positive reviews here only consist of a single line or one short paragraph\\, just saying things like \\\"the movie was great\\\" or \\\"best Star Wars ever\\\"\\, but without going much into detail\\, while the negative reviews lengthy describe all the flaws and give countless examples to validate their point beyond any doubt.  Considering this\\, I would rather say that the POSITIVE comments look like coming from Bots...\\n\\n3. Space Physics:\\n\\nTechnically\\, the whole space physics in Star Wars was 'wrong' since the very beginning\\, but it LOOKED great because it imitated classic dogfight.  So we should not criticize that part.\\n\\n4. Feminism:\\n\\nJust to note\\, men and women should have equal RIGHTS\\, but are NOT equal.  In the Original Trilogy Leia was usually portrayed smarter and more emotional\\, while Han was more the spontaneous act-first-think-later scoundrel\\, and they were seen as 'equals' by the viewers simply because both were competent in what they did\\, and because during their quarrels both could stand their ground\\, and none needed help from Social Justice Warriors.  We definitely do not need in-your-face feminism in Star Wars\\,\\nor men being 'dumbed down' to make women appear more capable.\\n\\n5. Leia In Space:\\n\\nWhen exposed to a vacuum\\, a person can sustain 9-12 seconds until it looses consciousness (and survive for around 60 seconds or so).  So Leia changing her direction while being weightless in space IS logically possible\\, especially because this scene seems to be in slow motion (Luke did the same when falling down after he jumped to get away from Vader in \\\"Empire Strikes Back\\\").  It's just that the scene was executed very amateurish.  Time-critical events should not be interrupted by other\\, pointless scenes\\, or the 'flow of time' feels wrong.  Imagine the movie \\\"2001\\\"\\, the scene where Dave Bowman is blown from his space pod into the emergency airlock of the Discovery without wearing his space helmet.  He has only 10 seconds to reach the handle that closes the outer door and restores atmosphere.  Now imagine that right in the middle\\, there is a needless cut to HAL examining some data readouts for 30 seconds\\, and then cutting back to Dave pulling the handle.  See what I mean?","true":true}
