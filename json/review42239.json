Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie starts off confusing for people that didn't watch the other Star Wars movies. It jumps around\\, and gets confusing at points. Though it does clear up. The movie has a nice approach of tying the original and prequel series\\, and opens up the possibilities of the future. For me\\, it died not clear up my big question going in\\, so I'm not sure how to react. This may be good at some points of view. Overall\\, it is good\\, though it does let down the audience at some points. I liked the huge twist at the end\\, and it is time for theorizing what episode IX will be.","true":true}
