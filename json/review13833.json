Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If the Canto Blight story is there to show that heros can fail\\, then really show them fail and then use that. But they don't learn from it\\, they just go over to another clunky sequence with characters without personality. Add to this shoehorned attempts of humor\\, where it is supposed to be funny that Hux gets bullied into submission by Kylo. That is just bullying.","true":true}
