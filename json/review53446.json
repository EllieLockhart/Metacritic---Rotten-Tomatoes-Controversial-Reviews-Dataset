Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney please read this\\, Star wars fans are creating new accounts to tell you what you have done is wrong\\, my biggest concern is why this film was green lit.\\nIf you don't understand this is more than just a film to hundreds of millions of people you don't deserve the rights to the franchise\\, I will not waste text elaborating issues that's everyone else has raised\\, you have a choice Disney - stay on this track and hope build a new audience of younger viewers while destroying (this word is not used lightly) the 40 years loyal fans of star wars or announce a press release\\, I am sure we are wasting our breath\\, millions of people are heartbroken now because of you.\\nReasons - Luke's wasted and poorly written  death\\, Luke even thinking of killing  his nephew\\, snoke backstory and reason for being completely missing?.  There is no way a Star wars fan made this film no matter what Rian Johnson says. Everything great you have done with avengers has been destroyed by this movie\\, I beg you read the intelligent fan reviews and listen.\\nPs Mark Hamil was Wright and Rian was wrong.","true":true}
