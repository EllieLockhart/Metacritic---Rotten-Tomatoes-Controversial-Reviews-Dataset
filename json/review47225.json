Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a piece of garbage! Glaring plot holes\\, inconsistent character motivations\\, and a blatant disregard for the previous mythos of the Star Wars universe. I can't believe the same critics who bashed the prequels are jumping on the Disney bandwagon and praising this worthless movie.  The Last Jedi makes the prequels look great in comparison\\, I won't be wasting my money and ever seeing another Star Wars movie again.","true":true}
