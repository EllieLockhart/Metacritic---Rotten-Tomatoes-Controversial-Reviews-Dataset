Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the worst Star Wars film ever! So many plot holes. Rey is so perfect? She had a harder life than Luke but turned out this unspoiled perfectly balanced person. I thought rey worked great in the first movie but now? And all this unexplained new force powers? Is this dragon ball? ok this new Jedi is level 135 and has xy powers but Rey is level 398 now and has xyz abilities. And what about that mirror scene? Straight from Harry Potter!!!","true":true}
