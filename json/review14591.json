Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a Star Wars fan my entire life and this film felt like a huge slap in the face. Rian Johnson completely destroys the franchise. He ruins the characters we all know and love\\, then introduces new ones just to kill them off before we actually know anything about them. Disney should be ashamed of itself for disrespecting the franchise in such a heinous way.","true":true}
