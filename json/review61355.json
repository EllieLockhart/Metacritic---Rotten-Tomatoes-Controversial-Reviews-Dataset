The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Waited 7 years for this game\\, thought there was no way ND could make a bad sequel. Holy cow was I wrong. Game starts out pretty solid\\, iffy on Joel dying in the first roughly two hours\\, but whatever. Then we get to play as Abby... I have never cared about any character or subplots less than her\u2019s. We don\u2019t care about her and Owen. We don\u2019t care about the crammed-in war against the Seraphites. We don\u2019t care about any of that. ND somehow found a way to water down the specialness of their own main character in their own game. The whole \u201ctwo sides of the same coin\u201d gimmick just feels tacky and subtle as a sledgehammer. Ellie collects trading cards\\, Abby collects coins. Ellie couldn\u2019t swim\\, Abby can\u2019t be up high in the air. Mel was pregnant\\, so was Dina. You can\u2019t make this stuff up\\, they really thought they were onto something with this. And don\u2019t give me any of that anti lgbt or transphobic stuff\\, Abby being masculine has nothing to do with my critique or mostly anyone\u2019s. Makes the sex scene a little off-putting (yeah you get a good look at her naked in the game) but it\u2019s not a valid reason to dislike her. Her inclusion\\, body type and looks aside\\, is still the main thing that ruins this game. It\u2019s almost as if ND gave us Ellie to focus on and care about and gave us Abby almost like how your mom made you take your younger sibling with you to places as a kid; you\u2019re still having some fun\\, but man did they REALLY have to come too?In conclusion if you\u2019ve read this far- game was good until they shoehorned Abby in there and expected us to like her. Could\u2019ve been a great game but ND dropped the ball.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
