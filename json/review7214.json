Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Entertaining\\, but more so as a stand alone film. It takes the original trilogy and nearly throws it away. It also seemed as if The Force Awakens was a waste of time. It felt like a good movie for very casual Star Wars fans or the type to enjoy anything as long as it's branded with the Star Wars label.  Once again\\, it's entertaining\\, but this movie isn't for those that loved the original trilogy.","true":true}
