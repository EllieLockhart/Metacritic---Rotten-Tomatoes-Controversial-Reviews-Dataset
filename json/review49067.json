Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie ever!  Cannot believe Lucasfilm gave the green light to this piece of garbage.  Not only does it destroy Luke\\, Rian Johnson managed to screw up the new characters.  This movie should have been a Grand Slam with the set up it had but instead it is a turd.","true":true}
