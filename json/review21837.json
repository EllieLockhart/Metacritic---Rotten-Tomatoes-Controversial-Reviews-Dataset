Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just got out of watching this movie and I thought it was great! There's a good balance of comedy and drama throughout and you can feel the emotional weight just as you're laughing at the occasional snarky comment. It makes a lot of interesting choices that leave me intrigued about where the next movie is going to go from here (I won't spoil them) and maybe some things that could be better set up or addressed. The action scenes are pretty spectacular and some are especially jaw-dropping to watch on the big screen. The main characters are still continuing to progress on their respective journeys and I like that there's a bit more nuance than just the \\\"light side\\\" or the \\\"dark side\\\" being displayed here. There's more shades of grey between the light and the dark being discussed which makes our characters and the whole Star Wars universe more complex and fleshed out. It was a pleasure to see and I intend to watch it again soon.","true":true}
