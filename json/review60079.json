We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"First of all\\, for anyone who hated this game deep down of their heart JUST because they read the leak or even worst because their favourite youtuber\/streamer.. well i feel sorry because you cant make your own decision. Actually its 9\/10 for me\\, I hated to play Abby at first especially how they cut Ellie story its just a bummer for me. Slowly i realized how the ND team want to make us seeing a different perspective\\, BUT still they failed to make me more care about Abby. in Abby scenario i played in rush and almost didnt enjoy it. especially how they make Abby stage are more linear than Elly. As a whole this game is not perfect game but i cant stop thinking about this game. i didnt readt about the leak\\, i got the leaked from my friends who pissboff about the LGBT and feminism\\, and i dont care. in the perfect world its not gonna happen anyway\\, also we already had Joel \\\"hero moment\\\" in the first game. ND put a big risk on this gam and Neil already told us it will divide us\\, and it worked! so what make thisbgame so good for me\\, i love how they potrayed Joel and Ellie relationship\\, they are not father and daughter they even cant say how much they love each other.  Gameplay and graphic is one of the best in this generation. This is a great game but i cant recommend it to every person unlike the first one.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
