Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a Star Wars movie like the original once. It has the same flaws the original trilogy hast. The out of the place humor. The pointless plotpoints. A few plotholes. All in all a perfect Star Wars movie. Total enjoyable and darker than any Star Wars movie before. The lines between dark and lightside of the force were never blurry like in this one. The people are only complaining about the Bad stuff but this movie has so much great scenes.","true":true}
