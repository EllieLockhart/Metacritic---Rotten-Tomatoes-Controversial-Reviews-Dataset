Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many lazy decisions in writing that make it seem as if Rian Johnson just had no interest in these pieces of the story\\, so he dumped them in the simplest ways possible in exchange for the story he wanted to capture. This movie was sadly more riddled with plot holes than the car at the end of Bonnie and Clyde and I empathize with JJ for what he has to duct tape back together in the next film. There were so many things that TFA set up and introduced that Johnson just wrote off or left completely unattended to make a movie that was so focused around a different part of the story and this makes it seem as if he never even saw TFA and instead had someone describe what it was about and he worked from there. I was genuinely disappointed. If you want to see a good movie\\, this is that\\, but it simply is not a good Star Wars film\/sequel.","true":true}
