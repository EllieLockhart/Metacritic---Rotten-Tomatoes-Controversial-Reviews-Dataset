Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi isn't without it's flaws but it's still a great film and one of the best entries in the Star Wars franchise and shoots the franchise into a fresher direction rather than relying on it's past like happened in TFA at times.\\n\\nThe story focuses on the fading Resistance being hunted down by The First Order all whilst Rey is on the planet of Ahch-To trying to convince Luke to come to the aid of the Resistance and train her in the ways of the Jedi. Rey is the biggest highlight of the film for me. Whereas in The Force Awakens she just seemed completely uninfluenced by the dark side of the Force despite not having any training. In The Last Jedi\\, the dark side has a great influence on her development and although she doesn't turn\\, it helps her grow as a character. Kylo Ren also has a vastly improved story\\, developing from the whiny bitch of TFA\\, to an angry\\, hate filled leader. Alongside Rey he has some of the best scenes in TLJ and is also part of one of the best battle scenes in Star Wars history. On top of this\\, there is some top notch action\\, including both a brilliant opening sequence and finale.\\n\\nThe biggest problem come with Finn's storyline. It doesn't really add much to the storyline\\, and worst of all\\, add the character of Rose\\, a character who adds absolutely nothing to the film. There doesn't really feel like there is any reason for her to be there and the cynic in me can't help but feel that the only reason for her to exist is to appeal to the Asian market\\, a market that Star Wars has typically found hard to crack. Aside from this\\, my complaints are few and far between but there are some misplaced attempts at humour and there is also a scene with Leia that is embarrassing to watch.\\n\\nAs for the negative fans reaction\\, most of them seem to be for little reason other than the fact that there fan theories (most of which lacked creativity and were quite frankly crap) didn't come to fruition. There are also a large number of people who just can't handle that some of the main characters are women. This is a great film and well worth watching for fans and non-fans a like.","true":true}
