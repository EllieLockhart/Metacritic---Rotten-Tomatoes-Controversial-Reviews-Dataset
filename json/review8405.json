Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Filled with awe-inspiring moments\\, breath taking visuals and a conscious effort to challenge movie\/story conventions. While not a fan of every decision made in this movie\\, I applaud The Last Jedi for pushing the franchise forward and provide so many moments that are on-par with some of the best moments in any movie.","true":true}
