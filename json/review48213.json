Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Whoever wrote this script has zero understanding or desire to understand Star Wars universe and it's peculiarities. What happened with all of the subplots from the previous movie? Where are the knights of Ren? Who was Snoke? \\n\\nLuke Skywalker character was butchered completely. Captain Phasma potential was completely wasted as well.","true":true}
