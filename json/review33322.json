Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Surprised me at every turn\\, which is something SW hasn't done in a long time. Visually stunning\\, well acted all around\\, and perhaps most importantly\\, it challenges - and in many cases\\, slays - the sacred cows that have hobbled the saga films since the prequels. It's difficult to say more without spoiling the film\\, except to say that this is a film which fits the times\\, just as ANH did in the 70s.\\nOf course\\, like all SW films\\, it has plot holes big enough to drive a Star Destroyer through - but again\\, it is hardly unique in that respect. Even the beloved ESB makes little sense if you really scrutinize it. You either accept that and go along for the ride\\, or you don't.","true":true}
