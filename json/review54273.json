Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I give the movie a second star\\, only because there were -some- scenes that were entertaining\\, and there definitely was some exploration potential. \\n\\nThe more I reflect on it\\, it becomes more apparent that the Disney influence is a negative. It takes a corporate approach\\, rather than a story-driven approach. It tries too hard to appear as something it's not: a risky movie. It pretends that Luke's struggles are risky\\, when in fact they are just 180s in character for the sake of 180s. It pretends that having so many women is risky\\, when in fact it did so at the expense of the narrative (Admiral Ackbar's convenient dismissal so we can have a new female admiral\\, as an example). The problem is they are trying -too- hard. They shoehorned far too much into a film\\, that it wound up distracting from the very things I think a lot of fans wanted to see: Luke (either powerful or as a trainer\\, or both); Rey actually struggling so that her character is someone I want to invest time in; Kylo actually having valid reasons to suddenly go from \\\"don't kill Mom\\\" to \\\"murder her and everyone else.\\\"; Finn actually becoming more than a comedy attempt character and doing something meaningful; Phasma actually justifying the Disney marketing department's build up; Hux not being such an obvious buffoon that there is no way he would rise to his rank of an evil new empire; Poe and the Admiral actually acting like normal chain of command\\, and her realizing that simply stating \\\"There is a plan\\, and you are not privy to it due to your recent insubordination that cost us our entire bomber wing.\\\" (This was a real hard one for me\\, as I felt their attempt to create new female leadership was actually ruined by the script. Great opportunity missed to have a female leader who actually inspires her crew).\\n\\nIt just feels like the director was out to be different for different sake\\, without actually committing to a great narrative that plays that out. Add to the fact that Disney obviously is checking too many marks off it's list to ensure it covers its bases... \\n\\nThe movie just isn't great\\, and that's both sad and a problem. The franchise has everything Lucas didn't have at the beginning resource-wise\\, and still manages to do nothing memorable. There are no iconic villains\\, there are no iconic heroes (you'll remember that Empire Strikes back has Luke learning a valuable lesson in overconfidence)\\, and simply leaves me hoping that someone in Disney's staff will have the courage to let the crew make a great story.","true":true}
