Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was entertaining enough as a stand alone film with incredible effects. Unfortunately\\, it obviously is not a stand alone film. The film takes a strange pride in having no connection to the universe as it has been described or to the development of its characters. I laughed out loud at the amount of inconsistencies as they flew by\\, one after another. But after leaving the theater\\, I\u2019ve been left with nothing but the disappointment of a film I cannot logically connect to the saga we all fell in love with. At least non-Star Wars fans got a kick out of it. ","true":true}
