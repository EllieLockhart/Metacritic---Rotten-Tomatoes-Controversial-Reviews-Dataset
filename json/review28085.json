Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot was absolutely horrible. The whole movie was basically two ships chasing each other while a ridiculous side quest saves some alien horses. The characters were good but the jokes were forced. The only saving grace of the film was Luke Skywalker and even he wasn't enough to save the film. I can see how the movie is entertaining in some aspects but the critic reviews are dead wrong. Good thing the next one goes back to Mr. Abrams.","true":true}
