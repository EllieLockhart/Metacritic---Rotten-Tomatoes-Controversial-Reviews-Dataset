Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Say what you want about Star Wars Episode 8 but this is one of the best Star Wars movies ever since the original. I know there are some scenes like the Canto Casino side mission that should have been removed. Not to mention the new characters like Amilyn Holdo were a pain to watch. As for Rose Tico\\, she was ok\\, but she could have been written better for her. The good parts of this movie was the musical score\\, the visual effects\\, Yoda's reappearance\\, and the emotional \\\"death\\\" of Luke Skywalker. Overall\\, The Last Jedi upholds the sequel trilogy into new heights.","true":true}
