Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For the most part this movie is pretty unwatchable\\, it completely disrespects the OT and the characters. Mark Hamill is amazing but the direction they took Luke is a way that the Luke of the OT would have never taken. Hands down is the worst Star Wars movie of the saga.","true":true}
