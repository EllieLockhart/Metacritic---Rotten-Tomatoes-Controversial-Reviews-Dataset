We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"**STORY**TLOU fans loved the bond between Joel and Ellie and that's what many expected to see more in part 2 but instead Naughty Dog (ND) decided to kill the main character brutally. Within the first hour\\, the story lost its purpose and we play the rest of the game heartbroken to explore the crap. It took me a day to get back to the game and finish it.On one side ND injects anger against Abby\\, the person who killed Joel with no mercy\\, and later we play as her. I hated every single moment playing as Abby as she doesn't deserve the screen play. She popped into the game like a random ad.We played the whole game to take the revenge and after all the hassle we let Abby go. Why?! Where is Ellie's big mouth which always disrespected Joel and argued? ND completely ruined the story and I wish there was no part 2 for The Last of Us. The trailers were completely a bait to encourage everybody to buy the game and get themselves disappointed.**ROMANCE**Comming to the back and forth scenes. There was no point of Romantic scenes while the players are eager to kill Abby! I wasn't able to explore the environment\\, kill enemies and infected with the same energy when I played the first part. **GLITCHES AND BUGS**The AI\\, Diana and other followers\\, tend to block my path and sometimes kicks us out of cover. Moreover\\, my character glitched at a point when getting on the boat. I streamed it for 3 minutes on YouTube for the record (Riz_Mub).After waiting for 7 years\\, The Last Of Us fans were stabbed in the back and their emotions were completely ignored. Naughty Dog ruined the story. I regret pre-ordering my game and a special thanks to Anita Sarkaseen for ruining the game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
