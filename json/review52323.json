Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A good movie overall but probably not as good as the force as the force awakens. The cantobight story line was very stupid and it just dragged on at that part. Also\\, too many questions still unanswered from TFA. The movie also has pros. The story with Kylo Ren and Rey was interesting and the action was great. Overall\\, it is a good movie but definitely not as good as the force awakens.","true":true}
