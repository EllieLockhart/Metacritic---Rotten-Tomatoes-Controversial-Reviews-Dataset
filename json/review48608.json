Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worse than the prequels.  A Two and a half hour slow spaceship chase with contrived subplots.  I was actually offended by how awful it was.  Except the opening space battle.  If the credits would have rolled after that\\, 5 stars.  Ugh.  Train wreck.","true":true}
