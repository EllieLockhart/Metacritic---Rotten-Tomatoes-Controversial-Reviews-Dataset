Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst writing and editing\\, ever! Total lack of continuity. Absolute disrespect to established characters. The special effects are sup-bar. This movie is a total waste of time. I can not understand how somebody thought that a director with absolutely no experience in big movies and special effects could handle this. J.J. Abrams should be offended that this guy is put on a level with him.","true":true}
