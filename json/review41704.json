Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is not good. Leia coming back from death was over-the-top for me and that was only about 30 minutes into the movie. Poe didn't have much of a role in the movie other than the first sequence of the movie. His jokes are now kinda annoying. There was NO point for Rey to visit Luke because he didn't train her and Rey already knew who her parents were. Everyone on the Resistance should have all died\\, but didn't to that there would be Star Wars 9. This movie was sooo disappointing. Why introduce Snoke in The Force Awakens only have him easily killed off in The Last Jedi? Pure garbage. Lastly\\, the whole point of Finn's mission was to get the code breaker to stop The First Order from tracking the Resistance fleet. Yet\\, that mission failed. So there was no point to Finn's mission as well.. There is a theme in The Last Jedi.... Rey's mission to get Luke to follower her failed. Finn's mission to disable the tracking device failed.... Poe's mutiny failed... The Last Jedi failed.","true":true}
