Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What can I say? The movie was a pathetic attempt at propagating a promising story that left you with exactly as much information at the end as you had at the beginning.\\n\\nI love Star Wars - I grew up on it. I have a signed photograph of Darth Vader right behind the desk that I'm writing this review on. However\\, apart from being a fan\\, I'm also an open-minded movie-goer\\, so I went into this movie with a clean slate and no preconceptions.\\n\\nThis addition to the epic franchise sucker punches you and doesn't apologize.\\nWhat do I mean by that?\\n\\nWell\\, for starters\\, the movie feels like it's 3 1\/2 hours long and I don't mean that in a good way. I was ready to leave a full 30-45 minutes before the credits rolled. The plot and character development was nonexistent. There was no growth in any character's story and that's a problem.\\n\\nYou see\\, in order to have a true battle between the light and dark side\\, you have to actually have an antagonist that you're willing to believe will stop at nothing to achieve his\/her goal. There is no true sense of urgency or even threat in regards to the main characters (which are wrapped in the world's thickest layer of plot armor I have ever seen). You never get the sense that they are truly in danger; there is no real risk or imminent threat to their survival because the bad guys aren't really that bad.\\n\\nRogue One was great because the empire felt truly\\, convincingly heartless. It made you feel like the Rebellion was truly the underdog. The same goes for the original trilogy. In The Last Jedi\\, the primary antagonist(s) don't seem ruthless\\, they aren't the dark side which we have all come to know and fear\\, the are underdeveloped characters which you are just told are bad.\\n\\nLuke and the Rebellion are terrified of how strong Kylo Ren is\\, but they never show anything to show you why this character (or Snoke) are truly to be feared. The only sample of Kylo Ren's power that you get is a stale standoff between him and Rey that just goes to show how completely pathetic the \\\"head hancho\\\" of The First Order really is.\\n\\nThe movie runs long with scenes that do nothing to add to the film - if only detract from an ever-growing void that starts to build in the pit of your stomach after the first half-hour of the film. \\n\\nThis is by far the worst Star Wars film of the series and a catastrophic disappointment. The writers\\, directors\\, editing team... the whole god-damned Star Wars crew needs a major overhaul.\\n\\nIf this movie is any indication of what we can expect from Star Wars films to come\\, I don't think we'll being seeing a young generation of Jedi and Sith fans uplifting the mantle of the epic saga in the future.","true":true}
