Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When I first saw this film I wasn\u2019t sure what to think. It didn\u2019t feel like Star Wars and I wanted more of Luke in the film... but I saw it a second time and the experience I had was amazing! It made me feel like a kid again! It was Star Wars! It was epic it was thrilling! The force is strong with this one! ","true":true}
