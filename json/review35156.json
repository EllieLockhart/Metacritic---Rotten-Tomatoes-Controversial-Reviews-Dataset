Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force Awakens wasn't perfect\\, but it was enjoyable and it made me excited for the next film. The Last Jedi was a slap in the face. I don't find myself looking forward to Ep9 other than to hopefully wash the bad taste out of my mouth.","true":true}
