Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has more plot holes than any movie I\u2019ve ever seen. Pointless and unbelievable premise\\, lack of any real movement forward with the Star Wars saga\\, and honestly\\, I\u2019m just left with constantly saying\\, \u201cwhy did they do that?\u201d You May enjoy if you are not a Star Wars fan\\, if you are a die hard\\, I think you will feel that this if far from the best Star Wars since Empire\\, like I\u2019ve been reading\\, and more like the worst Star Wars since Phantom Menace.
