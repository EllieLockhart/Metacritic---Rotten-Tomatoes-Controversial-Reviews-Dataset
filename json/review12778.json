Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Identity politics and social justice arrive in the galaxy far far away. \\nI don't hate this movie just because the political agenda is corrupt and evil. I hate this movie because it's a terrible film.\\nHorrible script\\, painful pacing\\, terrible characters\\, inconsequential subplots\\, wretched cringe-worthy humor\\, and disrespectful treatment of beloved established characters.\\nNow\\, I could potentially forgive all of that if it were not for one final element; this movie is boring. By the end of the film I felt as if I had sat through a marathon of the worst highschool classes imaginable. \\n\\nFor those of you who have seen the film\\, you will understand: Rabbit-horse race\\, and space Leia.\\n\\nSave your time and money. Skip this one.","true":true}
