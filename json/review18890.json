Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a show about how to ruin childhoods\\n\\nIt's also a show that lets you know that being a white man means being the scum of the earth or the galaxy\\, every young white boy should know this - you have no future.\\n\\nThe show also implies that being a woman - you are a supreme being that don't need training\\, education or hard work to be superior to all. And more intelligent.\\n\\nThe show is actually a sequel - but one doesn't need to see the previous 7 films in the franchise because this show pays no attention to what happened before\\, this show actually makes a point of that in itself by destroying everything that a lot of intelligent people made before in previous films..","true":true}
