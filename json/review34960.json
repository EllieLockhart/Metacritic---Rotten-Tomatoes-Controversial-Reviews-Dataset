Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film reads more lIKE A FINALE than a middle film of a trilogy. A lot of time is wasted telling a story that goes nowhere rather than sticking to a main narrative. it doesn't leave much or any of a climax that can lead into a ninth film. i don't feel as though the theme of \\\"the force belongs to everyone\\\" is enough of a plot point to hang a narrative onto\\, but we'll see. in the end\\, all the characters are broken by their own stupidity\\, but no one is left hanging in peril to the point that it leaves the viewer interested enough in anything to come or be told in future iterations of the series.","true":true}
