Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not only did I hate this movie for the crappy mess it was\\, but I left the theater offended by VERY HEAVY-HANDED SJW PROPAGANDA PEPPERED THROUGH IT!!\\n\\nScrew you Disney.  I don't go to the movies to be lectured on social issues.  If I want to see that crap I'd turn on the news.  I have no problem with feminism\\, animal rights\\, equality and diversity but I don't want this shoved in my face in what's supposed to be a Star Wars movie!!","true":true}
