Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"That was just awful.  Every character in this movie was given a great disservice by being apart of this \\\"movie\\\".  No character was moved forward except for Luke (dead)\\, Phasma (dead)\\, Snoke (dead) and Kylo (taken control of First Order).  Poe (still just a fighter pilot\\, that likes to shoot first)\\, Finn (confused as ever) and Rey (still not taught but I guess may understand her place as a \\\"nobody\\\") felt flat.  I really liked all 3 in TFA\\, but now\\, I really don't care to see what happens to them in Episode 9.  I don't understand why there are so many articles defending this movie and attacking people that didn't like it.  Its a move - you either like it or you don't.  Apparently\\, I'm with the slight majority (49% Audience Score) that didn't like it.","true":true}
