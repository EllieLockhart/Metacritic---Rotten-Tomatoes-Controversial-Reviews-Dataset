Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After The Force Awakens and Rouge One set the bar stupidly high I think we all knew it didn't have to raise it but at least reach them heights but I'm afraid it fails in most ways\\, It's not a bad film it's just a bad Star Wars film\\, The story was overstretched and stuffed with sub plots that wasn't needed\\, It had a few plot holes and some things that never got answered like That! Leia scene\\, What was the director thinking it made little sense and only succeeded in pissing people off\\, The acting was ok but Mark Hamill stole the show and played Luke great\\, I didn't like what they did with Snoke as all that speculation was for nothing\\, There was a few good plot twists and the action was great with some amazing effects but it wasn't enough to save the film\\, I can't comment on the 3D as I watched the 2D version\\, It was a mess at times and I did not like the ending\\, They ruined dark tone scenes with Disney style humour that didn't work one bit\\, It will be hated by hardcore fans but maybe casual fans will be less critical but I can see why it has gotten so much hate from fans\\, Let's just hope this isn't the beginning of the end for Star Wars\\, If it is then Disney has nothing or no-one to blame but themselves.","true":true}
