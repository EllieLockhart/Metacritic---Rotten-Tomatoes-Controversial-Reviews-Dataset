{"101487":177570,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The numerous failings and flaws of this film have been pointed out so many times in the other audience reviews here\\, but I feel compelled to speak on a few issues nonetheless: \\n\\nA). About \\\"fanboys\\\": Don't dismiss them. Star Wars created fanboys and fanboys are largely responsible for creating the Star Wars blockbuster phenomenon that has lasted for over 40 years. I was 10 years old when Star Wars (A New Hope) first hit theaters\\, and up to now its goodwill has carried me through\\, many times groaning (especially with the prequels)\\, but never perturbed as I am now. As I suspect it may be for many\\, the Last Jedi is the last straw. \\n\\nMaybe it is a conscious act by Rian Johnson to kill the past. He certainly seems to be enamored with his own genius in \\\"giving us the Star Wars we needed\\\" as opposed to what we wanted. It seems\\, however\\, that he was so busy trying to subvert expectations that he failed to produce a coherent script. Ultimately\\, Johnson opted to throw the baby out with the bathwater\\, summarily dismissing 40 years of Star Wars legacy and lore to prove his own brilliance in giving us something unexpected and new. Well\\, my expectation that the movie would at least honor the Star Wars legacy was certainly subverted\\, and it appears that many\\, many people feel the same way. Johnson\\, Kathleen Kennedy and the TPTB at Disney should not be surprised if by \\\"killing the past\\\" they also end up killing the goodwill the brand has carried for decades.      \\n\\nB) WTF plot points that haven't been discussed enough:\\nThe story is essentially two battles book-ending Rey's long weekend with grumpy grandpa Luke\\, with everybody else literally trying to keep busy until that is out of the way. And the best Johnson could come up with is a slow chase in space? I\\, as many other people have\\, wonder whether he ever saw a Star Wars movie before. Its not just the fanboys and geeks in this camp either\\, as his script defies basic logic on its own. Set aside that this chase takes place in an established universe where hyperspace travel exists and ships have different speed and weapons capabilities - the absurdity of it all is still highlighted by inconsistent developments in the plot. To wit: \\n\\nSo Admiral Holdo's big\\, top secret plan is to limp along until they can all sneak out on transports\\, go to Crait and use the base to call their friends for help. And in the middle of this\\, Poe calls Maz Kanata\\, a known friend of the Resistance\\, without anyone on his own ship let alone the First Order being the wiser...     \\n\\nOK\\, maybe Maz was too busy with her union troubles to forward a message\\, but did Leia or Holdo not at least contemplate trying to get on the horn with someone they knew? Instead\\, they sit on their hands while Finn and Rose go on their excellent adventure for 18 hours\\, using a transport to hyper jump away - again without anyone on their own ship or the FO even noticing... \\n\\nHey\\, maybe Leia or Holdo or someone else with some juice could have gone to Canto Bight or somewhere to use a pay phone there. Or better yet\\, they could have tried to get as many VIPs out on all those other transports\\, that are capable of hyper space travel and no one seems to notice...\\n\\nExcept for DJ. Who somehow knows Holdo's plan\\, even though the only people from the Resistance he has met are Rose and Finn\\, who wouldn't have been there in the first place if they were in any way privy to said plan... \\n\\nPURE\\, LOGIC DEFYING GARBAGE. \\n\\nFollow DJ's advice - don't join in this nonsense.","true":true}
