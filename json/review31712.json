Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So shocked by these poor ratings. Almost seems as if all these bad reviews are systematically orchestrated by a select few. This movie is absolutely phenomenal. Staggeringly well written. Keeps you on the edge of your seat with an exhilarating and unpredictable plot. Great performances from Rey\\, Kylo\\, Luke\\, and . I was a little irritated by the blatant attempt to make it a feminist\\, multi-cultural\\, PC movie\\, despite the fact it's written by a white male and produced by Disney. I'm all for diverse representation\\, but it's just too conscious and deliberate at times. This is easily accepted\\, however\\, due to the sheer power of the scenes\\, the dialogues\\, and character development. Best Star Wars yet!","true":true}
