Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What happened?  Why in the world did Disney choose Rian Johnson who's only major film was Looper(which was ok\\, not great though) to direct and have creative control over the most successful franchise of all time?  \\n\\nMy family are Star Wars fans\\, not obsessed but we enjoy the series.  The first half of this movie felt like SpaceBalls and not Star Wars.  Cheesy and over the top comedic attempts that nobody laughed at which cheapened the hard work of the previous movies.  The story is disjointed\\, makes little sense and some of the acting performances (commander on the ship at end) were downright awful.  \\n\\nMark Hamill did a good job with what he was given\\, but this is easily one of the worst if not THE worst in the series.  It pains me to say this....can we have George Lucas back?  That's how bad it is.","true":true}
