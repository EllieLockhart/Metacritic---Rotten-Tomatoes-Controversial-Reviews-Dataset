Moreover\\, the game offers the player full control over the combat actions\\, which range in variation to difficulty\\, giving the player an immersive experience in gameplay. To address the story\\, and how it is not remotely similar to the first game\\, I contend that the purpose of the second game was supposed to be different from the first. The first was a masterpiece\\, and therefore should not be repeated last we risk a boring and milked out plot. Therefore the second installment\\, as it showed\\, demonstrated another groundbreaking deviation from the gaming norms just like the first. I suggest everyone to play this game before giving their final thought. I understand that it might not be the best game or the game that you asked and expected; however\\, it needs to be said that this will be a once in a generation success in terms of gameplay\\, graphics\\, story\\, and character development. It really made me wish I were a person living in that zombie apocalypse to know the characters.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
