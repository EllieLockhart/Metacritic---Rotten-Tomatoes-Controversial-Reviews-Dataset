Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Im a Star Wars fan. Just a fan though\\, I'm not into the EU a big way\\, or would argue over canon\\, but I appreciate the story that the OT\\, and to a limited extent the PT\\, laid out. I liked Rogue One\\, just liked the attention to detail\\, the story\\, the visuals. I enjoyed TFA though I felt it was a little lightweight. I had high hopes for TLJ.\\nOn first viewing\\, I was impressed by the visuals and music\\, but found the humor\\, plot and some of the individual scenes jarring. In second viewing\\, it got worse. The problem is not that this is a SJW movie\\, cos it isn't. It's not a political movie\\, it just isn't. For example\\, strong women leaders\\, child slavery and indentured servitude have featured in the PT and OT. This movie seems to act as if these are suddenly brand new themes - so they are called out more explicitly than before\\, which doesn't really help the characters at all. But it's hardly new territory for Star Wars.\\nNo\\, the problem is that the story sucks. Just thinking about how to improve the story - and not imagining a completely new plot - just trying to keep the framework of this movie\\, anyone could do better.\\nTake the chase at the center of the movie: wouldn't it be more visually arresting if the Resistance were jumping from system to system\\, with the FO following? And the FO then could not ambush the Resistance cos while they could track\\, they could not anticipate where the Resistance would drop out of hyperspace. But the Resistance would be limited by the endurance of their jump engines\\, cos we all know how tricky they are to maintain\\, eh Chewie? So the Resistance fleet could scatter\\, but Hux is still able to track the main Resistance ship? Why? Well it seems as if a tracker had been placed on the Resistance ship\\, and to spice things up\\, placed by an unknown Resistance double agent. Which is why the escape plan has to be kept secret. So lets have Poe and Finn to Space Las Vegas to get some signal blocking tech\\, and have Rose be the plucky engineer to keep the engines going. But the double agent revels the plan..... All of this would be more interesting & real than what occurred\\, and more in keeping with the SW universe as we know it.\\nI could go on\\, but will summarize to say that Leia should have died\\, Ackbar should have performed hyperspace ramming\\, and Admiral Holdo could have developed into a more interesting character and perhaps kept for Episode 9. Finn could have died in this movie\\, by completing his ramming run\\, Luke could have actually faced down Ren\\, rather than milking an alien seacow.\\nMy point is that\\, at least\\, with one or some of these choices\\, we could have learned something about the characters\\, but in 2.5 hours\\, I felt no better off than at the start. Watching the Canto Blight scenes a second time again\\, I was frustrated by the fact that it wasn't cut in half\\, so that more time could be given to understanding more about Snoke\\, Rey\\, Luke\\, Poe\\, Finn\\, Rose\\, etc. But I'm not sure it would have matter cos 2.5 hours is more than enough for many other movies to do this successfully.\\nThe final scene on the Millennium Falcon was the most jarring - these are the last survivors\\, all their friends are dead\\, they can just fit on one ship\\, yet the scene looks like a photo shoot for Vanity Fair. Where's the trauma and loss? Compare to the final scenes of Empire and you'll know what I mean. Hell\\, just compare it to Rogue One.\\nI really don't know where they can go with Episode 9 now.","true":true}
