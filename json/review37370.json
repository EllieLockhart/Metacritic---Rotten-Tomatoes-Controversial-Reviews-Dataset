Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The prequels spoiled me when it comes to Jedi-on-Jedi combat. I really miss the fantastical type of lightsaber fighting from those movies\\, especially with today's CG tech. If you're going to have a terrible plot and constantly inside-joke about previous movies\\, could you at least throw some visual wizardry in there?","true":true}
