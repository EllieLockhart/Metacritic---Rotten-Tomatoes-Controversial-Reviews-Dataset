Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is incredible! Disney has introduced Admiral Ackbar one of my favourite characters from the original trilogy. You gotta love admiral ackbar everyone remebers \\\"It's a trap\\\". *Admiral Ackbar gets immediately  sucked out a window and replaced by a purple haired lunatic with no character development or likeability*\\, well frick. This and many other moments felt like a slap in the face from the \\\"Director\\\" Rian Johnson\\, who basically created a High School  spin off of Empire strikes back\\, neglecting to make any meaningful contributions to character or creativity to better the health of the franchise. Oh and Snoke is the worst villain of all time\\, who wears a bath robe to a final showdown???? At this rate we'll be seeing Marvel\/Star wars crossovers within the decade (god help us). A nice metaphor which suits this film\\, The last jedi is a puddle\\, on the side of the road\\, going on and on because it's really long\\, but never going more than an inch deep into anything.
