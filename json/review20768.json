Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I want so bad to like this movie. I want so bad to love it. I was so entertained throughout it\\, but had a few too many \\\"oh\\\" moments. When I reflect about it\\, I just feel disappointed about too many of the plot choices\\, and changes they added to starwars lore.  I really enjoyed TFA and rogue one but this adds together to just not feel like it paid off. I'm usually good at rationalizing myself into being positive about movies but I find it hard. while I might like it more on a second viewing\\, I shouldn't have to.","true":true}
