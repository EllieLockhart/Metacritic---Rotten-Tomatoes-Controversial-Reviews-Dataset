Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great flick. Seeing it a 2nd time I really enjoyed it more...outside of the Leia scene in space. That went too far. But overall...very well-done. Not at all what I was expecting.","true":true}
