Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Has Rian Johnson ever seen a Star Wars movie?  I don't think he even knew what The Force Awakens was about. This movie completely destroyed the Star Wars storyline. I am broken hearted. As far as I am concerned\\, these movies no longer count as official Star Wars canon.","true":true}
