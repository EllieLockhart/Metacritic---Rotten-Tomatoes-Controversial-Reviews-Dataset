Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My problems with this movie. Finn and Rose arc was unnecesary. Poe\\, Leia and the rebels didn't accomplish anything. Phasma was underused and trashed in like 3 minutes. Snoke... sigh. The codebreaker was filler. The first order didn't do anything either. Rey arc was all over the place as well as Luke's arc. Kylo ren was the only character that was developed in this movie. Everyhing else was characters doing actions with no real logical purpose behind those actions\\, and even then\\, they even weren't able to accomplish the actions they set out to do. This movie was fucking filler with nothing of weight going on. You could link the force awakens to the next movie and explain all of this in the scrolling word prologue and you wouldn't miss a thing.","true":true}
