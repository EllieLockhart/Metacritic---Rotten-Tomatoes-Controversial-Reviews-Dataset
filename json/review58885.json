She had the courage to let someone come out of nowhere and kill Joel in such a brutal and sad way\\, and then\\, in the middle of the game\\, show the motivation of whoever killed him\\, in this case Abby.\rI'm sad about everything that happened to Ellie\\, she's my favorite character\\, I love her since the first game and even more in Part II\\, but her search for revenge\\, in the end\\, left her with nothing and alone. She simply lost everything she had\\, but because of herself.\r\rI don't understand how anyone might not have liked the game. Maybe it's because they still don't understand that it's not a game to make you happy or have fun\\, but a game to make you reflect and put an end to your emotional.\rSimply a work of art.\r\rCongratulations\\, Naughty Dog.\r\rProvavelmente nunca sentirei o que senti jogando The Last of Us Part II.\rEste jogo tocou meu emocional de uma maneira que n\u00e3o consigo explicar.\r\u00c9 realmente incr\u00edvel o que a Naughty Dog fez com essa franquia t\u00e3o amada por mim e pelo resto dos f\u00e3s. Ela teve a coragem de deixar algu\u00e9m aparecer do nada e matar Joel de uma maneira t\u00e3o brutal e triste\\, e ent\u00e3o\\, no meio do jogo\\, mostrar a motiva\u00e7\u00e3o de quem o matou\\, neste caso Abby.\rEstou triste por tudo o que aconteceu com Ellie\\, ela \u00e9 minha personagem favorita\\, eu a amo desde o primeiro jogo e ainda mais na Parte II\\, mas sua busca por vingan\u00e7a\\, no final\\, a deixou sem nada e sozinha. Ela simplesmente perdeu tudo o que tinha\\, mas por causa de si mesma.\r\rEu n\u00e3o entendo como algu\u00e9m pode n\u00e3o ter gostado do jogo. Talvez seja porque eles ainda n\u00e3o entendem que n\u00e3o \u00e9 um jogo para fazer voc\u00ea feliz ou se divertir\\, mas um jogo para fazer voc\u00ea refletir e p\u00f4r um fim ao seu emocional.\rSimplesmente uma obra de arte.\r\rParab\u00e9ns\\, Naughty Dog.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
