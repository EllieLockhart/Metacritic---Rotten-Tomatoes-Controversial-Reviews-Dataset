Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many twisted plots in the movie\\, but they were not good twists. They caused confusing more than surprising. You need only few good twisted plots in the movie or even just one. If you want to see a good twist\\, you have to watch the Coco. The plot is great\\, believable and powerful. However\\, TLJ plots were so boring and felt like inexperienced writing.","true":true}
