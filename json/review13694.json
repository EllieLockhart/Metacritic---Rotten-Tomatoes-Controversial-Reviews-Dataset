Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If I look at The Last Jedi as Star Wars episode 8\\, which it is\\, there are so many problems with this movie. It ignores a lot of things previously established in the Star Wars lore\\, Rose and Holdo have got to be two of the worst characters I have ever seen\\, and it acts as if The Force Awakens never existed. Rian Johnson seemed to just forget that he was making a sequel and went off to do his own thing. As a Star Wars fan\\, this movie was just awful.","true":true}
