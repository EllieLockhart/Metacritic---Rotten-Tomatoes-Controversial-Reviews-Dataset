Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A weak plot\\, horrible character development\\, rehashing again of old story lines\\, to much needless comedy and so many things that seem like they where added just to serve as a vehicle to push merchandise. I question some of the critics reviews of this film. Maybe Disney bought more than just Fox over the past few weeks? What a waste of potential for something epic.","true":true}
