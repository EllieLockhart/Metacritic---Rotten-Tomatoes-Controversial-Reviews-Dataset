Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lack of integrity in their characters\\, changing the values of Lucas's legacy and outright SLAP IN THE FACE TO THOSE OF US THAT LOVE THIS FRANCHISE!!!!
