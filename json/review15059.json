Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left the cinema with mixed feelings after being extremely  excited for the movie. The more I think about the movie the more dissapointed I find my self. I am sure I will just parrot many others but I there were just so many things wrong for me. Seems like the new director just shat on everything JJ set up in episode VII\\, starting with Luke throwing his sword away and that trend continues through out the whole movie. I won't even get into all the blatant agendas that were shoved down pur throats in a fantasy movie ... that being said\\, I am still cheering for SW and I hope the next one will be better.","true":true}
