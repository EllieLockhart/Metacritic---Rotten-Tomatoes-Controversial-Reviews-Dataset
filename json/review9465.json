Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"good acting\\nlooks fantastic\\n\\nignores physical laws of space.\\nstory makes no sense. \\nthe characters are unrelatable. \\ngoofy athmosphere.  almost every emotional moment is turned into a joke. \\n\\n\\ni strongly advice watching it on less official platforms in order to reduce its profit. we can not support bad products like this.","true":true}
