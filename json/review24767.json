Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Much like Kylo Ren I am conflicted about this movie. It has amazing scenes and moments\\, but also very dull subplots. Everything with Rey (love her character)\\, Luke or Kylo is great but the rest could have been trimmed down... I'd say it's good but not amazing. I liked Force Awakens better. Maybe the third time will be the charm?","true":true}
