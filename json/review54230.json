Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not sure what the audience reviews are talking about\\, this movie was great.  I had so much fun with it.  Can't count the number of emotional moments I had.  There are some hardcore Star Wars fans that will never be happy with what's put out and I feel sad for those people.","true":true}
