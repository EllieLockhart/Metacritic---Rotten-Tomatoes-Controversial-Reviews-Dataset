Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Subversion\\, being surprised\\, seeing the unexpected\\, all these things are nice. While watching the film for the first time it felt very exciting. The moment it ended I was ready to declare TLJ the best SW film ever...but then I started thinking... so many things don't make sense. I'm not the type of person to throw logic out the window for the sake of a cheap thrill. If a movie's plot doesn't make sense and has inconsistencies with the established lore than it's a bad movie and problematic for the franchise even if it felt good and exciting the first time I watched it. The second time it felt like subversion for the sake of subversion.","true":true}
