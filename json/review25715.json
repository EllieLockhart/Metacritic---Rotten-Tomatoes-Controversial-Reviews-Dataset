Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not as great as critics have labelled it. Far too many plot holes\\, forced humour and repetition. This film feels like a carbon copy of The Empire Strikes Back. The character of Rose and her plot are unnecessary and forced. The only bright spot is the magnificent performance of Kylo Ren by Adam Driver\\, who perfectly encapsulates a Star Wars villain. Sure\\, the CGI was good but isn't it always these days? The Star Wars franchise needs to be seriously refreshed.","true":true}
