Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This writing was beyond bad...\\n\\n1. Ships that can go to light speed\\, but not catch a ship at normal speed? \\n\\n2. Ships running out of fuel? I don't ever recall a ship ever having to be refueled in any previous Star Wars...you would think their tech at this point would be nuclear power\\, I mean come on your blowing up entire planets.\\n\\n3. Finding the master code breaker?? Really?? Why doesn't this guy work for the empire in the first place? Or the rebellion?\\n\\n4. Main stream movie stars in Star Wars have no place...what's next? Bruce Willis as the next Jedi with no shoes...\\n\\n5. This movie just sucks...","true":true}
