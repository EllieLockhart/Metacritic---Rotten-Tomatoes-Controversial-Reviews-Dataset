Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really hated it. Going forward THESE Star Wars movies have nothing to offer me. I loved the characters from the original but hate all the new ones in these. I am not interested in seeing episode 9","true":true}
