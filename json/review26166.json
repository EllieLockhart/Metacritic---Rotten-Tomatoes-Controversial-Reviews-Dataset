{"101487":157957,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-30","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No true fan would post some of the stuff I've read on this site. I've been a fan since 1976 and this new generation of star war fans have no clue of true sci fi story writing. First star wars is about jedi\\, rebels\\, and the empire\\, notice the list jedi first\\, rebels second\\, and empire last\\, jedi are what made star wars popular\\, not to say seeing flying ship is nice and all but it gets a little boring\\, watching darth vadar choke the life from someone without touching them is sci fi at its best. Disney needs to see star wars will always sell itself for the name but it can destroy a name to and that is what this movie did. The story is the skywalker family is to bring order to galaxy and balance to the force and bring peace to the galaxy\\, and please don't tell me ben solo story is going to change where he is the last skywalker because his mom is leia and i just told every one the plot behind the disney story because that would suck big time if the writers are going there. Hey why not fly the falcon into the sun next movie and end the movie that way because thats what this movie is about. And if anyone remembers vadar was not all bad he loved just much like yoda said and his choice lead him down that path and he thought it would save his wife who he loved because he could deal with another lost\\, but through all the books and games and anime he was always trying to kill palptine even at the end he came to terms he would not kill his children. So here we are no jedi masters left rey a alone she is not a skywalker and ben solo is the only master left so I wonder what the next story will be\\, and please don't let it be ben solo comes to terms that he made a mistake and saves everyone by sacrificing him self to bring peace to the galaxy because I will drive to johnsons house and abrams and you guys fill in the blanks.Tired of going to the movies and seeing a generation of people trying to be nerds and have no clue what it is like to be a true fan boy. Just example me and my wife went and saw deadpool at movies the place was filled with children I looked at my wife and said these people have no clue who deadpool is because the comics have always been rated r and in the first scene of the movie people started to exit fast with the first m***f***r and this is what I mean about a bunch of wanna bees that have no clue. I've put in the time at bookstores\\, comic book stores\\, online anime\\, graphic novels\\, card games and board rpg games and now the people that tried to ban comics\\,anime\\,fantasy\\,sci fi\\, and horror are now lining up like they have a clue. Does every one know that disney use to turn these movies down and would not back them at all lets name a few starwars and back to future\\, marvel\\, and dc comics movies. Stop giving away money to a company who is trying to destroy lucus name because they know they have no talent at writing a story and for all you rogue fans that movie played with the notion of the force in the beginning but the end was the best with darth vadar coming down that corridoor killing every one in his path stop killing jedi and start making more because the force wills it that the jedi are star wars\\, because right not its like that scene in revenge of the sith with obi one telling anakin palptine is evil and anakin saying the jedi are evil because right now the story line that disney is creating is adding up to that. If the trilogy ends with the empire winning we know that disney is the empire. I will not go see the next one at theaters I will wait this time for rent\\, because I dont trust disney seems like there trying to get there money back for what they spent to buy the brand and they are treating it that way to and rian johnson you lie about being a fan of star wars\\, next seen yoda shoots lighting from the sky and destroys the next storyline book you guys have written \\,bye.","true":true}
