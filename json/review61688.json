As a story driven game it fails and it is sad. I won't even talk about Joel\\, it is ok to do what you want with a character but it could have been done in a better and more respectful way\\, it was just cheap shock and lazy writting (best example to compare with is SWTLJ)  Unfortunatelly this game has entered the club of soulless entertainment media like the new Star Wars Trilogy\\, Marvel Movies\\, Season 8 of GOT\\, HBO Watchmen etc.  What can I say it is just a game\\, even if we are disappointed there is no reason to linger\\, we should enjoy life more and be more careful when listening when someone tells us what to like or to buy.\rP.S: sorry for spelling mistakes\\, English is not my native language.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
