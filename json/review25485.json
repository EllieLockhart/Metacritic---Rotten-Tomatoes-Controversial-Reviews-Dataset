Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Normally I would give garbage like this one star... But to be fair.. even though this film did just about everything wrong that it could have... at least I was mildly entertained throughout.\\n\\nEverything else however\\, was a massive fail. Failed at telling a story. Failed at introducing interesting characters. Failed at Luke's character\\, failed at making this movie consistent with the last. Fail fail fail. \\n\\nI always refused to own The Phantom Menace... Until I watched this garbage. It's that bad I went out and bought the 6 movie saga box set knowing that as of now that is the only real Star Wars left.","true":true}
