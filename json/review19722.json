Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a legitimate disappointment. It seems like they relied only on name drops of the original characters and hit and miss simpleton jokes. The story arc was weak overall and just barely came together at the end for a half salvaged ending. I spent 60% of the movie trying not to yell at the screen about how stupid the scenes\\, props\\, and plot devices were. It was a mostly painful experience with a few nostalgic scenes and a very few fresh new scenes that worked. Overall\\, I wanna know who wrote the script so I can send them a strongly worded essay on how poorly I felt the movie was written and seal the letter closed with a rancid fart so they can feel how I felt while I watched the movie they made\\, disgusted but trapped. Trapped because I love Star Wars\\, but disgusted at what it has become.","true":true}
