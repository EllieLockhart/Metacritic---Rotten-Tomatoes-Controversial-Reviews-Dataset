Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie made me sad.  So sad I had to make my first review on RT (warning SPOILERS). \\n It was hard to see a franchise that everyone could count on for a fun romping adventure story\\, be hijacked by not only poor storytelling and dialog (we've had that thanks to Mr. Lucas before)\\, but also extreme Political Correctness and progressive political themes.  \\n\\nFirst let's address the storytelling and dialog. There are several jokes that hit near the beginning of the film\\, although the humor takes a distinct turn from previous iterations of the franchise.  Chalk that up to a new writer and director who has been clearly given the freedom to stray from all previously established themes and character personalities.  After that the story just dries up for the middle hour and a half.  I have never checked my watch during a Star Wars film before.  You will with this one.  Luke is just awful as a character.  Then there are a few head scratchers.  One of which was jaw droppingly bad.  Finn is about to sacrifice himself to save the rest of the rebels\\, when new character Rose (who starts out with a strong entrance then proceeds to ruin every other scene she is in) knocks his ship out of the way with her own ship in order to save his life and in all probability dooming the rest of the Rebel's including Leia.  There are plenty of other poorly written\\, edited and acted portions of the film\\, but to list just the ones that come immediately to mind would take several more paragraphs\\, and I doubt would be interesting enough to read through.  Plus\\, I have to address the overt political correctness and progressive themes of the film\\n\\nEvery male in the film is either overtly evil\\, a bumbling idiot\\, or misguided (except Luke at the very\\, very end\\, but before that he was very\\, very misguided).  Women are now in charge and unerringly possess good judgement and are extremely capable.  In the beginning\\, the leader of the rebels\\, Leia\\, is incapacitated.  Her first officer\\, a female\\, then introduces us to the second in command\\, also female.  After which we get a shot of the four people manning the key positions on the bridge of the main rebel ship\\, all female.  All of these women are also white.  I understand the previous movies were male dominated\\, I don't think this is any better.  Also none of these women ever do anything that is anything but brilliant according to the storytelling.  Then we get the corporations are evil trope\\, or should I say tripe.  Not subtly\\, mind you\\, multiple characters actually say so.  It's in the script.  Rich people bad\\, poor people good.  Meat eating bad\\, veganism good (okay I may be reading a bit too much into the filmmakers motives there\\, and this scene was actually funny and well done\\, but after being beaten over the head with all the other stuff I had to include it).\\n\\nI can't tell whether to blame Disney or Rian Johnson (haven't seen any of his other work)\\, but his one was a major dude.  I loved\\, I mean really loved the first two Disney Star Wars films.  This one was more Pocahontas than Lion King though.  I give it a 'D'\\, thanks to the last 20 minutes.  Before that it was getting a strongly deserved 'F'.","true":true}
