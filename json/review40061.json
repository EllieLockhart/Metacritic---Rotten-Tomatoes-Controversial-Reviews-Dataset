Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is my only review ever on Rotten Tomatoes. This movie was terrible. I'm Equally Upset that Disney is dismissive of the negative reviewers. we're not stuck in the past. we're not alt-right. we're fine with female leads. we just don't want garbage movies. is that too hard to ask?\\n\\ndisney knows what they did wrong (inserting an inclusive narrative in star wars\\, diluting the brand). until they turn this disaster around\\, i will not purchase anything disney\\, no more movies\\, no dtc app\\, no star wars tv show. sorry\\, fool me twice.","true":true}
