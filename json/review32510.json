Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017) is bold\\, visually-impressive\\, and filled with memorable moments. The writers take the characters into interesting new directions that may either surprisingly please or enrage fans. Despite some questionable narrative choices\\, these bold developments may stimulate original and creative ideas to further enrich the mythology of the Star Wars franchise in future installments. However\\, such elements also present inconsistencies with narrative continuity. The Last Jedi showcases an effective manipulation of sound and silence\\, accompanied by its striking imageries\\, to take the audience on an exciting and thrilling ride. Its breath-taking VFX\\, brave creative choices\\, exhilirating action sequences\\, and John William's signature score outweigh the film's apparent flaws.","true":true}
