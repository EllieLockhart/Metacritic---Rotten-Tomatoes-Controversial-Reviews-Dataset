The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"It is incredible how many people did not understand the emotion that this game can pass. It is not a perfect game because I believe this is not possible\\, but this game is certainly one of the best games created to date. I believe that many people hated the game because of the death of one of the characters most loved by the players and fans of the 1 game and yes\\, this feeling of anger and anguish is hard and makes you wonder if the game is really worth it\\, but it wouldn't work without that. This game as stated by the director is about hate and revenge and there would be no greater motivation for Ellie than this one. Another point is about the gameplay with Abby\\, maybe you wonder why the ND makes you play with the \\\"villain\\\" of the game\\, for a good amount of hours\\, until you see the story behind her motivation. Since Ellie and Joel's relationship is incredible\\, why don't we put Abby in their place\\, Joel took what she loved most in the world and she focused all her energies in search of that revenge\\, just as she took what Ellie most loved her in the world\\, and that took everything away from her\\, the relationship with the WLF was very superficial\\, something just to survive\\, because what mattered to her was only revenge\\, and after that she had nothing more\\, but in the end she found it a reason to live that was the meeting with Lev and that even reminds us a little Ellie and Joel (and the relationship built between them in the first game is incomparable). At the end of the game\\, in the final battle\\, the game brings a feeling of anguish because you end up falling for Abby throughout the journey and end up worrying about her and at the end of it Ellie realizes that killing her will not fill the void inside her and that wouldn\u2019t justify what she was doing. This is very clear at the end of the game\\, a bitter\\, empty feeling\\, because she lost everything she loved most\\, but she had to move on.About the relationship between Ellie and Dina I didn't think it was forced and it worried me a lot before the game's release\\, I think it flows naturally\\, but this is very personal to everyoneAbout graphics\\, I have nothing to say\\, one of the best ever seen to dateGameplay very similar to 1 game with some improvementsIf there is one point that I think could improve is the variety of faces of the NPCs\\, it is quite repetitive and as the facial expressions are very realistic you end up remembering them.I only touched on the points that I think triggered these polemics of the game\\, it is much deeper than that and just by playing you can understand this. But this is just my opinion and I hope you respect it ;)\u2026 Expand","true":true}
