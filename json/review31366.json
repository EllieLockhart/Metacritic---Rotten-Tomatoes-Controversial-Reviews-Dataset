Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"some have said it was the best Star Wars since Empire Strikes Back..... Not even close to it\\, they kind of ruined the franchise with this one what they've created is zero excitement for the next movie they could have gone in a couple directions with this movie to build up to a big showdown but there is nothing there at all.","true":true}
