Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars Movie. Period. Phasma and Snoke's potential were wasted in the worst possible way. Rey is still a Mary Sue character that never received training or character development. The casino planet along with its political messages have no place in a Star Wars Movie. Luke Skywalker's character was utterly twisted to the point where he is unrecognizable. The list goes on.","true":true}
