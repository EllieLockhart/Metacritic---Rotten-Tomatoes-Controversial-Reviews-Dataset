Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a huge Star Wars fan\\, but also a fan of good film-making and storytelling. Sure I may not be a professional at either of those. But I can tell when the flow of a story is disrupted and I when am forced to \\\"awaken\\\" from the dreamlike state of being immersed in this story's universe. I regard the ability to take people out of their theater\\, or away from their living room\\, when showing them your film\\, as being one of the very best traits of a great movie. This didn't even come close to keeping me in. And from the responses in the theater to certain things\\, I don't think the rest of the audience was full immersed either. \\n\\nI share similar sentiments as a lot of other people on here\\, so I'll leave that for you to read yourself. But I especially want people to see that there is a major disparity between critic reviews and fan reviews of this movie. Maybe there is a problem with the system of critics at the moment. Maybe not. But something must not be totally right if there is that big of a gap.","true":true}
