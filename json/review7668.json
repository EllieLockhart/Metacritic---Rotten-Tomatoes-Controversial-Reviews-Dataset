Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Excellent and surprising Star Wars movie. My complaint is with the Rose and Finn plot which added nothing to the story and distracted from the Luke and Rey stuff. But overall it was a fun film.","true":true}
