Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is awesome\\, exciting\\, surprising and funny. Having seen it twice\\, I loved the characters and story so much and can\u2019t wait to see where it goes next. The comedy was executed very well and the surprising plot points are shocking. The audience were very engaged in what was going on. Will definitely be seeing again. ","true":true}
