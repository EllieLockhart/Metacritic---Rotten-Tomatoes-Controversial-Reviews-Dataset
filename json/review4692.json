Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Complete disservice to the original fan base and new fans alike. Rian rebooted the franchise without any consideration to the story and characters J.J. left for him. The movie has an issue with its own identity\\, with too many ill-timed quips and plot holes; Disney is a cancer to the franchise. It is apparent that Disney has traded quality storytelling for merchandising and social agenda... the true First Order of our time.","true":true}
