Bigger straight paths and more control in the animal riding segments but mostly still true! I think it may actually be a step back\\, there is less Ellie on a water puzzles but compared to Uncharted 4 the environments seem less story motavated.\r\rSpeaking of story\\, holy **** from the macro to the micro\\, shiny as it may look this really is a dog turd. The laughable way it keeps shouting out random names while you kill the same 12 character models over and over again. The super simple and basic revenge story that does nothing new. The horrible pacing that added TEN HOURS instead of just ending the game!\r\rAbout halfway in I started to get bored of the gameplay loop and then a few hours later there is a huge change but it only made me go from bored to annoyed to really hating this game.\r\rThe gameplay stays the same throughout but the ludo-narrative dissonance does not so much \\\"take a dive\\\" as Wile-E-Coyote falls down a canyon. The game makes the gore and guns and throat-slitting fun and sound satisfyingly juicy but also wants to try to critique violence? Everything just feels like it is working against everything else and what a mess!\r\rThe gross way they have a trans character and lazily making their entire arc only about being trans. If the rest of the characters were not this shallow I would have been more offended\\, but luckily(?) everyone is lazily written.\r\rEllie gets the worst of it. When you play the first one\\, narratively you think about how they will deal with the fallout of \\\"Joel's Choice\\\" and how interesting it would be to play a whole game as Ellie. WELL... what you get is another Joel in an Ellie skin and about a minute of a sequel. Instead a very basic hunt these people who wronged you that could have taken Ellie out entirely and only have to change 2 flashbacks!\r\rWhat a **** step backwards in nearly every way!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
