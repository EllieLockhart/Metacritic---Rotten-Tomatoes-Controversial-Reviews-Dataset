Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game is the disappointment of the year.The creators of this game must hate their own characters. All to push a narrative the voice actor for Abby wants.I respect strong women and have no issue with who someone chooses to love or what sex they identify as. With that said\\, I do not understand why they try to make you like a character who murders a beloved character so much. If that is not bad enough the other character that you have also grown to love is portrayed as a murderous no concience having dog killer. Whilst the woman who murders your father figure brutally in front of you with a golf club with his brains still graphically attached to it is a dog lover. They do everything they can in this game to rip down the characters that you have grown to love. If you never played the last of us if you do not love the characters of Ellie and Joel the game is graphically amazing playability is good\\, fight scenes awesome\\, story garbage! complete aarbage all to push a narrative from the voice Actor that plays Abby. This game does not deserve anywhere close to 10 out of 10 rating it is not as good as the paid to critics are wanting to tell you there is absolutely no way this game deserves to be game of the year it doesn't deserve awards it doesn't deserve anything what it deserves is accolades for the graphics which are stupendous and if you like to brutally murder people this is the game for you. If you like to murder dogs this is the game for you. If you like to brutally torture people with Blunt objects with no choice to do otherwise this is the game for you. If you like to be depressed this is the game for you.. I played through this game twice just to see if I would like it better all I was was completely depressed and upset that they made every man in this game seem like a dufus or a murderer they made a young girl into a raging murderous lunatic with no conscience they made a little girl who we became to love broken and didn't even give her the ability to play guitar again by taking her 2 fingers she lost everything and still did not avenge her father figures killer. Neil druckman should be ashamed of himself. Naughty dog studios should fire the creator\\, re write this story and re release this game it is complete garbage as a story driven game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
