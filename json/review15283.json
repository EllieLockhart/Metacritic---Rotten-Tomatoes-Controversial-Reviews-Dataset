Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I like the movie\\, it's another classic. Incidentally\\, older Star Wars fans (age 50+) like the movie much more than the younger generation. But that does not surprise me much. I'm looking forward to Episode IX.","true":true}
