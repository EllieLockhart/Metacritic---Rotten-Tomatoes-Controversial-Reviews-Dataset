Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The special effects were great. I loved some of Yodas lines. However admiral Holdo wss a horribly done character. The events and plot were almost to the point of idiotic. Rey just knows everything\\, no weaknesses. Leia can wake up in space and fly. No one gets affected by vacuum of space when they pull her in. The whole guilt tripped casino planet scene was downright needless. Luke is next to meaningless. It all seems like someone's silly dream. It's definitely not a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
