Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"All people keep forgetting that u should rate EVERYRHING that belongs to a rating. Gameplay\\, the graphics\\, visual Effects\\, music and Story. Everything has a 10\/10 for me. But not the story\\, the story got an 7\\,5. So all in one its a 9\\,5 so i rate it a 10. Yes i had expirienced that emotional rollercoster as many of you. Also i feel like a lot of people are rating this game without even playing it\\, crying about Ellies sexuality or Abbys muscles\\, or that Joel died.... As many of you i also was annoyed at first at the 10-12hours Abby gameplay. But if u blend out the fact\\, that she killed Joel\\, She is a badass woman. I also thought that way of her\\, as we only had the Trailer with her and the seraphites. I loved that game a lot for me its game of the decade.
