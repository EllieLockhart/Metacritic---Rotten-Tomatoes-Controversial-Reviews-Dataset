Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A strong start and end keep together two hours and half of a classic-inspired Star wars movie. The photography\\, the special effects and Adam Driver's acting are the best parts of the movie.","true":true}
