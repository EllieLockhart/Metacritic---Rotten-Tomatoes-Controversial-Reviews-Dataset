Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Only positive things that came out of this movie was some of the visual scenes\\, mark hammill and adama driver's acting. Not just a bad star wars movie\\, bad movie in general. So much things that do not make sense for a regular movie as the second in a series and it really doesn't make any sense for star wars logic at all!","true":true}
