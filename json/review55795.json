Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Phenomenal score\\, great cinematography\\, fun movie!  It was very well done.  I was not a fan of how the story portrayed Luke Skywalker\\, nor was I a fan of how powerful they made Kylo & Rey at such young inexperienced ages.  The Luke I envision would not run off to a deserted island and hide\\, nor would he shirk from responsibility to help his friends.  All that said\\, I enjoyed the movie and I will watch it many times.  But\\, it is hard to put this in line with the previous films as it takes many stories down new paths I have trouble accepting.  However\\, this is a very well done film and it will do well to engage new fans and enable Disney to keep selling tickets.","true":true}
