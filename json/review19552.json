Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's well made: excellent sound and visuals.\\nIt has some good performances from some actors.\\nUnfortunately Thats about all that it can objectively be credited for.\\nThe story was different\\, but in a bad way with characters behaving in headscratching ways. Politics were ham fisted in.","true":true}
