Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is kinda of sad for me to do.....I have NEVER left a movie review. However\\, I must today. After watching it 12 hours ago\\, had discussions with my wife about it\\, and ponder all day on it\\, I must give this 3.5 stars. Plot holes\\, immersion breaking scenes\\, and forced content that just does not work. I am...a bit broken. Humor was not needed most of the time. They try to do humor like in the Marvel movies that JUST DOES NOT WORK here. Writers FORCED a love story on our beloved Finn with this random chick (needs some better acting skills) that ends up saving him after his glorious death scene. Really? Rey somehow knows how to use a lightsaber like a beast without training\\, can use the force accurately without training\\, and somehow taps into the darkside without really explaining anything. Her parents are junkies?? Really?? Junkies that left her in that planet?! What kind of thinly poor writing is this? And Snoke. Snoke\\, the most powerful villain imagined gets fooled and killed like if he is some silly throw away character\\, again\\, forcing a plot that could have had the great potential of being the best villain in all of the SW movies. I.....I am very disappointed. I left the movie...confused and....betrayed. I am a huge supporter of all Disney\/Pixar movies and SW franchise. However\\, Disney\\, you NEED to do the LORE justice. Decide on what direction you want (we want the darkness of A New Hope) and stick with it. Get better Loremasters (or get one if there is not one) who can correct the writers\\, producer\\, and director on the direction of the franchise and give the fans the best CLOSURE on plot lines and overall correct \\\"feel\\\" of the movie. \\n\\nUltimately\\, this is not the worst of all the SW movies. I believe it still sits above the first three chapters (although\\, not by much)\\, but it definitely is not nearly as good as A New Hope.  I will await with some caution for the next one.","true":true}
