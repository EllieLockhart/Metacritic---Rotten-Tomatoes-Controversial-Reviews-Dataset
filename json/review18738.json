Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a fun movie\\, but it is not Star Wars. In fact it gleefully subverts and directly negates everything you would expect from Star Wars. Luke Skywalker's character is unexplainably the complete opposite of everything that multiple films had developed. It makes no sense. There is virtually no character development in this movie - no motivations\\, explanations\\, backstories\\, questions answered. The only character that gets some development is Kylo Ren. Rey is still an enigma\\, the perfect flawless character who accomplishes more than Luke Skywalker could with zero training\\, again going against Star Wars Canon which we had come to expect. Ultimately\\, this movie makes me appreciate the character development in the prequels (despite the multiple annoying subplots).","true":true}
