Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Stars is heading in the wrong direction due to SJW nonsense. I purchased a fair amount of merch with Force Awakens. None for this mess. Indeed actually want to stop using my Force Awakens merch due the Last Jedi.","true":true}
