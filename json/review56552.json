Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi has some great moments\\, but is not consistent enough to be considered a great movie. The first hour of the film is wasted on a pointless arc that distracts from the interesting content\\, and the obvious political statements made are far more annoying and distracting than they are engaging. It also suffers from being unable to create a serious moment without the threat of a poorly-placed joke or gag. Rian Johnson does not seem to be able to create the dramatic tension that the original trilogy was so good at\\, and seems intent on adding unnecessary jokes at every turn. Wasted potential for what could have been one of the defining films of this generation.","true":true}
