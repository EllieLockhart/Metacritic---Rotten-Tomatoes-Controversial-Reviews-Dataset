Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really bad movie! Star wars is about the skywalker family -- the director should focus on that. Plus\\, Luke Skywalker as a character is so beloved\\, I don't know why the director destroyed his legacy by making him into a coward and old cynical hermit. Really bad decision!","true":true}
