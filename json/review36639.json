Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is entertaining and fun. However\\, it has many flaws. It has a lot going on but it accomplishes nothing in the end. \\nPros:\\n- Stunning cinematography \\n- Great acting for the most part\\n\\nCons: \\n- Finn and Rose subplot leads to nothing and is unnecessary\\, and this is like half of the movie\\n- Only main character that had character development was Poe. And even then it was minimum\\n- Some major events in the movie are just there to create drama and shock\\, not to add substance to the story\\n- Unnecessary amount of comedy","true":true}
