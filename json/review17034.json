Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed it. It was a fun Star Wars adventure featuring most of the OT cast. There are some really strange moments that made my eyes roll\\, but what I liked far out weighed what I disliked. There is one thing I really did not enjoy\\, and that's this stupid sub-plot about Finn and Rose that really didn't need to be in the movie. I don't want to get to in depth into the movie because I'm not a pro-reviewer or something\\, but I enjoyed it. I really do not see why so many people dislike it SOOOOO much.","true":true}
