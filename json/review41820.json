Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is so boring\\, I would rather watch phantom menace for 10 hours than watch this slaying of the movie series that we have all come to love. Rain johnson is probably the worst director of all time. Instead of watching Luke be a total badass we see him milk a weird ass space thing.","true":true}
