Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite some great moments\\, overall I was really was unimpressed. Probably the most mediocre Star Wars movie plot so far. Be original.. stop trying to replicate the prior movies. ","true":true}
