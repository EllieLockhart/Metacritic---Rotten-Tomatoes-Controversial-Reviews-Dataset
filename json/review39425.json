Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is very poorly written. The new characters are either uninteresting (Rey\\, Rose\\, Poe and Holdo) or poorly written (Finn\\, Kylo and Snoke) and like many people I dislike the direction they decided to take Luke's character. I'd probably give this move a 3\/5 rating if it weren't for the fact that people are defending this movie simply because it's a Star Wars film. This is a bad film and Disney needs to do better if they want this franchise to succeed. The fact that this film grossed half as much as FA doesn't bode well for the future of Star Wars.","true":true}
