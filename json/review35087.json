Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The focus on the dark side of the force on this one was beyond words.  Things I would never have expected did.  The new generation of characters lives up to the old.  I went in with no expectations and was thrilled with what I saw.","true":true}
