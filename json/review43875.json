Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thoroughly enjoyed TLJ.\\nAlthough there were a few sections that didn't sit well with me they didn't detract from the wonderful experience I had.\\nA few of the scenes were some of the most exciting I have ever seen in film.","true":true}
