Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was certainly entertaining\\, but I did have low expectations after reading all the bad user reviews. Anyone worried that this will be worse than Episode I can rest easy. It\u2019s nowhere near that kind of bad. It wasn\u2019t my favorite of the series\\, but it was certainly worth watching. My wife and I both really enjoyed it. ","true":true}
