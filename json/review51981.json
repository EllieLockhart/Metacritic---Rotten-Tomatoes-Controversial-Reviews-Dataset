Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After 2 years waiting for this movie with the dramatic ending of The Force Awakens as a Star Wars fan I left the cinema feeling deeply dissapointed with all the missed opportunities that could have happened. It appears to me that the director was more concerned with surprising audiences with twists that you would not expect rather than actually thinking of meaningful answers to burning questions to key storylines that were developed in the previous film. The film has some decent action scenes which will appease some audiences however the direction it takes key older generation Star Wars characters may dissapoint Star Wars fans who grew up on the franchise.","true":true}
