Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was it the best movie since Empire Strikes Back\\, as I'd heard from some of my friends? No\\, Was it the worst Star Wars movie since the Phantom Menace\\, which I'd also heard from an assortment of people online? Not that either. Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\, is a solid film\\, with a good story. An interesting look at the progression of the new saga\\, and the gradual end of the Skywalker trilogy. Seeing Poe Dameron become a character beyond a couple action scenes and lines in the first film was exciting\\, and Rose is a refreshing new character\\, whose presence opens doors for more character development between the rebellion members. If I have any complaints\\, there was a little bit too much Kylo for my liking\\, but it made sense in what the film was trying to achieve. I don't have much sympathy for the guy\\, nor do I think he's a particularly compelling villain\\, his motivations are kind of foggy\\, but they have been since TFA. Another fault of the film was that Finn was not given enough focus for his character development. On a first watching\\, I thought he was handled very well and got to do a lot of heroic things\\, directly contrasting his \\\"I'm no hero\\\" stance in the beginning of the film. However\\, apparently Finn's plotline was meant to be him examining his place in the rebellion and where he fits in\\, now that he's left the empire. This was definitely something that left a lot to be desired\\, and he really could have used the focus. Overall\\, it was a very good movie that could have used a little bit more time to flesh out everything that it wanted to achieve.","true":true}
