Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this was one of the best Star Wars movies ever made and honestly don't understand why so many people ranked it less than a single star. People have even said it made the prequels look good. THIS IS NOT TRUE. The prequels are nothing compared to this movie and anyone who thinks they are\\, are totally disillusioned. Will the  director did make mistakes in The first act (Leia flying through the air)\\, it is more than made up for in the second act which should be the model for flawless storytelling.","true":true}
