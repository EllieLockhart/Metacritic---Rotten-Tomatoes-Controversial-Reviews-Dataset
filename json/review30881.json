Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So basically all of the unanswered questions from Force awakens somehow have no real bearing on the story? I just wanted to see Luke Skywalker kick some ass and find out who Rey's parents really are. I got neither. Weird how the best of the 3 Disney Star Wars movies is Rogue One.\\n#notahater #justexpectedmore","true":true}
