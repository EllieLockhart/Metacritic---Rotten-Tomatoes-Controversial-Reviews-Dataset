Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There hasn't been a Star Wars movie this good since the original trilogy. The Last Jedi takes everything that made The Force Awakens great and improves on it. It does borrow a handful of elements from The Empire Strikes Back\\, but the film's only notable flaw is its 2.5 hour long runtime. Mark Hamill\\, Carrie Fisher\\, Daisy Ridley\\, Oscar Isaac\\, John Boyega\\, Adam Driver\\, Andy Serkis\\, Domhnall Gleeson\\, and Benicio Del Toro all give phenomenal performances. The action\\, special effects\\, direction\\, script\\, and musical score are amazing. It's not perfect\\, but The Last Jedi is simply incredible.","true":true}
