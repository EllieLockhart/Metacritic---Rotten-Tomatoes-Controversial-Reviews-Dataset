Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi moves the Star Wars series forward by taking bold steps forward and taking chances. There are certain things in this regard that don't necessarily work out\\, but the moments that are truly great\\, are stellar-caliber Star Wars moments. This movie is able to flip the Star Wars formula upside down\\, for better or worse. Finally\\, the film's narrative flips a concept upside down. Instead of a story splitting into different scenarios; this time\\, it's a bunch of scenarios converging into one complete story.","true":true}
