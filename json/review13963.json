Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you enjoy pointless\\, plotless movies with gigantic holes\\, terrible new characters that make you yearn for Jar Jar Binks\\, humorless humor and flawed storytelling you will love this movie.\\n\\nIf you are looking for a real Star Wars story\\, this is not your movie.  Never have I been so disappointed....it's really that bad.  And no\\, I'm not a bot...just a very disappointed and angry lifelong fan who witnessed the beloved story of a galaxy far\\, far away being completely ruined by the worst minutes I've spent in a theater EVER!!","true":true}
