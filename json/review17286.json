Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to like this. It's badly written and its only saving grace is the special fx. It seems counter-intuitive to tell fans that you despise them for being fans when you want their money\\, but whatever... It left me with no desire to pay to see anything Star Wars related from Disney ever again.","true":true}
