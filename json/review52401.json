Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A great follow up to \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d! I would recommend rewatching \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d before going to see this for a refresher as to what\u2019s going on before jumping into all of the plot twist in this movie. I left with more questions than answers which gets me excited for episode IX.","true":true}
