Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Signed up to say...Jesus Christ\\, what a stupid film this was! No answers to any of the questions from Force Awakens. All the characters are stupid. No respect given to the original characters. Luke has turned senile. Leia can cheat death apparently. Holdo is an idiot. Rey is a still a mary sue\\, snoke? Who cares he's dead. Pointless Canto scene. No one develops except maybe Poe\\, a bit. Phasma was wasted\\, again. So many things wrong Im sure has already been stated before and I'm not even a massive star wars fan!","true":true}
