Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The General public will love this. If you are a star wars fan who has even the slightest bit of knowledge on the characters and background of the Star Wars universe\\, you will hate it. Disney have not ran with Star Wars and carried on with the feel of previous star wars films\\, but taken bits of the previous Star Wars films and mashed it together to try and make it appealing to all ages and groups. Keep it Star Wars\\, don't ruin it more than you already have.","true":true}
