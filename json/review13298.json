Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't write reviews but i felt i needed to in this case give how much the media has hyped this movie. Usually I judge movies based on how i feel when I am driving home from the cinema....in this case i felt pretty empty. As a Starwars fan i felt the character development in this film was terrible.  Why did the bother creating Snoke? What the hell did they do to the fantasy of Luke? We learned very little about Ray and Finn achieved nothing. The movie was well made in terms of the special effects and watching it with non-fans they seemed to enjoy it for an \\\"action movie\\\". The scene with the transport driving into the First Order fleet was very cool\\, and the desperation of the Rebels in their escape was gripping at times. However\\, the whole movie was let down by the lack of character development and\/or the destruction of characters before we even had a chance to learn about them.\\n\\nFinally\\, they way they treated Luke was unforgivable and quite frankly has ruined the trilogy regardless of how good the last movie is.","true":true}
