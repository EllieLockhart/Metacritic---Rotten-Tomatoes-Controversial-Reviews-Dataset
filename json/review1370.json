Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Art is subjective\\, so you can't fault anyone who likes or dislikes any movie. That said\\, this movie didn't work for me. By now\\, you've heard the complaints and they are valid. The director really missed the boat... It's tonally off in another galaxy\\, far\\, far away from the Star Wars we are used to. Some folks like that I guess. It's obvious now that this was not planned out as a trilogy. Anything built in The Force Awakens is torn down in this one. If I were JJAbrams\\, I'd start the next movie with Finn waking from a dream and nothing in this movie really happened.","true":true}
