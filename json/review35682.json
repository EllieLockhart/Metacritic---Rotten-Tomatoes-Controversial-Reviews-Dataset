Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a poor example of what a Star Wars film should be. The film executes its story poorly\\, not giving reason to character actions and making the entire list of characters act like fools. Once again\\, just like its predecessor\\, there is NO explanation for why characters are written the way they are. That is the epitome of poor writing. It is a pretty movie. However\\, any pile of trash can be dressed up to look good\\, but there will still be an underlying smell of garbage.","true":true}
