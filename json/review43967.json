Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thought this was much better than number 7! Better story development but still missing some character development. Snope? Rey? Where\u2019s the background. What\u2019s the future for our general? Curious already to see what they do with the next installment. ","true":true}
