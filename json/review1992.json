{"101487":105893,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As others are quick to point out\\, this film definitely has its flaws\\, and in seemed to have a bit of an identity crisis at times--does this mean it isn't worth seeing and deserves the current user rating of 56%? If you're wondering if this is one you should skip (currently having a lower user score than The Phantom Menace)\\, rest assured that it is a much better film than the prequels. Let's address the common critiques first to get those out of the way\\, and we'll focus on the great things happening in this film that make it stand out from the rest.\\n\\nAlthough some of the scenes were very funny\\, there are a bit too many dedicated to comic relief and\/or being specifically aimed at the younger audience with overly CGI'd characters. Guardians of the Galaxy-esque jokes dont feel quite right in some of the otherwise intense moments\\, but a few had me laughing unexpectedly hard. Don't worry\\, there wasn't anything close to being as obnoxious as Jar-Jar\\, but many of the scenes just didn't necessarily mesh together well with the film's otherwise dark themes.\\n\\nThere were a few plot points and issues with the storyline that you'll notice don't seem to fit in to the canon\\, but I won't discuss it further because of spoilers. A lot of it seemed to involve Rian's interpretation of how the force works\\, but nothing was so off that it was upsetting (looking at you\\, midichlorians!)\\n\\nNow that the negatives are out of the way\\, there are a lot of things this film does very right\\, and haven't been getting enough credit.\\n\\nWhen The Force Awakens was released\\, it was impossible to ignore the parallels to A New Hope\\, and was criticized for not being very original. This is not the case with The Last Jedi\\, and you can expect there to be unexpected emotional twists and turns throughout the film. Rian and Aabrams' film styles differ quite a bit\\, but it was refreshing to see the Star Wars universe through a different lens. It's also worth mentioning that Adam Driver and Mark Hamill had absolutely outstanding performances. Adam arguably carried the film\\, which was a very welcome surprise as we learn more about his motivations and emotions\\, and we are taken along the journey as he grows from an emotional\\, whiney loner into a very conflicted\\, feared\\, and unnecessarily brutal villan.\\n\\nThe level of complexity in the character development in this film has not yet been seen in the franchise (except in the novels and video games)\\, and was quite refreshing to see characters steer away from the traditional character archetypes and plot devices the in previous films. \\n(** Mild spoiler? **) Another notable and long-overdue improvement in the storyline is that there is no death star or equivalent space station to be blown up as the climax of the film. Thank God--the rebel alliance had to be running low on proton torpedoes by now...\\n\\nIn short\\, yes\\, this film has its flaws--the heavy use of CGI left me longing for more practical effects because they were well done when included\\, the exaggerated abilities of the force didn't quite line up proportionally to it's predicessor (nowhere near as crazy as Yoda doing his frontflips in the prequels though\\, thank heavens)\\, and some may be left dissatisfied with still-unanswered questions from The Force Awakens\\, but overall it is a great ride full of unexpected twists\\, unparalleled character development and complexity\\, and a darker yet somehow more comedic take on the Star Wars universe that will leave you with plenty of cliffhangers for J. J. Aabrams to answer in the final piece of this trilogy. \\n\\nIs The Last Jedi the best Star Wars film ever made? No. Is it the worst Star Wars film? Not even close. I'd say it fits somewhere in-between Revenge of the Sith and Return of the Jedi. Hopefully The Last Jedi will start to be regarded in a better light\\, which the film deserves\\, as we sort through and accept the unexpected\\, heavy\\, and conflicting emotions this film presents us. \\n\\nMake no mistake\\, it's a great film and is absolutely worth your time\\, it just has a different feel than the other films that might not leave you feeling as 'warm and fuzzy' at the conclusion as the preceding films--leaving us feeling confused and conflicted after seeing our beloved heroes grow through their failures instead of successes\\, leaving us with plenty to chew on until the next instalment.","true":true}
