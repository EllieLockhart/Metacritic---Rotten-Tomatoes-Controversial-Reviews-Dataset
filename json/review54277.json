Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ignore the complainy hardcore Star Wars fans saying they didn't like the movie cause it was different & not as serious. The unpredictability and risk-taking is what made the movie interesting for me. Also the humor made it more human. It is basically 2018 after all... There wasn't even as much as they say. If it was another predicable story I would've been bored.","true":true}
