Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Destroying the Republic fully on A SINGLE system and regurgitating the same Rebellion vs Empire story arc. NO PROGRESSION. The Last Jedi flamboyantly hits the RESET button on the ENTIRE overarching Star Wars Narrative.\\n\\nWhoever is calling the shots thought it was a smart idea to redo everything. Because that makes more money? I don't even know anymore.\\n\\nPrequels = Clone Wars\\, Rise of the Sith\\, Fall of the Republic\\, Fall of the Jedi.\\nOriginals = Imperial Era\\, Galactic Civil War\\, Fall of the Sith\\, Fall of the Empire\\, Exploration of the Unknown Regions\\, Rise of the New Republic.\\nSequels = Erasing of the Republic\\, forced re-establishment of the Empire\\, reinstatement of the Rebellion\\, Erasing of as many old characters as possible\\, (OT means fuck all).\\n\\nI dunno where i started with this...I have NO idea how I can stay in love with this franchise. I've tried to force myself to like the direction this is going\\, i really am. I'm trying. But god\\, I can't. It's depressing. It feels shallow. And forced. And when I see people trying so hard to paint the direction of this story into something more than it is. Trying to show me that this is a masterpiece and that i need to view it through the correct lens to appreciate it. How much more do i have to adjust my disappointment to understand the hidden gem behind what the Director \\\"intended\\\" with this divisive shit pile.\\nSome clearly like the film and direction the franchise has taken. Film is subjective i guess so all power to anyone who likes the film.\\n\\nI just feel like Disney have taken these films in a direction that alienates so many (if not most) hardcore fans. Lots of casual fans and some big fans are fine with it. But I guess I'm part of the 50% who've been abandoned by Star Wars (or have abandoned it). There are few hardcore fans I've seen online who like the direction of these films. I really hope Episode 9 SOMEHOW rectifies ditch full of issues that Episode 8 created; Snoke\\, the comical First Order and Rebellion\\, all of it. One can live and hope. But something tells me Mr JJ Abrams doesn't care enough to redeem some\/any of those faults. Full steam ahead with the Star Wars reboot trilogy (the trilogy made to reboot the entire Saga narrative instead of advance it).\\n\\nGod i'm depressed. :(?","true":true}
