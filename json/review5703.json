Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Die hard Star Wars fan here. This movie has destroyed what we all know and love about Star Wars. Poor acting from Ridley and character development that falls flat on its face. Far too many jokes and missed opportunities to have meaningful\\, beautiful scenes. It left me angry from start to finish. It is clear that the cast and crew understand very little about Star Wars. From how the force works\\, to the feelings you should get from watching the movies. It is clear that Disney has with one hand\\, tried to gain a new generation of fans and with the other hand\\, toss the old fans in the bin. Bad comedy moments destroy scenes that should have been more important and fans will receive no explanation for any questions that needed answered. This Film is lazy and plays it safe. A few scenes where they try to do something new that we haven't seen with the force\\, but sadly it doesn't capture that sense of wonder as the rest of the movie is terrible and an insult to the real fans that\\, like myself\\, live and breath star wars. Disney killed Star Wars the moment they started making this movie.","true":true}
