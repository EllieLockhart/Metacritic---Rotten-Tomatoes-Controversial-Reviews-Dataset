Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been following Star Wars for 30 years. This movie has practically extinguished the flame of passion I have had for the franchise. I feel very disheartened and hope that Disney can somehow remedy this huge mistake of a film. Disgraceful film\\, I really wish Disney could feel my sorrow. ","true":true}
