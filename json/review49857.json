Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yoda was my favourite.\\nThe rest was disapointing\\, wanted to see kylo take the temple down\\, kill the jedi.\\nLeis bit was cringe\\, something out of the guardians of the galaxy\\, when she started flying back to the ship.\\nNot enough from snoke.\\nThe highlight of the night was vegan cheese in pizza hut before.","true":true}
