Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The original trilogy is treated horribly in the Last Jedi. Luke and another character from the Original trilogy that goes to his island\\, have motives and beliefs that are 100% inconstant with their arcs from a New Hope to Return of a Jedi are inconstant. Leias in the movie is good\\, but they have a bizarre scene with her and the message they wanted to convey in it could have been done better. \\n\\nSnoke is not explained well\\, Finns arc is not full of consequence. \\n\\nThe film continues strong similarities from the Original trilogy like the Force Awakens\\, but has its own new themes and messages that the Force Awakens did not strongly have. Unfortunately the most significant characters that survived the Return of the Jedi are character assassinated in the process along with all they accomplished. The New characters should have drawn me in after two films\\, but I dont care for any of them.","true":true}
