Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really long. really bad. if you want this nonsense to stop then make sure Disney does not get anymore of your or your kids money. they only care about the money and selling your kids dolls. Walt Disney would think this sucked. George Lucas would think this sucked.  It just made me sad. If you hated it register and rate it. let the peoples voice be heard. critics are on the take.","true":true}
