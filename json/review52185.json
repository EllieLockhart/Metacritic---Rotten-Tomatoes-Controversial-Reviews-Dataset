Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After waiting two years to watch the continuation of this trilogy\\, I was disgusted with the result. This was a Star Wars movie with no lightsaber duels or any epic scene. This movie turned into a comedy and had so much unnecessary scenes that destroyed the entire movie. What a disgrace of a movie. I can honestly say that the prequel trilogy is better than this garbage. Don't go watch it\\, save your money people.","true":true}
