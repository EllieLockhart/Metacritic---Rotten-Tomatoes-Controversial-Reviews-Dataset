Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie didn't take into consideration the events of the previous movie (TFA).  Writing a movie before the last one is finished is a terrible idea\\, but worse\\, they don't know the whole arc of the series before it began.  Rian Johnson went out of his way to buck every trend for all the wrong reasons.  Tricking the audience with 'gotcha' moments leaves the audience less fulfilled.  All Fantasy asks you to suspend your disbelieve\\, but once you break your own rules\\, the suspension of disbelief is halted.  This is the least satisfying of all the SW movies and did almost nothing to advance the plot.","true":true}
