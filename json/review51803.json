Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A failed attempt to please the new audience with poorly chosen one-liners.\\nIt has betrayed every single character of the old franchise to make way for demonizing social problems when it really wasn't needed. \\n\\nDisney needs to understand that Star Wars is a family film and that some things can be funny to both adults and children. \\n\\nThis movie is beyond saving\\, not even a theory of Luke being evil could even save it.","true":true}
