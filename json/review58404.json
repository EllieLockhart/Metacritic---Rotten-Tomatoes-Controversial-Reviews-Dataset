{"101487":100032,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After the movie\\, we all got in the car and Mariah who is only 6 years old stated\\, \\\" that movie was terrible\\, how could they mess up a Star Wars movie\\, why did they do that?\\\"  She has seen all the movies and likes Star Wars\\, we all agreed with her.  Look at the audience score\\, that tells you the story.  Disney just destroyed the Force Awakens with this garbage.  No character depth at all\\, Luke Skywalker deserved better for his character and the fans!  The whole Force Awakens was surrounded from beginning to end with let's find Luke\\, he was built up to be a hero again instead he was ruined with this!  Snoke was made out to be this powerful enemy only to be cheaply killed in this one.  The First Order has improved in every aspect except tractor beams???  The longest space chase ever at turtle speed and yet no tractor beams to end this crappy chase\\, no original story here\\, nothing explained.  Battle of Craite should be called copy of Battle of Hoth.  So how do you fix this Disney\\, how do I explain this to my kids???  Star Wars 9 really\\, how are you going to clean up this mess...I'm sure it will be like this....Beginning of the movie\\, all legacy characters including Chewbacca\\, C3PO\\, R2D2\\, and any others on the Falcon with the First Order in chase\\, fade to Kylo who says kill the past if you have to\\, he orders them to fire and the falcon destroyed within the first 3 minutes with everyone aboard.  Fade to Rey\\, Finn\\, Poe who steal a First Order Shuttle and head to Endor to take down the shields of the newly constructed StarKiller Base\\, Rey leaves to confront Kylo again as she senses he is still conflicted...No thanks\\, we have seen this movie - Return of the Jedi.  I cannot recommend this movie to anyone!!!  If you love Star Wars then you will understand how we feel about this movie and how it was a HUGE disappointment!!!","true":true}
