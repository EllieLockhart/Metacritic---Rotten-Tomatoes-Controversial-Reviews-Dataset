Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best looking Star Wars movies! Despite what many fans are saying the story line was rather great and had a lot of plot turns! If you can watch this movie not dedicated to Star Wars like a religion it\u2019s definitely worth a watch! ","true":true}
