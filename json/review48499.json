Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wld have been served much better by another edit and maybe some reshoots.   There are a lot of good parts to this movie\\, particularly the Luke\/Rey storyline and the Rey\/Kylo Ren storyline.  However\\, everything else about the movie is very strained and just bogs it down.  Some story tightening and maybe a rewrite of these sections of the film to present the point these parts are trying to make in a much more cohesive way would have really helped to make this a much better film.  Overall\\, it is an OK movie\\, but ha some REAL problems.","true":true}
