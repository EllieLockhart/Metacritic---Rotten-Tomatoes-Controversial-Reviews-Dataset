Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"As a big fan of the first game and its characters Joel and Ellie\\, I am really disappointed by this game. Graphics and sound are great\\, but the story is trash. I've watched the entire game on youtube\\, I'm not gonna give 60 bucks for this garbage. I would not download it even if it was free on Playstation Plus.  What a horrible sequel. Everything in this story is either nonsense or it spits on everything the first game stood for. Joel is a skilled survivor\\, he wouldn't be that stupid to give his name to strangers. Also\\, why do we have to play with Joel's killer for so long? No amount of context will ever make me sympathise with Abby after she kills Joel (in that horrible way) after he saved her life. This is disgusting. This is just leftist\/progressive agenda\\, let's get rid of main male characters\\, let's get rid of male role models as to not be misogynistic. Joel was a a father figure to all of us who played the first game and we got very attached to this character. He didn't deserve a death like this. Also\\, Ellie is very angry\\, I couldn't get a reason to bound with her in part 2. Very bad writting.This mindset may work in California\\, but not in the rest of the world. Also \\, the trailers were so deceiving. The developers said that the game will be divisive. Let's hope that the sales numbers are also divisive.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
