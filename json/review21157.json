Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was very disappointed in this movie\\, I had hoped for so much more. The character development is non existent\\, the only interesting character left is Poe\\, the others are not interesting and they destroyed Luke Skywalker. The unnecessary comedy moments seemed forced and awkward. Probably the biggest miss in my opinion was the untimely death of captin Phantasma\\, we never learned a damn thing about her\\, she could have been a bigger part of the story but naaaww\\, just kill her off. I honestly don't know if this series should go on\\, maybe this should be the last one. I don't think I care what happens next\\, this was star wars for millennials and I can't get into that.","true":true}
