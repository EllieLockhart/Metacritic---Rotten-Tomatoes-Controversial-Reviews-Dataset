Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The user reviews are on point with this film. The only positives to it are great visuals and it has some good moments\\, but it has few meaningful characters and an incoherent plot.","true":true}
