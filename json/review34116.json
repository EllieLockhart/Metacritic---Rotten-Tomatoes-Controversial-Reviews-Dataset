Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TFA was quite mediocre in terms of story but had good characters and set up TLJ very good. TLJ completely butchered the ending of TFA\\, Luke Skywalker a long the new characters. There are moments in this movie that feels like a parody of the core of Star Wars. \\n\\nI'm completely gutted by this movie and not looking forward to episode nine at all.","true":true}
