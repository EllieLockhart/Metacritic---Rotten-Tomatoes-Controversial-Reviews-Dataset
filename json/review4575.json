Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cleaving off some of the rot of the prequels\\, this film reestablishes its hero's journey heart by giving the narrative back to the nobodies. Sure\\, some of Lucas' commodification of the world he created continues (here's looking to you\\, space chicken)\\, but the narrative falls back to the good parts of its roots while continuing to expand them. The best part is probably how the main villain is basically an angry fanboy.","true":true}
