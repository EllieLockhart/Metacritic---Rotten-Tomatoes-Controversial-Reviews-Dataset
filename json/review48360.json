Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Will probably go down as one of my all time favourite Star Wars films. I believe the film shows us that characters are not perfect and that makes it all the more great. The fact that Luke was no Herculean hero and instead a flawed and conflicted character as he was in the original films for me feels a refreshing continuity in a film that does such a great job of giving us something new and different. A perfect hero Luke makes no sense to me especially following his last meaningful appearance in Return of the Jedi in which the core of the final clash centres around his lack of control and flawed self. This makes him all the more a human hero\\, whom we could relate to. Even in the novels following the original series Luke was no perfect Herculean hero. Also I want to add to character flaws that hero's can also fail\\, why does a heroic plan to save the last remnants of a resistance fleet go so far and yet make it pointless\\, I feel in the past this would have been a fantastic twist\\, a clever twist were the first order was one step ahead but now a view of hero's having to always win dominates and so I say  what is the entertainment in that\\, isn't that one of the many reasons you should love the empire strikes back\\, because the baddies win? \\n\\nYes I would have loved to learn some more about snoke and was disappointed about this once I left the cinema\\, I later though\\, maybe this is a good thing? Why have everything solved and handed to us\\, so why not leave a bit of mystery and I think the same goes for Rey's heritage\\, I went in hoping but not expecting for some grand kenobi heritage but found myself shockingly pleased at the lackluster origin. I thought this was a great twist and reinforced a theme of everyday hero's human hero later emphasised by the orphan child. I do think people need to get a grip if they view the film in light of the countless theory video's they have watched and become committed to and so instantly view it negatively (I see a lot of that scrolling through here)\\n\\nNo film is perfect and if i had to lay criticism it would be towards the humour aspect\\, sometimes it can come off as childish and cringing but other humour in the film I did get a good laugh and even so I understand that children are watching this too. There is a large demographic base for star wars and one so big that surely it can't please anyone and some people need to realise this film isn't about them.","true":true}
