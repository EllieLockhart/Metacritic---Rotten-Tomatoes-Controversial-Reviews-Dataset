Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While it didn't go the way I thought (Luke warns us about this in the trailer)\\, I did enjoy the film as a whole.  It wasn't perfect\\, but all the butt-hurt people that were mad that their fan theory didn't end up being correct\\, can just shut it.  Movies are so predictable nowadays\\, and it was a refreshing script that didn't cater to people's nostalgic wishes.  We already got our \\\"money shot\\\" of Luke as a Jedi Master in ROTJ\\, what he did in the end on Crait was truly amazing and was consistent with the original intentions of the Jedi Order (\\\"A Jedi uses his power for knowledge and defense\\, never for attack\\\" - Yoda). Luke was able to confront Ben Solo without attacking him\\, protect\/defend his friends while they escaped\\, and showed a true mastery of the force in every way. His send-off was appropriate and beautiful\\, and I don't believe he actually died. I think he ascended and became one with the Force in a way we've never seen a Jedi do before.  I think he'll be back in a big way in IX and fans will appreciate that TLJ was the means that justified the end after seeing Ep IX.  There were some things that I'd do differently had I come up with this story. Ackbar should have been in Holdo's place\\, and the milking scene was unnecessary.  Also\\, Leia's force powers could have been done so much better\\, but all-in-all it was an epic story that I enjoyed\\, even being a die-hard Star Wars fan and big fan of ROTJ Luke.","true":true}
