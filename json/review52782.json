Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A long\\, rambling\\, boring mess. Characters are not developed. The plot is all over the map. Deux ex machina moments happen every time there's any hint of real danger. Overall\\, it is the most meh or meh movies imaginable. And\\, for the record\\, I'm not some fanboy that is upset over some supposed deviation from canon. I could not care less about such things. I went hoping to see a fun\\, fast paced\\, well put together movie. Instead I found myself fidgeting\\, yawning and looking at my watch\\, hoping this never ending marathon would finally end.","true":true}
