Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Way out of the box here. Look... I get that nobody wants predictable. That doesn't mean you can leave gaping plot holes\\, and replace it with anticlimactic vanilla flavoured yogurt scenes. Shame. Shame. Shame. Action in all the wrong places. I am of little hope for the last episode.","true":true}
