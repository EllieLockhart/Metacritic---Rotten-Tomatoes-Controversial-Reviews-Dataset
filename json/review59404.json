This story is as much about the execution as it is the plot.\r\rThe gameplay is tense\\, fluid and strategic. There is a good mix of different human and zombie enemies\\, and you can either sneak or fight your way through a situation. It makes noticeable incremental improvements on the first game\\, while not changing what works. Sometimes the looting can get a little bit repetitive. I would say the game is perhaps a bit longer than it needs to be.\r\rThere is a great low-guitar score\\, top quality voice acting\\, and the environments are gorgeous. Post-apocalyptic Seattle is rendered with beautiful weather and very realistic details. Having been to the city\\, I was surprised how familiar they made it.\r\rThis game is not going to be an easygoing experience with cartoon-happy endings. It depicts a dark\\, ugly\\, violent post-apocalypse in a very human way.\r\rBut forget what reviews on the internet say - this is a narrative you need to experience for yourself\\, with as few spoilers as possible. Go out and try it!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
