I\u2019d say that I\u2019d put it up there with Red Dead Redemption 2 as my all-time favourite game... but then the writers (the producers) made a big mistake. I didn\u2019t like Abby. As of now I\u2019m struggling to play the game. In fact I\u2019ve not played it for a day and I honestly don\u2019t want to go back to it. The choice the producers have made with regards to the main characters has destroyed this game for me and the realisation that I\u2019ve wasted \u00a370 is not a pleasant one. Tommy and Joel became buffoons. Ellie is horrible. Abby is completely unrelatable as a protagonist(?)\/playable character.\rWhat have you done?! I can\u2019t finish this game. Haven\u2019t felt this let down since Last Jedi.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
