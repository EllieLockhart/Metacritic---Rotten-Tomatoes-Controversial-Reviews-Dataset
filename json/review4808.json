Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Complete shit. Star Wars movies ended after the Return of the Jedi was made. Stop ripping off the Star Wars franchise for greed purposes. Idiots of earth these days.","true":true}
