Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ takes a bold leap in the Star Wars universe delivering a new\\, fresh take on the franchise. TLJ contains some of the best Star Wars material ever seen with the connection between the 3 core characters in Kylo Ren\\, Rey and Luke Skywalker. It was fun\\, emotional\\, intense and satisfying.
