Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Why Luke wasn't force-teleported himself into Snoke's chambers and cut the heads off of Snoke\\, Huxx and Kylo and we faded to black after 45 seconds of movie and finish this farce right away.His lightsaber seem to have power to be materialized through galaxy and do that? He's not materialized. But his lightsaber is. Because can be deflected by Kylo lightsaber blade. From that moment when Luke's lightsaber blade comes in physical contact (touch produces a loud crackle sound) with Kylo lightsaber's blade whole plot falls\\, because that Luke's lightsaber was not materialized\\, Kylo lightsaber would have passed through his as through the air.\\n\\nThis is most intellectually insulting SW movie I ever watched.","true":true}
