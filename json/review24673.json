Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie was entertaining but story and the Star Wars legacy was slapped in the face. Everything that had been set up or established in previous movies was thrown away with no logical explanation. Movie is overrated and not worth the price of admission. I recommend waiting until it comes out on Redbox. ","true":true}
