Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such a disappointment\\, the thought of actually walking out part way through literally crossed my mind.   Kylo Ren was the only character that made it worth watching\\, every other one was poorly constructed\\, cheesy\\, and hard to watch. The script and acting was way sub par and even the action scenes left much to be desired. After absolutely loving Rogue One\\, and getting through The Force Awakens\\, I was certainly hoping to see the momentum building; instead it evaporated faster than Falcon in hyperspace. I also found it odd that practically the entire Rebellion is now women\\, did the men get killed off? Not saying there aren't some great female characters\\, Rey and Jyn (Rogue One) for sure\\, but most of these just seemed forced.  If it weren't for Ep 1\\, this would be my least favorite Star Wars yet.","true":true}
