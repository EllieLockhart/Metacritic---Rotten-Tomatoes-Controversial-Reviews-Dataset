Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a huge step back from Force Awakens. Rian Johnson might have had a great idea for Episode VIII but wasted it badly ruining a saga that JJ will have to solve in episode IX.\\nI am going to underline what is bad of this movie in 8 points\\n1) Luke is awful\\, ruining a classic character to make him forgettable and go out and buy the new Star Wars toyline.\\n2) Leia survives. Why? So now JJ has to solve this bundle of NO CGI promise to the fans but in the meantime you decided to solve her premature death with a silly scene of..\\n3) ...the use of the Force. Yeah\\, first Kylo mindmelds with Rey\\, then Leia survives the blast all with the Force\\, so in the end nobody should die if that is how the force works\\n4) Snooke\\, useless character that people might criticise old SW fans for Palpatine. Well\\, Palpatine is not explained because there was (at the time) NO STAR WARS PREQUELS! Snooke pops up\\, looks like a 100 year old alien and just gets killed off. BRAVO!\\n5) Phasma\\, another ghost. So\\, did they make her shiny to just sell her as an action figure?\\n6) Rose\\, not really needed as a character since they already had enough of them. Doesn't serve for the storyline\\n7) The resistance doesn't talk to anyone\\, Poe is used as a stupid character and now just because in episode VIII they destroyed the new republic EVERYONE is on the first order side. Yeah Rian\\, whatever\\n8) Serious plotholes\\, forgettable moments\\, lots of useless detours. Rian Johnson didn't make a new era for Star Wars but a step back. in the future of SW this trilogy will be a step back\\, not like the Prequels but very close. Critics probably where paid well to give high ratings and underline how great and innovative this film was having never seen the first three Star Wars movies.","true":true}
