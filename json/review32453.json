Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars Last Jedi is a visual masterpiece that delivers a refreshingly new take\\, while keeping with some series mainstays.  This movie's theme is: failure.  As we go on the adventures in this movie\\, we are forced to face the fact that failure happens even to the best of us.  But\\, that sometimes our greatest teacher is failure. If the movie isn't understood in this light\\, it may come off as \\\"destroying a beloved character\\\" and\/or \\\"missing the point of star wars\\\"\\, and whatever else viewers are complaining about.  But once it is properly framed\\, it becomes a masterpiece.  However\\, even for a masterpiece\\, it isn't without it's own failures.  The movies at time seems to have a choppy pace\\, especially concerning the casino side story\\, which completely removes the watcher from the main story arch. There are also some character treatments that seemed under developed.","true":true}
