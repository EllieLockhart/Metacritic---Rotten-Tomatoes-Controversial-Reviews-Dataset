Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How did this movie make it to theatres omg!!!! Did anyone say anything at Disney when this was viewed in a boardroom setting g before release. Wtf happened HERE. How anyone making money I.e. doing this for a living  wouldnt immediately see the problems with this  blows my MINd and makes me question the intelligence of the leadership and entire team that worked on this movie. Star wars is not spaceballs ....you made a parody of a movie that is the movie you morons.. Out of the 30 to 40\\,major MIND BLOWING issues with movie I can elaborate on I will just mention 1\\nobi wan hands Luke his fathers LIGHT SABER this pretty much launches the story that is still UNFOLDIng stop me if I'm wrong he then  losses his hand finds out Vader \\n is his dad and falls..the LAST time he saw that saber was pretty TRAUMATIC and MEANINGFUL\\, he throws of over his shoulder that moment lost me I couldn't believe how off...that was it was over.....right there fire all epic fail epic just epic fire fire fire clean house immediately please...\\,.","true":true}
