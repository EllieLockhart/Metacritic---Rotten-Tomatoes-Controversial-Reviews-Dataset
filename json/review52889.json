Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An absolute disgrace to one of the better film franchises... genuinely cringing at the dialogue\\, abysmal acting and cheesy one-liners... *Spoiler* but imagine Luke Skywalker saying 'See ya around\\, kid' as his parting words? Absolutely shocking beyond belief. In fairness\\, visually it is a beautiful film\\, it's got some decent moments and good action in parts\\, but I digress... whoever cast\/wrote this series of Star Wars films should be fired immediately\\, ruining everything good about the film. I've never seen such a beta\\, embarrassing and utterly unenjoyable sith than Kylo Ren... Disney need to take a good long hard look at themselves after this\\, and look at what they are tainting.","true":true}
