Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked some parts of it\\, but there were a number of things in it that are weird\\, and why did they put some purple haired lady in the captains seat only for one purpose that we didn't care about because she did nothing to inspire us to care about her? They could have put Admiral Akbar in there and we would have actually CARED about it.","true":true}
