Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I agree with a lot of fans that this was a disappointment\\, partly because it was so hyped by the critics.  I walked out of the theater with a viscerally negative reaction.  I'd put the film somewhere between Phantom Menace and Revenge of the Sith\\, although it is much more epic and visually spectacular.  I was much more bothered this time that the film was a mishmash of old plot lines and scenes than I was after watching The Force Awakens.  I didn't like most of the characters\\, including a really pathetic Luke\\, Snoke (decrepit old man in a robe with a menacing voice) who just gets killed off without a backstory\\, Leia who just sits around looking worried the entire movie or in a coma and talks with a speech impediment\\, the Benicio del Toro character whom I thought was completely unconvincing\\, and Finn and Rose (the token Asian cast member) who go off on a meaningless adventure.","true":true}
