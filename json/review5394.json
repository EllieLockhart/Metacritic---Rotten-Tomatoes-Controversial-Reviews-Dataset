Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite a slow segment of plot and unconventional handling of legacy characters this movie was a joy to experience. Very tense and harrowing for much of the movie. Upon much contemplation of the movie's themes I have come to appreciate the subversion of many franchise tropes. This movie felt as though it pushes Star Wars toward an entirely new direction\\, one made more for future fans of the franchise than long-time fans like myself. Overall I respect and appreciate this change. The director masterfully manipulated our expectations in such a way as to crack open the future of this space opera. Above all this is a Star Wars for the kids who will grow up with it as their own.","true":true}
