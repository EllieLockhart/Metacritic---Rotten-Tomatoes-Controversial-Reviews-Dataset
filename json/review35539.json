Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a beautifully shot Star Wars movie. It has palpable energy\\, twists and turns\\, top notch acting and stellar sound design. There are some issues with the plot but there are only two Star Wars films that don't share this problem: Star Wars (1977) and The Empire Strikes Back (1980). It is just a movie after all.","true":true}
