Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Full\\, active\\, in intriguing\\, and very emotional. This movie spices the series\\, and introduces a lot of new things. Although it's a long movie\\, it shines brightly with it's emotional actions. Sacrifices and deaths make this movie make this movie breathtakingly sad. I rate this movie a four because I loved it so much\\, but it's extremely long and also I expected a lot more. After waiting for about 2 years\\, I finally watch it and not much is really shown. I expect a lot more to be revealed and I have to wait 2 more years for the next movie. I still really appreciate this movie for it's action\\, emotion\\, and astonishing and compelling impact on the whole series.","true":true}
