Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many plot holes and WTF moments to count. I mean seriously? Leia can somehow magically survive being blown into space and then fly back to the ship? I know she's sensitive to the force but I'm not sure if any Jedi master has ever had those kinds of powers. Also\\, seriously with how easily Snoke was killed? -_- facepalm to the max. If the rebel ships are lighter and faster than the FO ships\\, then basic physics would have told us that the rebel ships would have begun to pull away and would be out of range of the FO ships at some point. Just a couple of the many annoying holes in this movie. Here's to hoping that at least some of these things get addressed in the next one.\\n\\nOverall\\, just a very underwhelming\\, mediocre movie that doesn't live up to the reputation of the original Star Wars movies.","true":true}
