Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The problem with The Last Jedi is really the pacing and tone. The tone does not match the previous installments of the series. The comedy feels very out of place\\, and the pacing is poor considering. However\\, Rian Johnson is a great filmmaker\\, and the film truly is filled with some of the best Star Wars moments. Unfortunately\\, the subplots and character developments are generally flat. But the performances by all the actors are downright incredible. Perhaps the release of Episode IX will help this movie's placement within the entire saga.","true":true}
