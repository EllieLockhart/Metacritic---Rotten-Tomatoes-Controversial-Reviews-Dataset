Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw this movie on opening day.  I couldn't have been more excited for it after the awesome setup by TFA.  However\\, there are SO many reasons I have grown to despise this movie\\, very similar to what has already been written here.  Here are two of my biggest.\\n\\nI'm an OT fan and a woman who absolutely loved Rey in TFA and her potential as a character.  She was strong\\, beautiful and yet not sexualized\\, competent\\, good\\, smart...  A female character I was proud to let my son and daughter love\\, too.  But in The Last Jedi\\, she didn't struggle at all\\, and she did NOT move forward in any significant way\\, and somehow\\, against all odds\\, became way less interesting!  The most important job of a director is to move characters and stories FORWARD.  Did any of the characters move forward at all? I am SO very disappointed with Rian Johnson's writing and directing of every character in this movie.  The ONLY one who has some semblance of an interesting arc now is Kylo Ren\\, but that's not enough! \\n\\nAlso\\, the fact that REY is the CENTRAL CHARACTER in the SKYWALKER SAGA's third trilogy but is NOT A SKYWALKER and is also uninteresting is\\, frankly\\, the most sexist thing about this movie.  Since Kylo Ren is the only Skywalker left who has an arc\\, does that mean he has been the central character all along?  A villain - and a man!  (Don't get me wrong\\, I found TLJ sexist towards men too- and hated Holdo and Rose.) \\n\\nI do believe JJ has the ability to save IX\\, but oh man\\, does he have a LOT of work ahead of him.   :(","true":true}
