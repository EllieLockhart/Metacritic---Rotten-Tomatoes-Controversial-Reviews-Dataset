Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Insane amount of plot convenience and poor writing. beginning was a 5\/10 middle was a 0\/10 and the ending a 10\/10. Absolutely no suspense or risk for the \\\"Good guy\\\" characters. Everything was predictable to the extreme and they didn't kill a single important developed character. Incredibly poor if you are going for an intelligent well written story\\, but quite nice if you are going to simply watch stuff happen on a screen for entertainment.  Would go into more detail including all the terribly made parts i didn't like but I don't want to write a book","true":true}
