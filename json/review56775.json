Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only good thing about this movie is kylo ren as a character and mark Hamill as an actor. this movie was completely destroyed by Rian Johnson i hope Disney destroy his rep as a director\\, but i fell hes done that himself with this movie. everything JJ did to build character and deepen plots and backstories Rian Johnson completely thrown that out the window.\\n\\ni enjoyed  the movie in the cinema but at points it felt boring and dragged on and the humour omg the humour\\, i was cringing and curling my toes from almost all of it. they had to even open the film up with humour. it had a chase scene that lasted the whole movie infact it was the whole movie\\, ray was destroyed as a character nothing special about him\\, snoke was butchered\\, kylo was the only saving grace in my books\\, luke was massacred  to the point where hes not even luke anymore. finn is garbage\\, rose is pointless\\, phasma was fcked..\\n\\nthe critics are one blind or two being paid off because this is not a 8.1 \/10 its more like a 4\\, this movie lacks more story than any of the prequels\\, hell even justice league is better than this garbage.\\n\\nthank god JJ is coming back for 9 he should have stayed on for 8 and i bet you any money he is crying in bed of what rian did.... \\n\\ndont watch this film if u want to preserve everything you know about star wars","true":true}
