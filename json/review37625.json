Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is something wrong with this new trilogy so far.  TFA and TLJ seem to have no continuity and unrelated.  I felt the new characters are uninteresting and kinda boring (maybe Kylo has some interesting development)\\, I just don't care if anyone dies nor do I care about their futures.  I thought the story\/plot was terrible with maybe two highlights and two hundred low points.  \\nI hope the last will tie all 9 movies together as advertised.","true":true}
