Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am so scarred to the point where i am asking so many question that should have been answered in this movie rather than THE THIRD IN A TRILOGY( it is like we got no where ) . These question include: Who the hell was Snowke\\, who are Rey's parents and oh my god.....the plotholes. For one\\, why does that stupid admiral not tell Poe the plan.","true":true}
