Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a long time Star Wars fan I found the Last Jedi to be a thrillingly entertaining film that brings a fresh edge to the franchise\\, boldly taking it in a new and exciting direction. The chemistry between key characters is nothing short of scintillating. The battles are epic and the lightsaber duels are kick-ass. From what I can tell the haters dissing the film are simply disappointed that their theories they imagined before its release out have fallen flat - instead the film takes unpredictable twists and turns\\, elevating it beyond The Force Awakens and setting up for a promising 9th episode in a couple of years time.","true":true}
