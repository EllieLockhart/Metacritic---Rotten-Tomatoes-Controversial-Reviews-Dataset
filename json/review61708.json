{"40636":"was your average revenge plot gone horribly wrong Ellie literally kills everyone but let\u2019s Joel\u2019s killer go I could think of multiple ways to make this better like maybe Joel dies by sacrificing himself for Ellie near the end of the game then let Ellie chase after Abby. Do not buy this game the other thousands of negative reviews are just trying to warn you not review bombing people wouldn\u2019t be doing this if they didn\u2019t care so it has a reason because this game isn\u2019t about gameplay you buy for the story and it is horrible. Then there\u2019s outright manipulation replacing Joel in the trailers with Jessie. Also really Metacritic? Blocking reviews including my first one.","TLOU2":null,"2020-08-05":null,"10":null,"The Last of Us 2 represents how games should be made.
