Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't understand the hate. I was shocked as everyone would be. I think with time this movie gets more respect it deserves. I really liked the kylo ren and rey story arc. The movies was one thinng\\, very original. Furthermore beautifull editing (especially between rey and ben) and the film shot positions where really refreshing. Great acting. Also like the more social political comments in the movie. Furthermore it inspires young people to dream and belief in something better. It's for me behind empire strikes back. 5 stars just for the nay sayers.","true":true}
