Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was OK but fails to live up to the hype. Poor casting in parts and far too many \u2018comedy moments\u2019 It lacked any real suspense and parts of the movie (casino planet) should have ended up on the cutting room floor because they added little (if anything) to the slender plot. Such a shame. All that said\\, it passed the time and and it\u2019s certainly not as bad as the prequels. Hopefully episode 9 will lose the comedy moments and focus more on a good plot\\, better casting and a bit more of an edge.","true":true}
