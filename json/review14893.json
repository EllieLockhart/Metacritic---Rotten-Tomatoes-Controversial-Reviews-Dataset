Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hope everyone yells at me for loving this film. Objectively\\, this movie doesn't have that many issues. And most of them are very minor. This film has arguably some of the most compelling character arcs and conflict in the entire saga. Yes\\, the Finn and Rose stuff in the casino is a bit boring\\, but the core narrative surrounding Kylo\\, Rey\\, And Luke was very compelling. Rian Johnson knows what he's doing.","true":true}
