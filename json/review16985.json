Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really didn't care for it. The movie feels like a rough cut. Some more really could have saved this movie\\, but as it sits at 2.5 hours long\\, it's a godawful mess. There are several 15min sequences that add absolutely nothing to the story or advance the plot or characters that could have easily been taken out. \\n\\nOverall tone is also very non Star Wars. Some mind boggling story decisions being made. A lot of the setup from TFA we're just crapped on. Not sure what JJ Abrams is going to do with the third one but he has his work cut out for him because where this leaves off is just stupid from a story standpoint. They threw everything and the kitchen sink into this. Benicio del Toro is free next week? Sure send him down we'll find a part for him. What do we care\\, it's only 2 hours long\\, let's add more crap into it. ATATs? Sure. \\n\\nAll that being said\\, there's about 15-20 min of really good cinema in there\\, wrapped around a ton of crap. \\n\\nI will say I loved Mark Hamil though. And one of the best lightsaber fights of any of the movies.","true":true}
