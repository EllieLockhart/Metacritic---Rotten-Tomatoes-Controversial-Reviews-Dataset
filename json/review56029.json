Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Somehow I did end up hoping to see the same quality of story writing like in Rogue One and was utterly disappointed. The Force Awakens already left kind of a similar taste\\, but I could somehow still enjoy the plot.\\n\\nFor me it is important to feel submerged into a film by how it is written; important to feel like the story told ist serious to the characters. This was absolutely not the case with this one.\\nFrom somehow totally misplaced Disney-Comedy to awfully written encounters. Apparently Disney tryharded this genre into their own so far movie style for 'families' and did kind of ruin it that way\\, at least for me.\\n\\nIt was the first time in 18 years of me going watching films that I had multiple 'are you guys fucking serious!?'-moments while sitting in the cinema.","true":true}
