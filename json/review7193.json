Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"en serio me enojo lo que le hicieron la luck\\, no tienen perd\u00f3n el puto director de cagada\\, sin mencionar la rid\u00edcula persecuci\u00f3n mas lenta y estupida que e visto","true":false}
