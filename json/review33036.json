Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Stuffed full of too many bags\\, too many cute little creatures\\, and not enough REAL stakes. There were few twists\\, few turns\\, and few surprises (although the ones that were there were truly surprising)\\, and a large portion of the movie was focused on two inconsequential characters doing something inconsequential to the rest of the story. I was expecting the excitement of Rogue One. Did not get it.","true":true}
