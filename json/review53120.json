Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Average at best. No real plot twists and plot all together was bad. Killing off Snoke right away??? Looked like they were going to expand on the force and didn't. What was that part when she was in the pit..no explanation. Also Kylo goes from not being sure if he's good or bad to being bad and killing all the other students? That made no sense. Everything was kind of rushed through. No good character development at all. Lukes acting was average. I didn't mind how he died at all and actually thought it was one of the few bright spots his final fight. Just nowhere near the force awakens. I guess because all the summer movies sucked Hollywood is grasping at straws. Effects were decent.. I love the guy who says if you don't like the movie we don't like diversity so now this is a diversity thing hahah oh man. Great way to rate a movie. Bottom line Johnson is not a good director at all. Bring back Force Awakens director!!","true":true}
