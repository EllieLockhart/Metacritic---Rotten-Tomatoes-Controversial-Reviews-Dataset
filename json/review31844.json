Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoil alert: Worst Star War film I've ever seen. Four large ships chasing one ship. Wow\\, four ships to take over the Galaxy? Isn't that suppose to be the First Order's main feet? The last battle seemed like couple hundred First Order troops vs 30 resistance troops. The movie have no sense of scale. Isn't this suppose to be Star War? Where the epic battles? Also they turn Luke character completely upside down and did very little or nothing\\, pretty sad considering he was the main purpose on the last film. If you are a fan of Star War that likes the original trilogy\\, you will be disappointed.","true":true}
