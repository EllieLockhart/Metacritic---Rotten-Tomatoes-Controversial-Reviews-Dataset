Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi found a new way forward that hasn't been seen in this series before. Yes its not what many wanted but what we got was so much better. Luke told y'all this is not gonna go the way you think. Johnson took a shat on the OT and pushed Star Wars forward into the future.  I love Episode 7\\, the nostalgia was great but I dont need an entire trilogy of nostalgia\\, if you want that trilogy go watch Episodes 4\\,5\\, and 6\\, they're great and they hold up.","true":true}
