Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Any critic giving this a positive review was paid. Any viewer review giving 5 stars is fake. One of the worst movies I've seen in my life hands down. \\n\\nOn the positive side\\, this series is over. Don't need to watch these anymore. \\n\\nAny movie I watch now is great in comparison! It's wonderful\\, I was on the edge of my seat during little rascals with my daughter the other night! \\n\\nI was just going to take my medicine and deal with this pile of poop like everybody else when I started to see this propaganda that people giving bad reviews are right wing fan boys. If Luke was a transgender ice skating mariachi it would be better than this. \\n\\nInstead of jump the shark\\, we have \\\"drink the milk\\\".","true":true}
