Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"2.5 stars from Me. I didnt hate this as a stand alone movie. But for me\\, 40 years of movies and collections and tie-ins leading to it all pretty much being undone\\, well 1\/2 a good film is all I can muster. Fuel problems. Ha! Fuel never was a problem","true":true}
