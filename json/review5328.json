Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Definitely the worst one. Being part of a saga demands to have come continuity between the movies before this one and in this case\\, it feels right from the first 5 minutes of the movie like an intent from the director to scratch over the movies before and try something new\\, even if in the process it could burn all the good stuff from before. It has just too many plot holes that can't be forgiven. It suggests viewers to go on an argument to leave it behind like trash consuming a lot of screen time. This movie has a lot of bad moments that don't fit in what you can consider a good movie\\, because frankly it's not.","true":true}
