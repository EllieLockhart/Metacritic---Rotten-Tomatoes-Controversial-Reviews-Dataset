Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a fan of Sci-Fi this was a fine movie. It was visually stunning\\, and wasn't too slow even for a 2.5 hour movie. The only part I would cut is the nearly 30 minutes spent on Canto Bight (Casino planet). It's ridiculous at best and is an utterly useless section of the story.\\n\\nAs a Star-Wars movie this was absolute trash. It's in the bottom 2 or 3 for me including the prequels. Any rules set in place by the other movies are thrown out\\, characters make stunningly dumb decisions simply to further the plot. Characters purposefully mislead each other\\, but only so the audience can be tricked. Rey is the biggest Mary Sue I've seen recently\\, and some of the social commentary is laughable.","true":true}
