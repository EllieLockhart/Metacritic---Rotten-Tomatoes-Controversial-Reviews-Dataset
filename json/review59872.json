Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Pros\r- The graphics are amazing 10\/10\r- Combat is also really good because you see how they tweaked the fighting from the first game to part II and how they added many more things\\,which i think create a good gaming experience. (at least for me it did)  9\/10\r- Amazing cast 10\/10\r\rCons\r- Joel being killed off for shock value.\rI personally think that they should've killed him in part 3 or maybe not at all\\,because i just think that  the whole idea of killing off the main protector is so overused nowadays in these post-apocalyptic games.\r- This game is full of forgettable characters\r- Character development that was developed in the first game was thrown out the trash in part II\r- They forced us to sympathize with abby\r- So many plot holes\\, like way to much\r- There were one to many parts that were unwanted and unnecessary\r- The ones who wrote the game apparently forgot what made the first game a masterpiece.The Last of Us isn't The Last of Us without Joel or Ellie.\r- Waited 7 years to just see one of the most beloved characters of the gaming industry tortured to death and then we see our little girl Ellie all alone and sad.Which is her worst fear by the way\r\rOk\\,so i am gonna to stop yapping\\,sorry for the long read\rin Conclusion I think that there are good things about this game and a lot of bad things about this game as you can see.It killed me to see such a good story and characters go to waste.I am so disappointed in part II.The way they handled the original characters that we grew to know and love was just messed up\\,but i also wanna send a big thanks to everyone who put a lot of effort in this game.I think for me The Last of Us ended with the masterpiece that was the first one.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
