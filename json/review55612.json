Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"#NOTMYLUKE\\n\\nThree decades of commitment to a story to be thrown out by a director in order to be edgy or daring is not that at all. It's disrespectful to the fans. I'm not exited for the next one...hell any upcoming one anymore. Luke was my window into Star Wars. You've lost me Disney. George Lucas's Star Wars is where it ends for me and is what I will teach my kids.","true":true}
