Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A few plot elements setup in Act 1 (The Force Awakens) are ignored\\, or not given a good cathartic answer for. But the things TLJ does right\\, it does amazingly well. Fisher and Hamill give an amazing performance. Just don't go into the movie with any expectations is my only advice.","true":true}
