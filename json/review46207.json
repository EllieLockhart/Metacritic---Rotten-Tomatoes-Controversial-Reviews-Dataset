Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Want to know what this movie is about?   Just pop in your VHS tapes of the 1977 movie  and Empire Strikes Back. There you have it! Most of the plot of this retread.  Same basic story with new characters.  Oh\\, and who knew Leia had super powers as well!!  Weeeeee let's all fly through space without a suit........lame.","true":true}
