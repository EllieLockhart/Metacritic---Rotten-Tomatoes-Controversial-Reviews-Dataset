Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was so frustrated after the first viewing.  I went home and watched all the negative reviews and I totally understand where they are coming from\\, but after the second viewing I picked up SOOO much more that I didn't get from the first viewing.  This is a rich\\, dense film that has a lot more to it than meets the eye.  I absolutely love this film.  Don't think yourself out of enjoying this amazing film.  Yeah\\, there are a few plot holes\\, a few miracles of physics\\, and some really cheesy prequelesque moments that really distracted\\, but all of that seemed so much less distracting on the second pass.  In addition to that\\, I got so much more out of the dialogue that I missed the first time that really helped make a lot more sense of this film and made me see that this film isn't as \\\"all over the place\\\" as it seems at first.  There is a clear direction and purpose throughout that just isn't super obvious at first.  If you're like me and didn't enjoy this movie at all the first time\\, do yourself a favor and watch it a second time before you really make up your mind.  This film was so much fun!!!","true":true}
