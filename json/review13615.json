Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I felt that this latest Star Wars film was one of the weakest in the series. I know this because I fell asleep through parts of it. The plot was not tightly woven. The editing could have been better (way too much time spent on Luke's island). It also lacked the emotional charge of Rogue One and The Force Awakens. \\n\\nAfter the film was over and the house lights went up\\, I was just sort of \\\"blah.\\\" A mediocre installment of such a great franchise.","true":true}
