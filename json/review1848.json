Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\,As good as Episode Vii if not better.  I am not a fan of the new Star Wars movies though.  It is interesting to note how disappointed Star Wars fans were able to create bots to lower the audience rating of a perfectly acceptable movie. Never trust the aggregate audience rating of Hollywood blockbusters on Rotten Tomato's-its to easily hacked.","true":true}
