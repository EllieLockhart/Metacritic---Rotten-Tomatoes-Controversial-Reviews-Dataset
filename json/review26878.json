Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best films Star Wars Films since Empire. Writing was excellent. The comedy was right on point. and the characters were well developed. Surprises in every corner. This is not your mom and dad star wars this is something fresh and new and as a Star Wars Super FAN! I welcome it.","true":true}
