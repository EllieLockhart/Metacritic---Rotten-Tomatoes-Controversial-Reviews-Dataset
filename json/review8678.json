Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Flaming trash heap. Worst Star Wars movie ever. Movie tried to be original and wasn't.  In an effort to subvert audience expectations  Rian Johnson chuck to the story set up by  TFA out the window leaving this film a disaster and incoherent mess. Horrible movie.  I will not forgive what was done to Luke Skywalker.  If could give this movie  negative if Stars I would.","true":true}
