Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film has destroyed my faith in the force. The whole film looks wonderful but the story we come to love died a death. The story just doesn't go anywhere. There are holes in the plots and even the action sequences. Gutted this may have ended my Star War Journey from a child watching in the 70's till now.","true":true}
