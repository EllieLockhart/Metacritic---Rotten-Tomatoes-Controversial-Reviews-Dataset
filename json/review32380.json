Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars is dead for me.  Disney had a choice to make about the new trilogy. Having grown up on the  original trilogy I wanted a sequel to that. I Was fine was fine with new characters but I wanted to see the sequel that I hoped to see one day since return of the Jedi.   Instead Disney chose to use the original characters as segways to the new Star Wars.  I  find the new Star Wars boring. With all the characters I liked dead it's time to say goodbye.  What a terrible send off to the iconic characters that made Star Wars loved by so many","true":true}
