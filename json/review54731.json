Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw LJ at the Friday matinee and enjoyed it.  My rating scale for SW movies is a \\\"how many times I pay to see it\\\" thing.   I saw the SW movie where all the heroes died over a dozen times\\, I give it a 12.  I saw the Force Awakens where Han Solo is murdered by a light saber a few times\\, I give it a 3.  This movie LJ will be seen once more to just make sure it was as theme reamed as I recollect.  I'll give it a 2.  Adventure it has\\, suspense it has\\, but tech-sense it had not.  It is a requirement for good sci-fi story telling.  It seems to me that producers or editors gave the script writers a pass on things they should not have.  This HOLDO fiasco sits at the center of plot mayhem's where if Light Jump Ramming were possible it would have been done by drone strike missiles.  Come on.  The Star Wars paperbacks had a ship so black-hole dense it could ram through enemy ships like butter.  The whole HOLDO\\, low fuel\\, ram slam\\, script trip left a bad taste. A taste that tainted the story so much that you can't help but doubt every other sci-fi fantastical plot twist.","true":true}
