Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a fun movie. Much more humor than expected. There were a lot of twists and turns and some parts of the movie seemed forced and not needed. I had to see it as a Star War fan\\, but I could have\\, and maybe should have\\, waited for it to come out on DVD. I recommend seeing it\\, but maybe seeing it after it's at Redbox.","true":true}
