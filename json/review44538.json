Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Total and utter shit all reviews are paid by professional critics simply said uninspiring SJW piece of shit.\\n\\nSnoke dies like an idiot Luke the same\\nMary and Gary Sue survive.\\nLeia can fly why not!","true":true}
