Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is another solid entry into the Star Wars Saga. Is it the best film yet? I wouldn't go that far\\, but I will award it the funniest film to date for the tale of a galaxy long long ago. The plot was satisfactory in filling in gaps and answering questions. The action and visuals were among the best we've seen yet. Finally\\, the humor and acting helped make The Last Jedi strong with the Force and a great tribute to the OG Princess\\, Carrie Fisher.","true":true}
