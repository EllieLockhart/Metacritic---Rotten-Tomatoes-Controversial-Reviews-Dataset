Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was it the best Star Wars movie? No.  Was it the worst?  Certainly not! This is a solid entry in the series. Like Revenge of the Sith\\, the last 45 minutes are where  the best moments happen. It could have been trimmed a bit for a more charged plot line\\, but overall it was fine. I like the development of Kilo Ren's character arc with still so many unanswered questions as to why he turned to the dark side. I enjoy Daisy RIdely's Rei as much this time as I did in Force Awakens. All this talk of \\\"plot holes\\\" please - this is the greatest movie fantasy series of all time\\, you know fro experience that holes get filled along the way and you must stretch your belief and imagination just to enter this world. I agree with most critics - it was a fun ride.","true":true}
