Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was not what I expected. It was disappointing as a Star Wars film\\, and it led absolutely nowhere. The cinematography was strange for the franchise\\, and the characters were beyond lame. It's okay as a space film. I wouldn't have watched it\\, but as a Star Wars film it was a joke.","true":true}
