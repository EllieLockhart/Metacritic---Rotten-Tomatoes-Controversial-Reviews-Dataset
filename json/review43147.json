{"101487":187381,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-23","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"******THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS****** \\n\\nLet me start by... again... ranting against professional critics. Once again\\, they have proven themselves completely out of touch with the actual ticket buying public. The critics reviews on this site\\, show a stellar 92% approval rating while actual ticket buyers\\, as of this writing\\, gave it a 53% approval rating. \\n\\nI remember going to the very first Star Wars movie\\, back in the late 70's. I was a science fiction geek\\, reading as many books by as many authors that I could. It was obvious that it was something special... that it was the start of something really special in movies. \\n\\nUnfortunately\\, but not entirely surprising\\, the rest of the Star wars movies have been kind of hit and miss. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi was a definite miss.  You know how some movies are so bad\\, they're good?  This one is so bad...it's just very\\, very bad.   The Force Awakens and Rogue One were a great reboot of the series that Episodes 1-3 came close to destroying\\, so I had very high hopes for The Last Jedi... too high\\, I guess\\, because I left the theater feeling completely ripped off...and the more I think about it\\, the more obvious the glaring flaws in this move become. \\n\\nUnlike the good Star Wars movies\\, (or any movie for that matter)\\, this one was all cover and no book. Star Wars movies aren't really known for having a bullet proof plot\\, but this one was just sad. It's like they blew their budget on special effects\\, (which really weren't all that special)\\, and forgot to hire writers. \\n\\n****Ok... THERE ARE LOTS AND LOTS OF SPOILERS COMING UP... EVEN THOUGH THE MOVIE WAS SPOILED LONG BEFORE I WROTE ABOUT IT***** \\n\\nBy the time the last of the rebel ships were almost out of gas\\, so was the movie. They had enough steam to stay just out of reach of the super\\, duper bad guy Dreadnought... which can decimate a planet from orbit\\, but was impotent against a few virtually defenseless\\, out of fuel\\, ships. \\n\\nIt was a bit like watching the 'Death by Zamboni' scene in Deadpool... except it took much longer and just wasn't funny... or in any other way entertaining or believable. \\n\\nThen... with time running out for the good guys... the heroes embark on a cross galaxy\\, completely gratuitous\\, time killing side quest hail Mary search for the only code breaker that could help them out... when throughout the series\\, the best code breakers have been the pint sized droids... not people.  \\n\\nOf course this guy screws over our heroes...all for another very unsuccessful attempt at adding a bit of suspense. \\n\\nI haven't been this let down after a Star Wars movie since Jar Jar... and to be honest\\, Episode 1 was actually more entertaining. \\n\\nThis movie reminded me of 'Valerian'... plenty of bling which turned out to be mostly CG lipstick on a pig. The plot\\, (such as it was)\\, didn't do a thing to advance the series.  It explained nothing and went nowhere. The acting was wooden and dull... or simply unbelievable.   Since it was mostly the same cast from The Force Awakens\\, and I enjoyed that\\, I have to lay the blame at the feet of the director...who also gets the blame for writing this thing.\\n\\nAnd what is with those idiotic vehicles on a stick? What does the stick do? How is it better than wheels or simply levitating like everything else that isn't a walker? How does it make sense... even in a fictional world? \\n\\nOh... I almost forgot about the bombers that used a hand held 1950's garage door opener for the only bomb release button\\, (and one not secured in any way to anyone or anything) which means it could easily be knocked out of ones hand or otherwise rendered useless if the bombardier happens to die on the job.    On the other hand\\, it makes for a cheap device which is supposed to add suspense\\, but succeeds only in insulting the viewer.\\n\\nOh yah... how do you drop bombs in space... ? \\n\\nPlus... let's sacrifice a human general on a suicide mission that could easily have been performed by a droid... or a simple auto pilot? \\n\\nIn retrospect\\, pretty much every scene is seriously flawed. Hopefully\\, Rian Johnson\\, who wrote and directed this debacle\\, won't be given another chance to helm another episode. \\n\\nI was going to give this movie a 2 but after going over my review\\, I realize that was much too generous. \\n\\nIt is quite possibly the worst Star Wars movie ever made. Star Wars fans should just stay at home. It might be worth watching if you download it for free. \\n\\nPrepare to be very disappointed.","true":true}
