Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After The Force Awakens was a bland rehash of the original 1977 Star Wars\\, I thought the franchise under Disney's control couldn't get any worse. I was wrong. \\n\\nThis movie is stupid garbage that features blatant political grandstanding\\, character arcs that go nowhere\\, space battles that make no sense\\, and a complete disregard for the established universe.","true":true}
