Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not sure what movie these expert critics are watching\\, but honestly what a disservice this film did to the great characters that Force Awakens gave us. The movie wastes almost a full hour on a gaudy casino scene with relatively little substance or impact on overall story\\, wasting precious time that could be devoted to developing an intriguing master-pupil relationship between Luke\/Rey\\, as well as backstory into Jedi Lore and what happened to Luke and Kylo. Instead\\, Rey remains a static character with no real moral conflict or intrigue. The overall structure of the Rebel story-line is low-stakes (but drags on throughout the whole movie ending in a weak Hoth-redux). Additionally\\, Finn and Rey's relationship is wasted\\, as the only have 10 seconds of camera time together in the ENTIRE film. This movie could have been a great dive into the idea of balance in the Force\\, fixing the mistakes of the prequels. Instead\\, it falls into the same trap of over-ambition without detailed story structure. At least there isn't a line about sand (although there is one about salt).","true":true}
