{"101487":118868,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everyone is dealing with heroes and legends\\, and how they fail... as people it shows how we want the legend so badly\u2026 it\u2019s even the theme with the audience... we want the legend\\, not the man. Rey was troubled that her hero\\, Luke\\, was this disheveled hermit who didn\u2019t want anything to do with the Jedi. Rose was heartbroken that \u201cThe Finn\u201d was a deserter (even though he was just being a homie to Rey)\\, Poe had to deal with Admiral Holdo of rebellion legend history\\, who wasn\u2019t what he wanted her to be\\, Kylo struggled with Snoke\\, even Luke had to deal with Yoda. But at the end of the day\\, in the eyes of a child\\, heroes are heroes. And there\u2019s hope in that. More hope than in most of the film\\, bc in that you have rebirth. It\u2019s very elegantly told\\, bro. It\u2019s a mad powerful story. The most complex of any star wars\\, and the truest in terms of its side quest storytelling.... that\u2019s very OT era--but even that isn\u2019t a waste bc we learn that there is always purpose\\, even in those moments that seem like error\\, or that result in failure where coincidence breeds light. It\u2019ll be debated a long while\\, and it\u2019s because it\u2019s divisive. This isn\u2019t Abrams. And I love Force Awakens\\, but it\u2019s just fanfare. You know? It gave people what they wanted out of the characters there\\, and introduced some fun new stuff. Very Abrams. He\u2019s like Spielberg fused with Michael Bay. He gives you some heart\\, but he\u2019s also gonna give you exactly what you\u2019re asking for cause he\u2019s such a fan pleaser. Johnson gives you things that are hard to deal with. It\u2019s a much harder story to tell. People keep going on about Luke almost killing Kylo and how it\u2019s not Luke.... Like 1. we don\u2019t know what dude has gone through in the 30 plus years since the OT\\, and let\u2019s pray that he\u2019s not the same guy\\, and 2. Did we not all watch ROTJ where he almost kills Vader and then decides to stop? [Lets talk about Rey for a second] Rey is already hella force sensitive. We know this from the first film. She\u2019s already trained in hand to hand combat. We see that in TFA too. Yoda confirms that she already has what it takes\\, she just needs guidance. Luke gives her that with his resolve to drain all of his force energy in that fire force projection. As for Luke\\, what he does feels like an Obi Wan move... or a Yoda move... just all philosophy... and that line\\, \u201csee you around\\, kid\u201d? Tell me that\u2019s not one of the best lines of any movie. What a put down. [As for Finn and Rose] I know that the scenes were meant to establish that relationship\\, and also to bring in that kid for the pay off at the end\\, and also to say that things don\u2019t go the way you think they\u2019re meant to\\, with them almost getting to the actual codebreaker and then getting in jail and meeting Del Toro\u2019s character. Overall I liked the movie but there were some major holes. Who is Snoke and how did he get into power? Where are the Knights of Ren? Why didn\u2019t Luke teach Rey anything? Why was the casino scene so long? ","true":true}
