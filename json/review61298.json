Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This is honestly the best narrative \/ story telling experience I've ever had in a video game\\, I would go as far to say any media actually.\r\rThis is the exact reason why I believe video games can be a true evolution of art. What was done here is just impossible in any other media and will certainly be talked about and praised for years and years on.\r\rThe non-binary narrative and change in perspective that forces the player to deal with the full listening of a second perspective. Imagine you being quiet and just hearing out someone speaking about something you 100% disagree for 10+ hours\\, do you see yourself dealing with that? Well you should\\, because that's how you can improve as a person.\r\rThis game is a life lesson everyone should have and a lot of people learn the exact opposite of this (specially because of the internet). People are being trained at hating each other because of the most stupid things (liking\/disliking a media for example) and people don't have the mindset to stop and listen to that second opinion. You might not like it\\, but you must listen and give time to understand.\r\rReal life is exactly like this\\, non-binary\\, unpredictable and full of mistakes and dumb moments (I would say that 100% of humans in the world have put themselves in a bad situation without prior realization). This game is the definition of \\\"You're not prepared\\\".\r\rI know I won't change nobody's opposite opinion\\, and if you read up until this point\\, thank you and if you haven't played this game\\, please do\\, I feel this is an important tale. Be sure to play both games. If I would make one complaint about this story is that you too tied to the first one and you can only fully understand this game profound message if you played the first one.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
