Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hardcore Star Wars fan for life. Watch the movies religiously multiple times a month. This didn\u2019t give me that Star Wars feel. It was different. Different good or different bad? I left the theater in a neutral state to where we really didn\u2019t talk when stepped out unlike other Star Wars movies. Who is the real villain now? I don\u2019t see Kylo as scary and First Order is nothing. What do we look forward to in Episode 9? Rey has no parents\\, Snoke is dead\\, Luke gone\\, Leia gone IRL. I think Disney thought fans were attached and scared of the First Order... we\u2019re not. We wanted to see Snoke and learn the mysterious of the past and what brought him into power. Should\u2019ve saved the death for Ep IX. So Episode 9 will be about new kids shown at the end of 8? You need to make Ep9 a 3 1\/2 hour movie just to fill plot holes and character development to make fans care. According to TLJ though\\, you made a movie not for fans. I anticipate future Star Wars conventions will be 1\/3 more empty\\, then we\u2019ll see how false Disney claims these Rotten Tomatoes reviews are. ","true":true}
