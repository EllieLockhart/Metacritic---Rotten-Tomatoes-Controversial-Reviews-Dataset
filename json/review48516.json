Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wonderful film that gets off to a slow start but soon pulls you in.   Heart warming in it's nostalgia with all the action you would expect from Star Wars .   My 80 year old mother and the young boy sitting by us both loved it.","true":true}
