Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Garbage! When will the creators of new Star Wars films realize that the franchise's value does not lie in plot points driven by the need to take down a BIGGER GUN\\, with MORE SHIELDS\\, facing NEW AND IMPROVED ENEMIES with BIGGER WEAPONS! Keep it simple\\, focus on the conflicts and relationships that drive the characters\\, and stick to the themes of good and evil that drew people in in the first place. More CGI and generic Marvel Universe battle scenes should be left to big summer blockbusters. Please make the final movie into a good film that's not overshadowed by overblown action sequences and forced humor. Thumbs way down on this one.","true":true}
