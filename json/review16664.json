Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Incredibly stupid. Who would rate this a 91. It was kind of like watching Spaceballs. The characters were all caricatures.  The first scene where the rebel bombers have to 'drop' bombs...huh? They are in space; bombs don't 'fall'! And the 200' foot spear to catch a fish while standing on a narrow ledge. Well I guess it's a piece of cake cause he is the 'last jedi'.","true":true}
