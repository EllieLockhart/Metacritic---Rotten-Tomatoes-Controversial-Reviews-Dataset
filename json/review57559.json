Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this was truly shocking and not fit for the Star Wars franchise! - Johnson decides to kill off Abrams creations Snoke & Phasma - Snoke who can read all thoughts & drag people across rooms but cannot detect a light saber turning at his side\\, by his weak & pathetic apprentice. \\n\\nPrincess Leia flying through the vacuum of space\\, Kylo  more spoilt teenager than troubled Jedi. ... and the Jedi  Master who we have all invested years of our lives on\\, and looked to as a hope over decades phased out without so much as a whimper\\, it starts to become personal - an attack on all Star Wars fans across the decades. \\n\\nAnd luke milking an Alien?? tossing away the lightsaber that saved the galaxy (handed to him by Ben Kenobi passed on from his father) ... your a disgrace Johnson ... but Disney has agreed to get rid of Han\\,  Luke & Leia. . so the Galaxy Is theirs to do what they want with now.... Wait until an avenger ensemble type battle comes! - watch this space!   rumour is Mark Hamill was written out disagreeing with the story line as Lucas and Hamill knew where this was meant to go. .. \\nin any case a disgraceful mash up of the star wars we love & a character everyone pinned their childhood hopes on... shocking ! As Mace Windu once said \\\"I sense a plot to Destroy the Jedi\\\" but who would gave thought Disney & Johnson were behind it!","true":true}
