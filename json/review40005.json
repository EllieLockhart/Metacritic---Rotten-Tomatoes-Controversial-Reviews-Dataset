Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is just horrible\\, it really ruined Star Wars for me. Poor and horrible story with a boring 30 minuted casino useless act. I feel this movie was made just to angry people. And instead of accept criticism and move on\\, Disney blames fans for the hate this movie created. Just don't watch it\\, save yourself from the embarrassment.","true":true}
