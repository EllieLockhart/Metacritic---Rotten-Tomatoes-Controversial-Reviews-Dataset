{"101487":101320,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Almost as telling as the stream of negative audience reviews flowing in for this colossal failure of a movie is the desperation of some 4- and 5-star reviewers to discredit negative reviews as the result of \\\"disappointed hardcore fanboys\\\"\\, \\\"theories being proven wrong\\\" (?\u00bf? what does this even mean ?\u00bf?)\\, \\\"people not being able to handle artistic risks\\\"\\, \\\"salty haters\\\"\\, etc. For the most part\\, I don't think these accusations are true--I just think most of people reviewing The Last Jedi saw the same soulless\\, unenjoyable excuse for a Star Wars film that I did. For the record\\, I'm a casual fan at best (my only contact with Star Wars since marathoning the franchise for The Force Awakens has been watching Rogue One twice)\\, I went into this movie without any theories to be proven or disproven beyond what was set up\/hinted at in The Force Awakens\\, and I enjoy artistic risks just as much as the next person (like many\\, my main criticism of the otherwise solid TFA was that its plot was essentially Episode 4 recycled).\\n\\nWhat was so bad about this movie? A better question might be\\, \\\"What wasn't?\\\"\\n\\nActing: Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver turned in great performances\\, and they clearly put everything they had into making the best of the terrible writing\\, cinematography and direction. John Boyega was ok. Everyone else was next-level bad. I didn't believe the characters of Mark Hamill or Carrie Fisher (RIP) for a second. It got to the point where I felt uncomfortable every time they opened their mouths. Kelly Marie Tran as Finn's ridiculous buddy-adventure companion was cringily ingratiating. Domnhall Gleeson made for a terrible\\, unbelievable and absolutely unscary First Order general\\, whose attempts at any form of seriousness were totally undermined by a pathetic script. I'd mention the uncanny-valley awfulness of Andy Serkis' CGI-fuelled Snoke role\\, but the movie made clear that Snoke is not an important character in any sense. Benicio Del Toro\\, who was apparently playing a variation on the same character he plays in the Marvel universe\\, was mostly just distracting as a distinctive\\, high-powered actor in a bit role.\\n\\nPlot: Good god\\, the plot. Nothing meaningful happens over the course of the entire movie. Characters go on useless TV-style side quests\\, pursue pointless goals\\, are sacrificed for no reason\\, and make appearances that are probably supposed to feel grand but feel so transparently choreographed that they are utterly bland. Half the movie is drivel\\, the other half is shameless pandering to Disney-style humor and cutesy\\, and the whole is somehow even less than the sum of its parts.\\n\\nTreatment of characters: The reality is that Star Wars is a storied franchise\\, and the way that beloved characters both old and new are treated in this movie lends one the impression that Rian Johnson is deliberately trotting out cherished childhood memories to shoot them in the head and defecate on their bodies. Two out of the three \\\"death scenes\\\" (quoted because in neither case does the character in question die\\, per se) go very far out of their way to try plucking our heart strings\\, then immediately follow them up with sequences so bizarre that the viewer is completely removed from the experience of watching the movie.\\n\\nJumping the shark: Wow. I don't think\\, despite many questionable decisions (ewoks\\, young Anakin and podracing\\, Luke and Leia kiss)\\, that any Star Wars movie has really jumped the shark before. The Last Jedi didn't just jump the shark. The Last Jedi propelled itself so far out of the water that it exited the atmosphere and lay briefly motionless in space before coming back to life and flying back to the surface--conveniently on the other side of the shark\\, but leaving the viewer wondering what the hell any of this was about and why they should care.\\n\\nDisneification: Like deification\\, but instead of upholding something godly\\, Disney takes something great and makes a mockery of it with painfully forced\\, Guardians of the Galaxy-esque humor\\, shameless cutesy pandering\\, a proliferation of vapid\\, uninteresting characters\\, and totally failed attempts at dramatic effect.\\n\\nIn summary: After the success of Rogue One\\, I was cautiously optimistic that episode VIII would take the cue and aspire to be a legitimately good film on top of a money-making main trilogy installment. I watched it the day it came out in hopes of avoiding spoilers\\, but I left the theater wishing I'd just had the entire story spoiled instead of watching it. Nothing excites me about the impending release of episode IX\\, because I no longer care about any of the characters or story lines so carefully set up in The Force Awakens. I'm still processing the shock of the joyless trash I watched last night\\, but The Last Jedi may well have killed the main Star Wars series for me.","true":true}
