Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this was a great action film with the story carrying on from where the last film left it\\,  it has some funny scenes and plenty of action with hand to hand fights shooting and blasting each other and good star ships battles in space.  the story keeps you interested and some surprises to how things turn out.","true":true}
