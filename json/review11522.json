Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible. Not sure how this got so many good reviews. If you are a Star Wars fan do not ruin the rest of the movies by seeing this one. Would rather watch episode one on repeat than see this again.","true":true}
