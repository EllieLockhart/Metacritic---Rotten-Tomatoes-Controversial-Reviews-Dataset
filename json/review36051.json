{"101487":175688,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-12","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi takes a story with potential and kills it. It made Snoke a complete irrelevant character and gave Luke a meh ending. No issue with people that enjoyed it but I liked it less than the prequels. The only Star Wars movie I don\u2019t own and have only seen twice. Not sure what movie the critics watched.","true":true}
