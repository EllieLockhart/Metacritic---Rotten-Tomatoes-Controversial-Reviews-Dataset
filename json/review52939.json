Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An overall great Star Wars films with some very high highs but also some very low lows. I loved this movie but I will definitely acknowledge it has some major issue\\, mainly concerning the Finn\/Rose subplot as well as some other random issues. For me however\\, the great parts of this movie allow me to look past this and see it for what Rian Johnson was trying to bring to this universe: a move past of legacy and expectations.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi might not be what everyone expected or wanted but I feel that it is what the Star Wars universe needed. Kudos to Johnson for being brave enough for such a bold movie. Not every scene landed but I'm excited to see what everyone feels about this movie 2 years from now when Ep 9 is released or 20 years from now.","true":true}
