Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was disappointed with the story.   Looked at the director and noticed he did Breaking Bad \\\"Fly\\\"  episode.  It makes sense that I do not like this Star Wars because I hated Rian Johnsons work in Breaking Bad.  He has an odd take that really departs or derails from an existing storyline.","true":true}
