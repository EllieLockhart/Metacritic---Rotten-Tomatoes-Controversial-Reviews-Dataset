{"101487":133956,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have seen the movie twice\\, and I have to agree with the 56\/57 rating from the audience. \\n\\nPros: \\n1. Kylo has committed fully to the Dark Side\\, he has pushed his chips all in. I think he takes over this movie and has a stranglehold on the rest of this series. I think Snoke's tongue lashing in the beginning and Kylo saying \\\"I've given everything to you\\\" sparked his move. \\n\\n2. Agree with others that the Kylo and Rey connection sequences were the best part of the movie\\, you could feel \\nthe tension\\, the conflict.\\n\\n\\n3. The use of Yoda. The timing was right\\, the duration was right and his read on this situation was right. Obi Wan or Anakin would not have jumpstarted Luke in the same manner. \\n\\n4. Luke is right\\, in part\\, to call out the shortcomings of the Jedi. The council was stuffy\\, arrogant\\, dogmatic. \\n\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. I was afraid of them doing this to Luke. Instead of him \\nretreating to the Island to learn how to defeat Snoke\\, or deepen his knowledge of the Force for a purpose\\, he gives up\\, falls out of shape and has eroded. \\n\\n2. The humor doesn't work. Milking sea creatures\\, the Hux - Poe exchange\\, BB8 shooting coins. \\n\\n\\n3. Snoke went out with no explanation. I don't really care about who Phasma is\\, or Rose the moral compass\\, don't care about Maz at all. But nothing about who Snoke was\\, how he saw the rise and fall of the Empire\\, nothing. And now that he's gone\\, why would Abrams go back and explain it? \\n\\n\\n4. They have to do something with Finn. He has no impact after this movie and has been reduced to a footnote. \\n\\n5. Don't need horse racing\\, Leah floating\\, whatever DJ was with the worn out go find the world's best at something in a \\nbar (cue Wonder Woman).\\n\\nOverall: I think we have to harken all the way back to Order 66. That set up the Darth Vader\/Empire\/Rebel arc\\, but the \\nStar Wars universe from that point on has been shrinking. There are fewer and fewer characters. Less and less planets. Smaller and smaller Resistance fleets. Han is gone\\, Luke is gone\\, Snoke is gone\\, Rey's parents don't matter\\, Leah will be gone. And that's where I found myself thinking about the Prequels. The Universe was big then\\, full of planets\\, battles and worlds. Unless the Resistance gets some funding and grows in size\\, we are down to a Rey verses Kylo and the Millenium Falcon blowing up the latest First Order superweapon. The Skywalker saga is on fumes.","true":true}
