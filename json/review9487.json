Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good as a no brainer movie. However\\, as a serious movie set within the larger narrative of the Star Wars story not so much. Disappointment. Also\\, the backlash against people that didn't like the movie was unfair.","true":true}
