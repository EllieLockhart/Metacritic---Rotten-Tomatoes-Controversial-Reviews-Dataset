Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"RJ and Disney have destroyed the Skywalker saga.  The story betrays everything about Luke Skywalker and ruins the remaining OT characters.  The plot is basically a 2.5 hour slo-mo car chase and includes cringeworthy scenes.  Disney flat out tells you they are destroying SW when Luke explains it will not go the way you think and practically murders his nephew\\, Yoda telling you the history is worthless\\, and Leia saying do not follow me\\, follow Poe.  Disney's goal for short term profits has gutted the lifelong fandom that has made this such a profitable series for decades.","true":true}
