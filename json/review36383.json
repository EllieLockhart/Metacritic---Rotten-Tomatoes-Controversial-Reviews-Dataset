Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The more I watch this film\\, the more I appreciate it. Living in a post-Rise of Skywalker world makes it seem even better. While it does take several missteps with Finn and Rose\\, the scenes with Rey\\, Kylo\\, Snoke\\, and Luke are some of the best Star Wars I have ever seen. This was a film I didn\u2019t know I needed.","true":true}
