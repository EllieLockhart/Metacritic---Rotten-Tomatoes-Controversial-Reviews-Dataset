Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not only is this the worst Star Wars film I've seen\\, I think it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen in general. I laughed a lot during the film\\, but that was only because of how ridiculous it was I couldn't believe what I was watching. It was like the Family Guy version.\\n\\nThey wasted so many characters\\, and there's so many underwhelming moments that you just say....is that it??? After all the speculation and build up revolving Snoke \\, Rey's parents\\, Luke and Rey's first conversation etc it just shits all over them. It felt like RJ wanted to kick hardcore fans in the balls.\\n\\n **Major SPOILERS BELOW**\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWTF was that scene with Leia about??? she turns in to superwoman and  just starts flying through space while shes frozen lmao really?? It was so cringe!!\\n\\nRey's parents are nobodies \\n\\nWe find out nothing about Snoke and then they just kill him off?? Wtf what a waste!\\n\\nI found Lukes death beyond stupid\\, there were so many ways he could have gone out that would have been more satisfying.\\n\\nYou can tell Mark just hated this movie through his interviews and I think it's only a matter of time until he comes out and gives his real opinion on it.\\n\\nI think casuals may enjoy this film but for long standing fans I think it is a kick in the teeth","true":true}
