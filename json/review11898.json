Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Huge disappointment! Hard to believe the critics watched the same movie I did. The story was terrible by any measure. Luke Skywalker was portrayed as some defeated old loser instead of the hopeful hero fans know and love. The story gave me no reason to care about the new characters introduced in The Force Awakens. I can't imagine what would make me want to see the next film!","true":true}
