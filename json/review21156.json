Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was very disappointed in this installment. It is the weakest of all the Star Wars films. The story was weak and did not seem to move forward. There is no  sense of direction here.\\nLet's hope that the 9th installment recovers and ends on the right note.","true":true}
