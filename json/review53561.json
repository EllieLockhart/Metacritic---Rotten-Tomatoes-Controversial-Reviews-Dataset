Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Excellent follow up to the amazing The Force Awakens.\\n\\nWith throwbacks to Empire Strikes Back and Return of Jedi the film keeps the \\\"rebirth vibe\\\" Force Awakens started\\, yet The Last Jedi goes beyond the previous by presenting the most unexpected plot in a Star Wars film yet and leaving full of adrenaline and expenting anything could happen in 2019 grand finale. Episode VIII's biggest achievement\\, though\\, is creating much appreciated nuance in the light vs dark fight present in every Star Wars film which it does by following the thread left by the last episode and then developing the characters in an organic way by facing them with struggles that feel human and real among the flashy background. The only drawbacks is a sudden change of pace around the middle of the movie that severly slows it and some out of place \\\"Marvel\\\" like jokes\\, but together they are only a light hindrance.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi is a beautifully crafted movie\\, with \\\"edge of your seat\\\" action scenes\\, emotional moments and characters you really care about.","true":true}
