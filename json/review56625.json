Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is the most vital entry into the long running space fantasy that's drawn us in for over 4 decades. Rian Johnson simultaneously continues the existing story reigns left behind by JJ Abrams\\, while creating an entire new paradigm shift for the franchise. Make no mistake...this ain't your Daddy's Star Wars. Johnson deconstructs the overused and useless plot traps for a blue ocean strategy\\, reconstructing what the mysterious Force can Do\\, rebooting the foundations of the Rebel Alliance and proving that the Force indeed surrounds everyone...to that end\\, a Force user doesn't have to be a Skywalker\\, a Kenobi or an anyone. John Williams sweeping score fills the hole missing from last year's Rogue One\\, conveying a necessary ambience to each scene and propelling the emotional journey that the viewer is lead through. The performances throughout the film are rock solid\\, from the experienced and regal Carrie Fisher\\, to the grizzled curmudgeon Mark Hammill as the jaded Jedi who's lost faith. Daisy Ridley is amazing\\, lithe\\, emotional and the center of the film. She's our anchor\\, unwaveringly loyal to her beliefs and her goals. Adam Driver's Kylo Ren displays the rashness and mistake laden plans he did in TFA\\, yet takes advantage of his true enemy's weakness in the most jaw dropping moment of the film that I refuse to spoil for you all here. The flora and fauna are appropriately foreign yet familiar and the tech\\, visual effects and digitally rendered characters are all consistent with the worlds that Lucas built.\\n\\nThe most important aspect of TLJ is that it is\\, at its very core\\, a disruptive volume of the Saga. It takes the plots we EXPECT to see\\, ignores them\\, toys with them\\, manipulates them and replaces them with new concepts and ideas that remain true to the universe yet are bold and previously unseen on the silver screen. \\n\\nIt's rebellious. As it should be.","true":true}
