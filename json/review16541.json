Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In an attempt to subvert all of the past tropes of the genre and saga\\, it instead undermines and ultimately fails to live up to the storytelling of previous entries into the franchise. The logic of the characters are faulty\\, the humor is awful\\, the new \\\"rules' introduced detract from the elegance of past Star Wars films\\, the action is poorly executed\\, and the plot lines read as so manufactured that there is minimal joy to pull from this film. Especially when the one hope and joy people have been waiting for is an ultimate letdown; Skywalker. Hamill was right\\, #NotMyLuke. Instead of a numbered Star Wars film focused on the Skywalker saga\\, we received Disney's attempt to make everyone a princess\\, or at least\\, a Jedi and in turn\\, an endless line of \\\"saga\\\" films. Poor storytelling mixed with clear monetization means one thing; No\\, I won't forget the past\\, and trying to tell viewers otherwise is a poor attempt to hide the mediocrity you're now peddling.","true":true}
