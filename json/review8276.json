Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Far superior to The Force Awakens in every way\\, this movie feels like an entry to Star Wars that isn't a rehash of what we have seen before. Instead\\, this is a harder tale of friendship\\, teaching\\, love and death with a darker vibe on the ongoing war. The character of Ren is much more relatable in this movie and Poe\/Finn bring a wonderful dynamic to the series\\, in much the same way that Solo\/Chewbacca did. A worthy entry to the series.","true":true}
