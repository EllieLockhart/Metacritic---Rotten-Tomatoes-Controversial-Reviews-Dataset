Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the worst Star Wars movie ever made. It has made the franchise a laughing stock while at the same time destroying the legacy of our favorite characters. I mean who actually cares about any of the news characters or is exciting to see The Rise of Skywalker? lol What a joke.","true":true}
