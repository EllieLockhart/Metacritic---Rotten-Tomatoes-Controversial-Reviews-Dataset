Joel dies way too fast in the story and the whole plot is exactly the same as the previous game itself. One thing I can say that is good is the graphics and artistry that Naughty Dog did but other than that I don't see the appeal to finish this game. From the lies that they published to the actual gameplay itself does not really satisfy me as a gamer. The plot and this random character you get to play as (Abby) has no place in last of us and now you get to see her in the second one? What? Sorry for the rant and the spoilers but the game doesn't live to its expectations. I mean realistically game or movie series don't usually follow up well with the original storyline but this one is astonishingly bad. Why the fudge are we playing as Abby and how can meta critic and other recognizable gaming review sites rank it this high? This just baffles me. With all this negativity there are some good features about this game though. One of them being exposing the LGBT community into video games\\, but it seems like this game used it as a marketing strategy. Another thing is that it obsesses a lot of emotional and real life situation that many experienced in real life and this really attracted me from the start. My final thing is that the physics and controlling the character is pretty accurate and exciting. Combat is fun and it didn't change and I salute them for that. Overall this game has more cons than pros and a game like this that changed my perspective of gaming really let me down. I hope anyone reading this feels the same or if you don't thats fine. I am glad there are some people enjoying this game but I am not one of those people unfortunately. Why couldn't we play as Joel till his death or his brother Tommy? I'll leave it at that. Thanks.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
