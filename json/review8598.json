Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First off\\, I want to say that the movie was beautifully made. The special effects were amazing\\, the fight scenes were incredible\\, and there were scenes that you'd definitely expect for Disney to make into official posters.  Great action movie. With that bring said\\, I do not like the amount of questions that were left. Answers from \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" were answered\\, but they left more questions... And not in a great story-telling whimsically beautiful fashion.\\n\\n  Though the movie was 2.5 hours long\\,  the ending felt like a cop out... The emperor's role was terrible\\, I still don't see how Rey can just master the force do easily\\, and the portrayal of Luke was abysmal. This is a great action movie... Not a great Star Wars movie. Disney needed to keep the Star Wars universe alive... Not kill it","true":true}
