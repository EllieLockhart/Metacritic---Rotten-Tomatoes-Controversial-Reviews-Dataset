Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is one of two movies I've ever so considered walking out of\\, the other being The Phantom Menace.  Ultimately I stayed out of morbid fascination and because I understood that I was sitting through my last Star Wars movie.  I don't care what happens in Episode 9\\, and won't be watching that movie or future SW movies.  The movie is truly that bad\\, and it's both incomprehensible and terribly sad that Disney sacrificed e future of a multi-billion dollar franchise to push the politicized viewpoints of the producer and director.  And even the politicization was only part of the problem\\, the other part being professionally incompetent storytelling.    They've made their decision\\, and so Star Wars effectively ended in 1983.","true":true}
