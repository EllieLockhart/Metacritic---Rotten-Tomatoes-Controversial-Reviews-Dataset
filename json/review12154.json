Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a lifelong Star Wars fan. My dad was a projectionist at the single screen small town theatre when I was young. A New Hope is one of the very first movies that I have a memory of seeing. The Last Jedi was fantastic. they have managed to inject current sensibilities into the franchise without making it preachy. The action was great\\, just the right amount of humor and plenty of tension and drama. I am going to go see this movie at least a couple more times. No\\, I am not some corporate shill or russian movie review hacker. I am a regular guy that loves Star Wars and I loved this movie.","true":true}
