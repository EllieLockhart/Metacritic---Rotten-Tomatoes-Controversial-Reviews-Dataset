Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke Skywalker's saga is the single greatest version of a mythological hero's journey in cinematic history. If you're entrusted with continuing his story\\, you can't relegate him to a supporting role\\, and you definitely can't abandon all of the character traits that define him\\, let alone kill him off in vain. I know that Rian Johnson 'one time directed three really good episodes of Breaking Bad'\\, but he clearly is not up to the task on writing the second act of Luke Skywalker. To be fair to him\\, maybe no one is.","true":true}
