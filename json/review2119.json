Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A strong film with a few flaws. The casino planet side plot seem out of place when the fleet is feeling time pressure that there are only hours left to save them. Its not that it was horrible but might have been better served in a separate movie....The main plot of the ying\/yang of Rey and Kylo works\\, Luke is brilliant  as grumpy old man. I fail ito see why everyone wants him to be the farmboy from Ep IV","true":true}
