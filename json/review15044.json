Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I laughed once. I was surprised by one death. I was fully disappointed and bored always. My heart rate never increased; nor was I awed. Rian Johnson and Disney have ended my love for Star Wars. There was no climax. I now understand why Alec Guinness insisted on Obi Wan being killed off. ","true":true}
