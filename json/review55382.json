Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Love\\, Love\\, Love this movie. \\nAfter hearing so many people say the movie was terrible I didn't know what to think but after just seeing it\\, I am so excited and thought it was wonderful. The story of Luke and how his Arc went was fantastic and really felt honest. I can't wait to see it again.","true":true}
