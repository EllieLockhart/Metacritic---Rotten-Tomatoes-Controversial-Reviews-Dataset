Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Total steaming pile of crap.  Whoever wrote this must hate Star Wars.  No plot in this movie\\, destroyed what little plot the movie before had.  I won't be wasting my time and money on the next one.  This from a guy who\\, as a kid\\, memorized every line of the original and can still quote it to this day.","true":true}
