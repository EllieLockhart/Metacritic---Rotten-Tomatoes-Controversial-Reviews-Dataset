Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Every well set up plot point and interesting issue and secret set up in force awakens and in the saga in general is brushed under the rug and replaced by cookie cutter explanations that suits every generic film goers mind. Everything deep and interesting thrown out the window to make the franchise as easy to watch by everyone in the entire world and similarily makes star wars just one more space opera film with all the others.","true":true}
