Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My complaints about the movie are similar to consensus - it just wasn't good and the list of flaws is very long.\\n\\nHowever after I read through a few pages of the audience review (which is always more important the the critics imo) I am surprised at the level of scapegoating among the fans. \\n\\nSure\\, Mr Johnson was a big reason why this movie was listless. However\\, he was given an very poor story to work with. The prior movie managed to be more entertaining but it set the trilogy up for failure. The Mary Sue protagonist\\, the angst filled teenage boy antagonist and the washed up former hero turned misanthrope were impossible obstacles to overcome. It seems that the TFA just took too much air out of the room with the writing and Abrams direction was particularly selfish for the trilogy as a whole. This is clearly illustrated by the last scene of that movie\\, showing us Luke has become a hermit and using it as a cliffhanger. It's clique\\, its generic\\, it's easy\\, it leads to a good movie ending but it doesn't set up future story telling very well. That pretty much describes the entire TFA movie and that dubious introductory story is what fans should be mad about  in my opinion. \\n\\nIt is for that reason I knew this movie would be bad\\, there was just no saving the dreadful setup from the first movie. I feel the reason we didn't see the Jedi montage with Luke and Rey we all wanted is for that very reason. It wasn't going to change the fact that a young attractive female character who lacks humanism is not salvageable or interesting and the best thing to do is cut that character down to a supporting role and add in new protagonists with more depth. Rain took chances with this movie and missed on most\\, if not all of them\\, but he tried and may have succeeded in setting up the third movie better than what he was given. Time will tell us the answer to that\\, until then\\, take it easy on the finger pointing and scapegoating\\, so far no one has done this trilogy much of a favor and the core story is a dead fish.","true":true}
