Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I will start by saying I have been a Star Wars fane since 1983.\\nI have watched the original movies hundreds and hundreds of times\\, there is no flaw in them\\, they are incredible movies. Empire is a masterpiece and has so many different interwoven stories inside of it\\, and a masterful amount of character development.\\n\\nI feel like this movie was a pawn just used for Rian Johnson to develop his own career and fame. He wanted to make something shocking so everyone will keep talking about it\\, thrusting him into the spot light.\\n\\nWhy have JJ Abrams make ep 7 and 9 and someone else make 8? This doesn't make sense...\\n\\nThere are many holes in this movie\\, there are no holes in the original movies. They all make sense and work as a whole\\, this does not. \\n\\nThis isn't the worst Star Wars movie\\, the prequels were horrible. \\n\\nThe Canto Bight scene in this movie felt like a Harry Potter movie\\, not Star Wars. I don't know how this was allowed to pass the development stage of the movie. \\n\\nRey is super powerful for no reason. Even Luke had issues lifting the X wing in Empire\\, but Rey can do it all\\, just because? That just does not make sense...It feels forced because Disney wants to push Girl Power. \\n\\nAgain\\, I feel like Rian Johnson used this movie to project his career into the mainstream so people can talk about his movie. If you read his explanations of the decisions he made\\, he sounds delusional. He doesn't understand fans are mad because he made dramatic decisions\\, they are more upset with the plot holes\\, Rian.\\nHis decisions weren't fueled by wanting to make a great movie\\, but to make a shocking movie by messing with the stories and the characters we love the most. \\n\\nI enjoyed this movie to some degree\\, the effects were nice\\, except the Canto Bight aliens which looked like another movie to me. \\n\\nPeople making star wars need to understand\\, the originals are PERFECT\\, and they didn't have CGI! Stop using this fake looking garbage\\, the puppets are perfect! The human brain can tell when something is actually physical compared to generated in a computer. \\n\\nAgain\\, I liked some of the movie\\, but if you leave the theater feeling like to have to justify to yourself why you like it and \\\"maybe it wasn't so bad\\\"\\, then it just isn't a great movie.","true":true}
