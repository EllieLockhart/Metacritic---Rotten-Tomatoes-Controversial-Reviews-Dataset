Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Watching this was like watching a director unbuckle their seat beat and drive 100 MPH into a brick wall. Were they trying to kill a franchise on purpose\\, because that is what happen for me at least. The previous reboot was ok in comparison. Wont see the 3rd installment in theaters because of this mess.  Such a shame\\, so much wasted potential here.","true":true}
