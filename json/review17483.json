Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I see a lot of people giving hate to this movie\\, but it is so different a well done. Very refreshing to see such a movie. I understand that people don't like that they changed so many things and lots of things that we love for Star Wars\\, but they're really just giving us something new to think about. Luke even mentions how dumb the Jedi are and that's why we hated the prequels\\, this one fixes it and tells us that you don't need to be a Jedi if you have the force. People are complaining about the jokes\\, but this movie doesn't take itself too seriously and that's what you want from a movie about people flinging rocks. The movie is hilarious\\, fun\\, new\\, creative! I love it!","true":true}
