{"101487":122105,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-24","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From the perspective of someone who was in the audience (at age 5) for the first movie\\, and grew up with the ideas and myths of star wars very much as a core part of my world view\\, this movie hurt\\, and this movie was beautiful\\, and pretty much perfect as a continuation of the series.\\n\\nWere some of the plot developments hard to take? Absolutely yes. And if I had grown up following the stories of young Ben Kenobi\\, only to find out he'd become an eccentric desert hermit content to keep his head down while his enemies brutalized the entire galaxy\\, it would have been uncomfortable. And had he then almost immediately sacrificed himself so that others could carry the story forward - well yes. I'd have been outraged.\\n\\nWere there goofy antics and strange choices made throughout the film? Absolutely yes. And when I was a kid\\, the Jawas were pure delight\\, the Ugnaughts playing keep-away with Threepio's head totally worked\\, and nobody batted an eye at a gargantuan snorting pig men or cackling rat monkeys. Even more importantly - every cornball joke in the Last Jedi brought gales of laughter from the children in the audience.\\n\\nWas this the star wars episode 8 I expected? No. And thank the maker. Because how boring would that get?\\nI am just as surprised\\, and shaken\\, and excited to find out what comes next as I was after Empire\\, when my hero got ambushed by a yeti\\, floated around in a space diaper\\, seemingly won and then LOST the girl we all loved to a scoundrel\\, got endlessly trolled by a wacky elf puppet\\, flaked out on his jedi training to fall into a blatant trap\\, saved literally nobody\\, got his hand cut off\\, found out he was the son of seemingly the worst person in the universe\\, and then needed to be rescued. Brilliant. \\n\\nAs a side note - I want Mark Hamill to crowd fund an independent film project to show us the old man adventures of an unnamed mystic space adventurer with a laser sword. As a fan - holy heck Mark - please do it. I am sure we would pay for it. If you did it using the film magic techniques we saw back in 1977\\, you could do it without costing billions to produce.\\n\\nA last note: we've been watching these people drink blue milk products for 40 years now. And yes - this time I was aghast. And the 8 year olds in the row ahead of me were delighted. And I could feel the force ghost of my father sitting next to me rolling his eyes\\, and pointing out how silly parts of star wars were for the grown-ups in the audience back in 1977 too. Perfection.\\n\\nThank you Mark Hamill\\, for inspiring so many of us for all these years\\, and for having the grace and humor to do everything you've done.\\n\\nThank you Rian Johnson\\, for not playing it safe\\, and for looking forward instead of back.\\n\\nAnd thank you George Lucas\\, for setting this all in motion\\, and for building something that has become such a point of importance and passion to so many of us.","true":true}
