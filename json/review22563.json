Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let's start off by saying that what most people expected from this film is another Empire Strikes Back\\, and in that respect\\, the Last Jedi does not disappoint.\\n\\nIt seems like the writers at LucasFlim have opened the fridge of their past movies\\, thrown out the rotting carcass of the prequels and opted to take another bite out of some well-aged cheese\\, and by that awful analogy I mean to say that they are sticking with the movie style used in the original trilogy.  But as many of you will be glad to hear\\, Last Jedi hasn't taken the exact script of A new Hope\\, thrown in some shiny new graphics and characters and then proceeded slapped on a new name. *Cough* The Force Awakens *Cough* (Note: I still loved TFA though)\\n\\nHowever you will see some similarities between the two films\\, one instance of this is that the majority of both films have the space equivalent of me slowly driving my car behind someone down the road\\, every now and then hitting my horn just to let them know that I'm still there\\, but not making enough noise to irritate them in any way.\\n\\nOk Ben\\, enough with these shocking metaphors and back to the movie.  It is not a surprise to say that this is a beautiful movie\\, every scene looks stunning\\, and if you are willing to suffer from an intense head ache afterwards\\, you can marvel at it in IMAX 3D\\, the pain is worth it.\\n\\nMoving on to the characters\\, the gang is back from The Force Awakens and they are still pretty much the same people.  Character development is obviously a class that all the writers conveniently slept through due to a particularly rough party the previous night.  Instead they decided to make their characters amazing the first time round so they would never have to change them in any way and everyone would still be happy\\, which seems to have worked because I still love them.\\n\\nFin continues to do jump rope with the line between cowardice and extreme bravery.  Po is hilarious as ever and also still a hot head which everyone still wants a piece of including perhaps an up and coming Jedi and no I'm not talking about Luke\\, by the way\\, that isn't a spoiler\\, more like a prediction.  Kylo Ren or Ben Solo\\, *Facepalm*\\, Ok I can do this.  Kylo is a guy who desperately tries to be bad but most of the time ends up just being ba...  I'm not saying he isn't strong and I'm not saying that he hasn't done some bad things but he only does those things when he gets really angry.  I could turn him to the light side with a cup of herbal tea and some soothing music.  The new guy or preferably the OG\\, is Luke\\, and his is a story that has been told almost too many times before: Old man with ancient knowledge is asked to train bright eyed new girl\/guy.  He doesn't want to.  New girl persists until old man gives in.  New girl is surprisingly good\\, which makes you wonder why she even needed a teacher in the first place.  There's more to it than that but that's the gist.  But I'm not going to criticise Mark Hamil because I really thought he did a great job\\, the only disappointing part was that we didn't get to see more of him showing off his powers.\\n\\nI'm going to need a new paragraph for Rey\\, so here goes.  She is still strong willed\\, still doesn't give up and is still too good with the Force.  But she is still a down to earth relatable\\, funny character that - for the first time in Hollywood - isn't over sexualised.  Will she show up in a golden bikini in the next movie\\, I don't know and I also don't know how I'd feel about it?  The most disappointing scene from Rey was when her hand wasn't cut off in any of the scenes\\, I mean isn't that what we all came to see.  But I digress\\, on an infinitely better note\\, as these movies progress it seems like Rey is becoming more and more of a total badass and I fully expect some incredible fight scenes from her in the next one.  \\n\\nIn conclusion\\, do I think you should go watch the movie?...Yes of course\\, its Star Wars\\, even if you don't like it\\, in thirty years time you can tell your children that you were there when it came out\\, like our parents did to us and I don't know about you\\, but I intend to keep milking that cow until blue milk stops coming out.","true":true}
