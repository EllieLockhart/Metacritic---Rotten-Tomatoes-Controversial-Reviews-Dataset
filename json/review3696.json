Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Better than Ep 7\\, a good Star Wars action. Had lightsaber fights and space battles. Acting was better in this one. Beautiful effects and amazing musical score. Makes me want to see Ep 9 to see where the story goes\\, leaves with a number of questions and lots of room for debate and discussion. Had a number of twists and surprises I didn't see coming","true":true}
