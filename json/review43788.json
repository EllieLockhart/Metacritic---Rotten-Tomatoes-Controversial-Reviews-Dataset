Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the worst starwars movie to date.\\n\\nThere are so many things wrong with this movie I think it's a sin to call in starwars.\\n\\n45 minutes of this movie is wasted on two characters running around on some random planet accomplishing absolutely nothing.\\n\\nI feel like the director hasnt even watched starwars.  Luke Skywalkers character was destroyed in this film.\\n\\nLuke was a whiney bum the felt sorry for himself throughout the entire movie.  \\n\\nfor instance\\, Luke who wouldn't kill Darth Vader (who killed hundreds of people) because he felt good in him\\, decided it was a good idea to kill his nephew because he was getting too powerful???????? \\n\\nLuke who defeated darth vader can't defeat a young girl who has 0 training at all?????\\n\\nI was hoping the action would save this movie but there wasn't any good action in the entire film.","true":true}
