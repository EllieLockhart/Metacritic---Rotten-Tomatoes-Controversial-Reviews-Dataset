Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very simple: \\\"Empire Strikes Back\\\" is at the top. And right below it is \\\"The Last Jedi\\\"!!! In my humble opinion; This was so satisfying\\, so gratifying\\, and just amazing!! This time around\\, I decided to stay away from all the spoilers and rumors (I should've done that with \\\"Force Awakens\\\" and \\\"Rogue One\\\") and went in as a fan of the franchise\\, but more importantly as a fan of Movies in general. I'm not a critic nor an \\\"expert\\\" but I can tell you that Rian Johnson did a hell of a job!!!! It was a rollercoaster of emotions!! Hopefully J.J. Abrams will pick up where Rian left off and end the Skywalker saga with a bang!!! The franchise is in good hands\\, Rian Johnson just gave us a taste of what his \\\"New Trilogy\\\" is gonna be like. But don't take my word for it\\, nor the negative reviews either.....GO SEE IT!!!!!!!!","true":true}
