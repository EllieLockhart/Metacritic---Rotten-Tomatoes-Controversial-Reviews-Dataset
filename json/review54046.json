Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I could not believe the critic reviews when I first saw them. I went to watch The Last Jedi without any spoilers and got away with watching only one trailer prior to initial and ONLY viewing. And I must say\\, this was a total disappointment. Now I'm sure Rian Johnson is a talented director\\, I mean\\, I liked Looper and oh\\, what else did he do? Exactly my point...not all directors can transition from making a small budget film to over a $250 million movie. Even so\\, he should've applied his new take in the universe in a different Star Wars story (like the trilogy he's probably not getting now) and not completely destroy the lore of the saga films. I\\, like many\\, waited over 30 years for the continuation of the original trilogy and with The Force Awakens\\, not the best movie\\, but at least we had a foot in the right direction. We had interesting new characters\\, great cgi\\, spectacular cinematography and they even brought back the original cast members. \\nNow here enter Rian Johnson and Disney. I'm not even sure who's more to blame. After doing a little research\\, I find out Rian was not only the directory but also the screenwriter. Yeah\\, I know\\, Disney still has final say. But most reports say this was his baby.\\nI won't go into spoilers because if you're like me you will go and see for yourself. Heck\\, you might even like it. Highly unlikely\\, as you can see by my rating and the general movie going audience\\, this was not a good film. In fact\\, the only scene I did enjoy was in the throne room. You'll know when you see it. But 1 good scene does not make an overall good movie.\\nMy final recommendation\\, if you don't mind getting your heart crushed...rent it when it comes out on video.","true":true}
