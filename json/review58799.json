The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Let me start off by saying that I\\, like many here was a huge fan of the first game. I have been looking forward to this game for years and avoided any spoilers that came out. With that said\\, The Last of Us Part 2 is a beautiful looking game\\, the graphics\\, environments\\, and fight sections are extremely well done. The Flashbacks with Ellie and Joel were great\\, especially the museum sequence. The voice acting is also great for the most part. HOWEVER\\, this games biggest downfall is it\u2019s pacing\\, the story absolutely fails to make you sympathize with Abby after she murders Joel. Which in its own right doesn\u2019t even make much sense with how it happens\\, but I digress. The fact that the game constantly pulls you out of climax moments for flashbacks just completely takes away from the pacing of the story. By the time I played Abbys half of the story and was seeing her flashbacks with the WLF and Owen and Mel\\, I found myself really disconnected because I had already killed them as Ellie several hours before. It would have made more sense to me to play as Abby first\\, or at least play as Ellie for a day and then Abby. I completely understand why Abby killed Joel\\, was it justified? In this world I\u2019d say yeah probably\\, Joel killed plenty of people for less\\, however if you\u2019re going to do that and then make me play as his killer you\u2019ve got to set it up in a better way than was shown here. The supporting characters were all fine\\, none of them really seemed to be given much time to shine though\\, I did really like Jesse and Dina and even Owen\\, but again\\, really hard to connect with him when I knew he was already dead. Lev and Yara were also fine\\, but not given a ton to do\\, you go on a fetch quest to save Yara that took an hour only for her to die almost immediately after so that was fun. I also think the ending was way too drawn out\\, I\u2019m not even upset Ellie didn\u2019t kill Abby in the end\\, although I think it probably would\u2019ve made more sense. But introducing a whole new faction at the end of the game and fighting through hordes of them just to save Abby to fight her\\, when for all Ellie knows she\u2019s already dead just didn\u2019t make much sense to me.  Anyway in conclusion\\, I don\u2019t think this is the worst game ever made\\, not at all\\, this game does some things so right\\, but the pacing of the story make it such a slog to play at times. In the end I probably won\u2019t replay this one\\, but if you catch a good sale it\u2019s worth checking out at least for the gameplay.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
