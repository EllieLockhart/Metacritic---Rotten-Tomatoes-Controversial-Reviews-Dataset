Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible. Lore breaking and character disgracing. Slow speed chase in space?Who is Snoke? Rose is an awful character that takes up way too much screen time. Makes a far reaching feminist statement but ends up making female leadership seem incompetent; resulting in mega cringe. This film is awful and disjointed\\, offers no follow up from TFA... it just doesn't make any sense. Sure the visuals were good but the planet\\, Kanto Bit\\, looks awful. Do not watch this movie; instead\\, take your children to a park\\, call your mother or just close your eyes and take a nap.  Brace yourself for severe disappointment that reaches new lows.","true":true}
