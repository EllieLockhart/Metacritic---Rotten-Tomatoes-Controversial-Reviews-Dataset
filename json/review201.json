Yakuza 0 is bonkers\\, pulp nonsense. And it is downright artistic more often than not. While not truly an open world game - it's often very linear\\, the game delights more with the details and side activities than with the overall game design. There may be a peppering of long in the tooth JRPG random battles as you walk through the streets. There may be Guitar Hero style karaoke sing alongs. And there may be button mashing combat encounters\\, all of which you may have seen hundreds of times in dozens in other games\\, but none with the dry humor or atmosphere of Yakuza. I could make a list of all the small frustrations you could encounter in the game too\\, but this game is almost above any sort of focused criticism. Yakuza is just a good time and it maybe even one of the best gangster tales told in the last 15 years too.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
