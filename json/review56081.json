Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Somehow\\, this movie makes die-hard Star Wars fans feel as if the prequels weren't that bad because they at least felt like Star Wars movies. Instead of being given a Star Wars movie\\, we were all given a MARVEL movie\\, but with the a Star Wars intro\\, and based in space. Although 'The Force Awakens' wasn't my favourite movie\\, I really feel it set up for a brilliant second movie in this new trilogy\\, with mysteries and unfinished subplots to be explored\\, but clearly Rian Johnson forgot about 'The Force Awakens'\\, and for that matter the rest of Star Wars\\, and wrote the kind of stand alone\\, high budget film you would find on netflix\\, and not a film with 7 other movies (8 counting 'Rogue One') leading up to it.\\n\\nLuke Skywalker's character was a shambles\\, behaving nothing like what Luke used to act like. Luke used to be the guy who fought his own father to turn him to the light side of the force once again\\, and restore peace to the galaxy. But now is seams upset\\, childish\\, and is unwilling to even try to help Rey out of fear of the Jedi order being reborn.\\n\\nI could go on forever about how many things were forgotten\\, changed\\, and subsequently ruined\\, but I think my star rating says it all. A good movie\\, but not a good Star Wars movie. If there weren't 8 other Star Wars movies\\, some tv shows and a whole extended universe that has shaped the universe in which this movie takes place\\, this would be great\\, but there is a lot for this movie to live up to\\, and it failed to do so.","true":true}
