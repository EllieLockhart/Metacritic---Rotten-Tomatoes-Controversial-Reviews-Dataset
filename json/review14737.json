Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have no idea why there are so many bad reviews\\, the movie wasn\u2019t perfect but it was far from bad. I thought it was actually quite good. The purpose of the movie was to effect change and to set up the final conflict in episode 9 and I think it accomplished its goals admirably. ","true":true}
