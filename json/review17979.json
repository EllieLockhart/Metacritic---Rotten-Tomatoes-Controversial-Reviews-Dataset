Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think people just want what they want. Or\\, they have no idea what they want. There are a lot of information and development of the new characters but it is really hard to see them if you watch it only once. I find many reviews very biased and they don't know what they are talking about. Period","true":true}
