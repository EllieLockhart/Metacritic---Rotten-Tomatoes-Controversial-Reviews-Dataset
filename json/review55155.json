Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went back to see this a second time\\, before formulating an opinion\\, because I was so conflicted at first. - After much thought\\, this just did not work.  Cliff notes:\\n\\n1) They tried to make Luke \\\"Logan\\\"\\, but Star Wars is not X-Men\\, and Luke is not Logan. There is now ay that this character we've grown with in 1977 would ever behave the way he did in almost all of the scenes in this movie. - What a tragic\\, tragic way to end Luke Skywalker\\, son of \\\"The Chosen One...who was supposed to bring balance to the force\\\".  -- Luke would never be a coward like this. If anything\\, Luke should have flown Red5 (shown in the water at the island) to fight in person\\, instead of dying while floating on a rock\\n\\n2) Snoke - Who is Snoke? We still don't know. He was powerful enough to overturn the entire Rebellion\/New Order that was built over 3 movies\\, in between moves 7 and 8. Now the Rebels are down only several dozen and almost extinct? Because of Snoke? -- And he's defeated by Kylo\\, who lost to Rey\\, the first time she held a lightsaber.\\n\\n3) The Prophecy of the Chosen one is meaningless? - Vader had no known father. He didn't bring balance to the force\\, so we can only assume Luke\/Leia will do this. They do\\, but then it's undone by some random bad guy that shows up for less than one move (see #2). Now Luke's dead\\, Leia dies in 9\\, and Rey's not related to Luke. - Vader's Chosen One prophecy which spawned the story of Star Wars is now meaningless.\\n\\nThis isn't Star Wars. This is Di$ney setting up a platform to soap opera new characters for decades to come\\, instead of telling the real story.","true":true}
