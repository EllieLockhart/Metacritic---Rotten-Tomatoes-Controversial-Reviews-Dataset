Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i thought this movie was quite good. the dialogue was witty at times and emotionally gripping at times. The use of the force was done much better then the prequels (jibberish about midichlorians) and the original trilogy (magic an old man can do which is never really explained). \\n\\nI also thought when Leia travelled to the ship using the force was very entertaining and well-needed in the star wars anthology as leia using force was a concept meant to be used in the empire strikes back.talking about the empire strikes back\\, i thought the movie was more original compared to the force awakens. rose was also a good character; i hope she survives and is a character in episode IX. luke's conclusion was dramtic and one of the best star wars moments.\\n\\ni don't  get the hate this film has been getting. it was a solid addition to the ever-growing Star wars anthology; in my opinion it was better then the force awakens. also porgs!","true":true}
