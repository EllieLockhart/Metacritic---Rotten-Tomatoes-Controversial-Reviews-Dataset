Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think it may be the best of the 8 mainframe films. Tossup between \\\"Strikes Back\\\" and this. Daisy is amazing. Laura Dern is a great addition and Mark Hamill gives what is probably the best ever performance in any Stars Wars movie. A lovely last movie for Carrie Fisher as well.","true":true}
