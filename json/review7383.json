Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"ESTA PEL\u00cdCULA ES UN INSULTO AL ESPECTADOR\\, UN INSULTO AL LEGADO DEL CANON ORIGINAL. ESTO ES UN INSULTO A LA TRIOLOGIA ORINAL.
