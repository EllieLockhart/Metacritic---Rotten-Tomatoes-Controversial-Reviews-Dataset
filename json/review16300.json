Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not quite sure why the large gap exists between critics and regular moviegoers\\, but I thought Episode VIII was excellent. I suppose to a purist\\, the Luke Skywalker story in this particular film is not ideal\\, but it's time to step out of the stone age and into 21st century cinema. The franchise is setup for many years to come\\, and that can't happen with aging characters. ","true":true}
