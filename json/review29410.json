Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson directed a awesome film...  I would give it an 8 out of 10 but there are so many negative dark side reviews- (the film definitely doesn't deserve a zero) I need to balance out the negativity.  It kind of had a mix of old films and the prequels.   It kind of had a mix of old films and the prequels.  Great twist\\, turns and fun.  Not what I was expecting.  (which might be where bigot negativity comes from\\, ).  Look forward to Episode IX","true":true}
