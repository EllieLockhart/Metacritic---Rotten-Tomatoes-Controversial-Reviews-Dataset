Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Basically the acting\\, casting and how most scenes were shot were very well done. However the writing for the mechanic in particular is pretty poor as she is introduced one way but then is nothing like that for the rest of the film.\\nA lot of the film feels like unecessary filler and the handling of characters such as Snoke and Rey's parents was sub-par. We have never before seen the need for a hacker to get past a ships security\\, nevermind a master hacker\\, this makes the casino feel like even more filler than it was. It would have made more sense to have had to infiltrate a first order base to get the necesarry codes to land uninterrupted (similar to rogue one's discrete landing on the imperial planet).\\nThere is a distinct lack of tension in the main chase of First Order after the Rebels as they keep saying they are low on fuel but clearly multiple days pass during the chasr making it feel less urgent.\\nThe mechanics decision to intercept Finn's attempt at destroying *spoiler* seemed uncalled for\\, uneccesary\\, and and excuse for there to be a need for *spoiler* as Finn had plenty of time to destroy it.\\nOverall while the acting and shooting (of scenes)  was all amazing it suffered from large amounts of filler\\, mediocre writing and mishandling of characters. Also\\, pet peeve. When Kylo Ren is fighting it feels like he prioritses killing the floor and walls over his actual enemies.","true":true}
