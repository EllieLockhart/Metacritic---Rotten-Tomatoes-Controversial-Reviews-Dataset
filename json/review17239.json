Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really put thought into this one before I reviewed it. The Last Jedi is honestly a really good movie that gets dragged down by issues that were more than avoidable. The character Rose is just done terribly in this movie. She was an awful presence on screen and could have easily been taken out of the movie. The plot with her and Finn where they went to a Vegas like planet was absolutely pointless\\, stupid\\, and unnecessary. The action and the cinematography were all excellent in this movie. The cast from the previous movies were all done really well. The movie also had various twists and turns and I was frequently surprised. Overall\\, I thought it was a fun ride but just a few major things that dragged the movie down","true":true}
