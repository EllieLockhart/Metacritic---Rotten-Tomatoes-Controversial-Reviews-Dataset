Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie had some great moments to be sure and I don't want to take that from the film. But a lot of those moments where undercut by forced jokes or just removing all the impact of it's scenes. For example there's one scene near the beginning that was incredible and impactful but is then immediately reversed resulting in a hollow 'gotcha' moment. All in all it felt emotionless.","true":true}
