Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILER WARNING: The following review contains spoilers for Star Wars: The Last Jedi.\\n\\nHopefully\\, you have all had the opportunity to see The Last Jedi in theaters. If not\\, I suggest you go see it once or twice before reading this review. I'm not going to lie\\, the first time I saw this film I had no idea what to think of it. I didn't know if I liked it or hated it. In fact\\, there were even moments that I felt it completely ruined Star Wars. Going into this film\\, my expectations were my worst enemy. For two years\\, I formulated theories in my mind about who Snoke was and who I thought Rey's parents were. I imagined Luke Skywalker igniting his green lightsaber and taking down the Knights of Ren. I thought all of my burning questions introduced by The Force Awakens would be answered. How did Kylo Ren get Vader's helmet? How did Maz Kanata get Luke's lightsaber? However\\, as Luke so perfectly stated\\, \\\"this is not going to go the way you think.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first time I saw the film\\, I was enjoying it for the most part\\, but then Snoke was cut in half halfway through the film and my brain shut off. I could not enjoy or appreciate anything that happened after that because everything I thought I knew about Star Wars had been suddenly shattered. Immediately following that\\, it was revealed that Rey's parents were nobody and all my hopes of her being a Skywalker or Kenobi were stomped on. Then\\, in the finale of the film\\, my favorite hero of all time (Luke Skywalker) confronted Kylo Ren and the First Order and I thought all would be set right. But then in another of Rian Johnson's cruel jokes\\, Luke wasn't even really there and he died shortly after. I felt as if Rian Johnson was sticking a middle finger right in my face and laughing at me for all the hopes I had for this film. I was filled with anger and disappointment as I walked out of the theater. I felt an empty feeling\\, as if all hope had been lost for my favorite film franchise. And let's face it\\, for millions of people (including me) Star Wars is more than just a series of films; it is a way of life. It is something to be anticipated and celebrated; it removes us from our daily lives and allows us to be filled with hope\\, excitement\\, and wonder. How could Rian Johnson do this?\\n\\n\\n\\nLike many other diehard fans\\, I could have gotten on Rotten Tomatoes and torn the film apart and given it a negative review. Don't get me wrong\\, I completely understand the criticism and I had the same initial reaction\\, but I knew I wasn't ready to write a review yet. I instantly knew that this was a film that affected me in a way that no other film has; it truly challenged me. If Rian Johnson did nothing else with this film\\, he certainly took The Force and the franchise to a whole new level and made many bold choices. Last night\\, after reading many interviews with Rian about his choices in The Last Jedi\\, I went into the film with a new perspective because we all know that Star Wars relies heavily on a certain point of view. I am so thankful that I saw this film with a more open mind and new eyes because it genuinely blew me away. I agree with George Lucas\\, this is a beautifully made film. The Last Jedi can certainly be taken at face value and has enough laughs and action to make some viewers happy\\, but this is a film with so many layers. This film is loaded with foreshadowing and connections that I did not see the first time around. After a second viewing\\, not only is this a great film in its own right\\, but it is a fantastic Star Wars film.\\n\\nWhen it comes to the performances in the Last Jedi\\, Rian Johnson has found a way to bring out the best in every actor in the film. Each character is given a moment to shine\\, including the droids. R2-D2\\, though used minimally\\, has a very poignant and nostalgic scene with Luke that gives him the push he needs to teach Rey about The Force. The banter directed at C-3PO by Leia and Poe is perfect here\\, and very reminiscent of The Empire Strikes Back. BB-8 also has some great moments both in the cockpit of Poe's X-Wing and on board Snoke's ship. Speaking of Poe\\, I loved his character and development as a character in this film. To me\\, he is the Han Solo of this new generation of films\\, but is also being groomed as a leader by Leia. The buddy chemistry between Finn and Poe is also great\\, but I do hope John Boyega has a larger role in Episode IX because his character grows immensely in this film\\, despite his minimized role. Carrie Fisher gives a great final performance as Leia in this film\\, and her use of The Force and reunion with Luke give the perfect sendoff to the character. While the supporting actors do a fantastic job\\, it is the three leads that impress the most. This film is truly about the characters of Luke\\, Kylo Ren\\, and Rey\\, and it is their story that we care the most about. Adam Driver does a phenomenal job of creating a conflicted villain that can be sympathized with; this is not your typical one dimensional bad guy. Daisy Ridley once again does an amazing job with the character of Rey and is the true hero of the film. However\\, it is Mark Hamill who absolutely knocks it out of the park as Luke. This is the best performance of the film and I feel that he truly deserves an Oscar nomination.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi is not a perfect film\\, and many divisive decisions are made by Rian Johnson. However\\, this film is filled with laughs and so many great moments that are nostalgic\\, but also fresh and new. In my opinion\\, The Last Jedi has the best opening of all the Star Wars films to date. The opening space battle is amazing and immediately pulls you into the action and sets the tone for the rest of the film. The moments between Rey and Luke on Ahch-To are some of my favorite scenes in all of Star Wars\\, and way The Force is explored and expanded upon is fantastic. Midway through the film\\, we are treated to one of the best fight scenes I have ever seen when Rey and Kylo take on the Praetorian Guards in Snoke's throne room. One of the best treats we get in The Last Jedi is The Force Ghost of Yoda\\, who appears to Luke at the time of his greatest need to impart one final lesson about failure. I loved the fact that Rian Johnson and company recreated the puppet used in the original trilogy for Yoda in this film. Near the end of the film\\, we finally get to see the reunion of Luke and Leia in a scene that brought tears to my eyes. And Luke's final moments could not have been more perfect\\, as his story both begins and ends with him gazing upon the setting twin suns.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith my first viewing of The Last Jedi\\, I realized that the film did not meet my expectations. However\\, upon a second viewing\\, it was clear to me that this film exceeded my expectations and Rian Johnson came up with something that was far better than I could have imagined in my own mind. I now realize that Luke's sacrifice was far more powerful than him cutting down some fools with a laser sword. The legend of Luke Skywalker may have caused him to fail with Kylo Ren\\, but as Yoda says\\, \\\"our greatest teacher\\, failure is.\\\" It is Luke's legend and sacrifice that has given hope to a new rebellion\\, and he will not be the last Jedi. I now see that it is more significant for Rey to be no one and to earn her own place in this galaxy\\, as opposed to being from a line of powerful force users. Rian made many bold choices\\, and not all of them landed perfectly\\, but he has created a Star Wars film that should be viewed multiple times and can be dissected and enjoyed for years to come. Rian has already taught me so many lessons through this film\\, and has subverted expectations in a way that can allow us to enjoy a new generation of films without relying on comparisons to what came before. The Last Jedi is a fantastic Star Wars film that is brilliant on its own\\, but also sets the stage for a new generation of films and Jedi. There is a new hope...\\n\\nStar Wars: The Last Jedi has earned a Rausch Rating of 9 out of 10","true":true}
