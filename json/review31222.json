Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many plot holes\\, so many dumb writing decisions. This movie was contrived\\, tried too hard to be funny (when it really should have taken a more serious tone)\\, and just... bad. Bad writing. Bad directing.","true":true}
