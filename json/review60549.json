It is not pushing any kind of agenda for people literally existing in a post apocalyptic game..Game and theme of vengeance was handled really well. Conflict was definitely present and showed repercussions of seeking vengeance from using Ellie to show conquest to achieve that goal and Abby as showing the aftereffect of completing vengeance and the void it creates after obsession of something for years.. it was foreshadowed hard in beginning of game during Joel song \\\" if I lost you\\, I'd surely lose myself\\\". Which is exactly happened to both characters. Game was superb to me. Of course it can have subjective criticism for how the gameplay and pacing can effect your experience but existence of lesbian or trans character shouldn't be a crutch for a problem in game. Just saying.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
