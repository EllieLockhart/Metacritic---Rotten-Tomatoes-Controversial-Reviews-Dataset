Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"incoherent plot with bland characters. No struggle for Rey\\, no respect for previous cannon or characters past. it completely rewrites the personality of characters like luke without context or reason. It is like Rian never even watched the previous movies before making this one.","true":true}
