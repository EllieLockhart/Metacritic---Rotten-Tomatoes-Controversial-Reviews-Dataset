Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left the cinema very disappointed and conflicted after seeing TLJ. A few days of introspection and I decided I really disliked the movie\\, bordering on hating the movie. I don't hate it but I do hate Rian Johnson and Disney for this movie and what it has done to the Star Wars.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi will be my last new Star Wars movie that I ever watch ever again. It has ended my Star Wars saga and I refuse to acknowledge it as part of the canon along with The Force Awakens which wasn't a great movie but I enjoyed it enough to really look forward to TLJ. I will from this day forward only watch the Original Trilogy as it is the only Star Wars that matters to me.\\n\\nGood work Rian \/ Disney\\, you f##ked it all up for what? To reinvent Star Wars as a corporate SJW version that is a shell. It looks and sounds like Star Wars but it's soul has been sucked out and buried.","true":true}
