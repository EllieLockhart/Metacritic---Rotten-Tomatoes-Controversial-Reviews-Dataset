Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst movie ever. They KILLED Star Wars. Honestly\\, do? t watch it\\, you will be so disapointed. Disney might have the money to buy the critics opinion\\, but they ca?t buy me. So\\, the truth is: Horrible Movie! They did this on purpose :-( ... a slap in the face to us all.","true":true}
