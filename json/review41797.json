Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is riddled with plot holes. The characters are written badly. This is by far the worst film in the saga. Don't waste your time or your money on this one. And don't take the 5 star reviews seriously either. The critics score is laughable and speaks to the fact that they don't want to lose their access by posting a negative review.","true":true}
