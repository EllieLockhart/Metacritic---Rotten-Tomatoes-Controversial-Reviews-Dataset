Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For this movie to have a 93 from critics is proof that critics are sell outs.  For this movie to as horrible as it is in every way\\, and to have this high of a score is proof that money is more important than integrity.  Well duh I guess.  A couple critics said this movie is as good as Empire.....?  pffft I cant even think that sentence with a straight face.  What a joke.  This movie is not only horrible\\, it destroys the original trilogy.  Apparently Luke Skywalker was not what we thought he was\\, because he is pathetic in this movie.  The force has been twisted into an ability you learn at hogwarts and \\\"Supreme Leader\\\" snoke has power ranger throw away villains as body guards\\, complete with ninja poses.  I am done with this trilogy and as far as I am concerned it is not cannon.  Rogue One to Episode 6 thats it thats all.  I hope you make a lot of money disney\\, then use it to bribe critics for good reviews.","true":true}
