Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was well written for the most part\\, well directed\\, and it definitely had some amazing action sequences. The score is incredible\\, but who would expect anything less from Williams? The man is a musical genius.\\n  I like the new characters\\, but I was pretty disappointed in the direction they decided to take Luke Skywalker's character. For a company (Disney) that doesn't take too many risks with their tentpole franchises\\, including their superhero films\\, I find it rather odd that they chose this route for one of the most iconic characters\\, if not THE most iconic character\\, in all of the Star Wars Saga.  Without spoiling anything\\, I expected a lot more out of Luke's interaction\/relationship with Rey\\, and the climatic ending involving Luke was pretty underwhelming and unsatisfactory to say the least.  It baffles me to hear people say this is the greatest Star Wars film ever. When I hear this\\, all I can think is \\\"when is the last time you saw Star Wars or the Empire Strikes Back?\\\" This film isn't even close. In fact\\, I don't even like this one as much as Rogue One.","true":true}
