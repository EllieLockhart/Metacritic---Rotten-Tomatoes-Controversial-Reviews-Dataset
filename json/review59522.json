The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The game is good\\, graphics are good\\, storyline - not really\\, but you need to dive into it to understand it fully\\, even replay the first one - The Last of Us\/The Last of Us Remastered. Now\\, what I want to tell about people that rate from 0 to 3. I understand how this game could get 0\/1\/2\/3 because of Joel and storyline\\, but think about other things about the game. Why would you rate 0\\, that just means: graphics are bad\\, storyline is bad\\, the whole game is just bad. Maybe at least a 5 or 6? Or even a 4? Because while I was reading 0 ones\\, I saw that you said only - everything is bad. You did like the graphics didn't you? Some of the moments are fantastic and some of them explain why this person did that or this. Some of the parts also show you how did they get this hatred and wanting for a revenge\\, for someone they loved\\, for example Abby or Ellie. I understand about many beloved characters dying\\, Joel\\, Tommy\\, Jessie\\, but this game expresses how hatred can take over a person\\, just after realising\\, it's not the way to do it. Basically what I mean\\, is that you need to look up in the Internet what's this game all about. As said\\, hatred and love. You can get confused on it\\, but you will understand it later on.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
