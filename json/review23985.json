Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Many people are saying that this movie is not a Star Wars movie\\, but I disagree. Things change with time. Characters aren't static. If all the characters from the OT hadn't changed at all as they grew old\\, that would be pretty dumb. This movie had some good action\\, scenes\\, and story beats\\, but it was bogged down a bit by some characters from the last movie that didn't really need to be in this one and some spots where the humor was kind of tonally unaware.","true":true}
