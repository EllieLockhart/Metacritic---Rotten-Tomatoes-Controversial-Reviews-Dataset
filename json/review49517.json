Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow didn't realise I was watching a comedy\\, yes you can add jokes here and there but every scene? Gets repetitive especially with a matured audience...wait that's right Disney bought rights so they can chop and change where they feel necessary to gain more revenue via marketing\\, merchandising etc. I went into to this movie with high expectations for Luke returning (my fault) and they (in my opinion) did NOT deliver. That's why I'm giving it a half star\\, a few great scenes with a lot of (different) woman crying. Many unanswered questions left from Force Awakens still unanswered in Last Jedi. Welcome to the new Stars Wars franchise\\, thank you Disney!","true":true}
