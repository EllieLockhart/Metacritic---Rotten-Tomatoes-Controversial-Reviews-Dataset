Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall this movie just makes me angry. It betrays Luke\u2019s character\\, while showing a pointless side quest with Rose (one of the worst characters in Star Wars) while some ships slowly chase each other in space. The only redeeming parts are the relationships between Rey and Kylo\\, and the throne room scene. ","true":true}
