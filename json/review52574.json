Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A literally perfect movie. Takes everything you think is going to happen and throws it on its head in a way that makes complete sense for the story and furthers the saga in the most interesting way possible. Literally my only complaint is that astral projection Luke uses Anakin's lightsaber\\, giving away that twist. The only reason I place this (just barely) under Empire is because Han\\, Boba\\, and Vader aren't in it. The best Star Wars movie since 1980.","true":true}
