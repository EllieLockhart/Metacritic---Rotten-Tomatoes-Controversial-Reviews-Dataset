Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An explosive addition to the lore. \\n\\nThe last Jedi dared in many ways\\, go where other Star Wars didn't. And that pissed many off. \\nThe intelligent use of lore\\, bold decisions with the characters and parallels with the current political climate make this entry to franchise one of the most relevant since its creation.\\n\\nThe characters are vivid and complex\\, with the odd exception of phasma. The focus on the new generation is divisive but ultimately makes sense. The plot turns help break the monotony of a predictable outcome and invigorate the main characters in new directions. \\n\\nUltimately this fresh take on a cultural colossus will always stand out\\, even facing the hatred.","true":true}
