Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie itself was consistent with it's predecessors in the trilogy\\, but failed to add anything to the franchise. It took a great hero\\, like Luke Skywalker\\, and tried to turn him into a bitter old man. Other than the Ray\/Luke tangent; the film it's self tried to fit too much in\\, leaving out a lot of character development. Overall\\, I think the credibility of this film is level with the original trilogy in the early 2000s.","true":true}
