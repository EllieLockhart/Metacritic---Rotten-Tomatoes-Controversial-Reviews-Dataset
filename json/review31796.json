Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spaceballz : the last jedi.\\n\\nThis wasnt a Star Wars movie. Stop mangling Luke and making him suck milk out of some alien cows tits. Snoke wasnt explained and killed in a lame way. This was a travestry of the Star Wars legacy. Lame lightsaber fight\\, Darth Maul vs Jedi in phantom menace was light years away much better. Rey is is inexplicably can handle a kylo ren whos been trained since childhood by luke!!!\\n\\nDisney ruined and mangled the soul of Star Wars. Bring George Lucas back to save episode 9.","true":true}
