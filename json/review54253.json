Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you want to see marvel meets Star Wars this is the film for you. Same stupid unneeded jokes injected in the movie. Terribly written\\, the pace feels off. Luke isn't done justice in my opinion.  Dumb decisions by what should be smart characters. The new characters introduced are just terrible\\, i have no idea why even put them in there. Rose and Finn narrative just needs to be gone. \\nDisney succeeded in killing off pretty much all the original characters before the trilogy is even done. This should have been the final trilogy of the true Star Wars characters with an introduction to the new characters sprinkled in. \\nLastly Rey is a terrible character\\, over powered super Jedi. Luke has to learn and struggles to move large objects as he learns of the force. Rey can move hundreds of heavy rocks without blinking. It's just terrible.","true":true}
