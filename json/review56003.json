Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Should be called STAR WARS: Deus Ex Machina.  \\n  \\n\\nWith this episode\\, Star Wars as we know and love it is now completely dead. Explosions\\, action scenes and impassioned speeches abound\\, but you'd be hard pressed to find a point for any of it. Many scenes seem to be paying homage to iconic scenes from the original trilogy\\, but recreating the form without retaining the spirit and purpose makes those scenes seem more like cheap imitations instead.  \\n\\nOn top of all that\\, there is simply no sense of actual tension or urgency in this movie. Characters seem to make decisions based not on the needs of the situation they're in\\, but on how flashy\\, dramatic\\, or touching they can make their situation look in front of an audience. It's jarring\\, and makes it very apparent that we are being served something on a big screen in 2017 USA instead of being pulled in to a galaxy far\\, far away.   \\n\\nThere were a few good scenes here and there\\, and a few poignant moments as well. Unfortunately\\, for the majority of the movie you're just left wondering\\, \\\"but why though?\\\" It's sad to say\\, but this is easily the worst Star Wars movie to date.","true":true}
