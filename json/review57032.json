Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film gets points for being well crafted on a technical level.  Visually\\, it looks pretty (not beautiful but pretty).  Unfortunately\\, the poor jokes and flaccid dialogue ruins any tension it tries to build.\\n\\nWhat really destroys the film for me\\, however\\, is that it doesn't advance the plot anywhere.  Most of the film is spent on a starship and the rest is spent doing nothing meaningful on the ground.  There's no active role for the characters caught up in those moments.  They simply talk and nothing more.  At its core\\, it mirrors Empire Strikes Back but with ESB\\, the characters play an active role in moving around Echo Base\\, dodging Star Destroyers and TIE fighters\\, and walking around Cloud City until getting capture.  Meanwhile\\, the Jedi in training rushes back to save the day only to fail.\\n\\nThe dialogue advances the plot rather than serving as filler.  New things are learned\\, different character traits are added together\\, and plenty of twists occur.  That's an adventure right there and that's how character development is created.\\n\\nThis film lacks the same ingredients as its predecessor.  That's why it can mirror ESB but not capture any of its magic.  Essentially\\, a skilled chef can only do so much with a $10 steak.","true":true}
