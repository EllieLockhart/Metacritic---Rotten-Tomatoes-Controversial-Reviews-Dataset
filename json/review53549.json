Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Every scene from the very beginning felt underwhelming. It wasn't terrible\\, but it just didn't deliver like it could have. There was too much humour\\, and while it was appropriate humour for a Star Wars film\\, it doesn't need to be in every single scene.\\nThere is also a very obvious break in artistic vision between The Force Awakens and the Last Jedi\\, with this director taking the story and characters in a very different direction than was expected. I don't call this kind of thing a twist... it's just simply a surprise that we didn't need.\\nIf I could change one thing only\\, I'd change the entire middle side-story with the Casino planet; yeah that's really a lot of things but it's a story arch that made no sense and contributed absolutely nothing to the film except to annoy me with Star Wars Prequel flashbacks.","true":true}
