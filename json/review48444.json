Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"without doubt the worst  SW movie ever made. Unbelievably bad story\\, unbalanced \\, cringworthy is some parts and the Anti-trump SJW narrative throughout the movie was nothing short of insulting to the SW legacy. I  Have seen the movie x 3 in a hope it might get better but  its only confirmed how completely rubbish it is.  Rian Johnson and Disney have stated they want to take SW in a different direction but I think thats a  Copout \\, they have simply made a crap movie using a crap storyline . For the first time in 40years I wont be paying to go see a SW movie when Ep9 is released. As a result my kids are no longer interested in SW so the 'legacy' stops at EP8 for our family.","true":true}
