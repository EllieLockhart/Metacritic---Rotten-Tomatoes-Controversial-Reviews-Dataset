Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Growing up I was a HUGE (some would say annoying) Star Wars fan and this the message that I got from the writers of this Film 'Hey 40 something year old geek\\, shouldn't you be doing your taxes or something??? Just an FYI - We don't want or need your patronage or fanfare any longer because\\, this ain't your Daddy's Star Wars!!!  No sir\\, in fact we pride ourselves in eliminating everything that made this franchise successful which includes: crapping on your favorite characters\\, breaking all the 'force-rules' established before 2015 and basically injecting so much politics into the script that you'll think you're watching the SNL. Which brings me to the 'comedy'\\, you won't understand the sophisticated humor of this film because you're too old and out of touch. Also\\, we appreciate you not looking at this film as a story but more a long rudderless music video based on the destruction of your childhood.  Also don't question how Rey can wield the force without training ya old fuddy-duddy\\, just accept that she's effing awesome and was born with her magical powers.  Kind of like that baby from the Incredibles. So deal with it!!!  Also\\, never you mind the plot holes the size of your receding hairline and how people can seemingly teleport\\, can't a movie just be a movie?  Why do you have use your frontal lobe at all when watching this masterpiece?  Just focus on the bright lights\\, sounds FX and shiny stuff... that's right let your cerebellum be your guide ya big turd. Anyway\\, hope you're excited for the next one!\\\"  Yep... that's pretty what I got out of this film.  Now I understand why Luke just evaporated like that\\, he's like 'Calgon take me away'. btw - that's a joke so take that ya whipper-snappers!!!","true":true}
