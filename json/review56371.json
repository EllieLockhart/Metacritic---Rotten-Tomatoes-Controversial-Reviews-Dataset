Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible. Snoke\u2019s purpose was never defined and was setup to be too powerful to die as quickly and carelessly as he did. Kylo has the attitude of a 10 year old boy who just sh*t his pants on the playground. The once respectable Empire\/First Order had no identity. Luke\\, whom this movie was supposedly centered around\\, would\u2019ve had a more important role if he were a tree. Leia is a wizard. Rey is the most powerful Jedi without training to be a Jedi. Yoda\u2019s brief expose was irrelevant to the story. Above all\\, lackluster\/short-lived action scenes and it felt as if the movie were directed by kids playing with toys during recess... The movie had a few moments of grandeur\\, but where it lacked in tradition and empirical relevancy it made up for in cartoony plot lines and inconceivable \u201cWTF just happened\u201d moments. Disappointed is putting it lightly. ","true":true}
