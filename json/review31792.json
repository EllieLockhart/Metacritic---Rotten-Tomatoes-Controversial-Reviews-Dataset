Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So with Rian we get\\, a coward Luke\\, gravity in space\\, drag in space\\, hyperspace weapons\\, and a terrible Rey lineage.  Oh\\, and who was Snoke?  I don't know man this movie failed on every level except graphics.  The movie was beautiful.  Beautifully awful.","true":true}
