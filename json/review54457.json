Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love Disney and Star Wars but something feels off about this movie. It was good but for old Star Wars fans it left a feeling of disappointment and trust me I am not critical of Star Wars movies all episodes including the force awakens. I think I know what Rian is saying and doing with this movie but the purpose feels rude and a let down. There seems to be a lot of symbolism in the movie regarding old and new and it feels apparent they want to drop the old and it\u2019s all over this movie. It\u2019s very apparent that they don\u2019t like the rumors\\, guessing\\, speculation etc because for the past two years they\u2019ve thrown curve balls and created red herrings. It feels like they are trying to break the old fan base to create a new fan base and as Luke says he\u2019s not the Last Jedi\\, the war is just beginning. I don\u2019t know maybe the next movie will have some real meat(info). I walked out confused and disappointed. Other imax hardcore Star Wars fan\/audience walked out of the first show also seemed disappointed. Can I get a fan made movie on YouTube? In someways those are actually better. ","true":true}
