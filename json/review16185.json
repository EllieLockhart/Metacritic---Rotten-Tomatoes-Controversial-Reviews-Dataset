Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm gonna do this very short\\, the movie is a mess\\, it has a lot of subplots that serves no point and distract from the main story (which is not very interesting) and the two climaxes are bad\\, really really bad\\, plus\\, all villains setted in VII do nothing and are discarded like garbage on the story.","true":true}
