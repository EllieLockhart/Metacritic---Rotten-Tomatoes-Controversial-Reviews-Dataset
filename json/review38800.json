Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"they destroyed the symbol of Luke Skywalker. yeah to the new generation of watchers eff to the dedicated and faithful. How critics like this movie is a guarantee they are not faithful to the stories. It could have been so good and the writer killed it. Don't watch it if you hold a vision of how you saw the series. It's all about money and franchising. Total joke!!!","true":true}
