Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bad writing all the way through and poor continuity with established Star Wars lore. Offending the fan base that flocks to midnight premi\u00e8res and goes to see the films 3 times in the first week is not a good business model for this franchise.","true":true}
