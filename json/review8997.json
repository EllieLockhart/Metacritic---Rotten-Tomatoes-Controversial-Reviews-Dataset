Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From the very beginning\\, when a terrible actor playing a terrible character is sent in one X-wing to fight a star destroyer fleet\\, I started to worry. Then the screen writer (who obviously doesn't understand humour) decides to try and turn it into a comedy with that \\\"I can't hear you\\\" garbage I thought \\\"Oh no... What have they done\\\".... Then one of the biggest dreadnoughts in the galaxy is taken down by one bomber dropping bombs IN ZERO GRAVITY..... and it just goes nowhere but downhill from there. Leia turns into a dead flying witch\\, Finn fails in his search for a code breaker but luckily finds one in his prison cell (so badly written). BB8 driving an AT-ST (WTF)\\, General Hux\\, and that STUPID ending with Luke projecting and then dying without explanation... This movie SUCKS","true":true}
