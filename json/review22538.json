Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let's fight against Disney's Evil Empire\\, rebels!\\nDon't let the dark side prevail.\\nLet's bring the audience score of this abomination of a movie down to 30% or less.\\nMay the Force be with us.","true":true}
