Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is so terribly written it not only has no appreciation for the series foundations it takes a hammer to the questions TFA set up. \\n  Although the film does begin to pick up in the second half\\, it is plagued by disjointed sub plots that are clumsily tacked together and don't really add anything to the overall film and many of the climactic scenes just fall very short of the mark.\\n  Pathos: omg. It is impossible to forn any love or emotional attachment to this film as it cannot go five mins without some gag or merch plug.\\n\\n  And\\, yes there is an obvious socio-political message planted in here (although it monumentally backfired)\\n\\n  Conclusion: disney has no love for you\\, your heroes or the series from the series from creative standpoint; only what it can milk from it. It is impossible to see where the series can go from here","true":true}
