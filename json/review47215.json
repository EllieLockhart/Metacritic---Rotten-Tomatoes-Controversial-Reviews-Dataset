Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What an unbelievable disappointment.  I don't know where to start.  From throwing away the story elements and characters introduced in The Force Awakens to badly reinventing the manner and extent to which Force effects could be manifested in the galaxy.  Why bother making a multi-film story arc if you're going to make uninspired detours that abandon foreshadowing and kill off potential foils for the hero(es).  We\\, the audience\\, bought into the storyline introduced by The Force Awakens\\, and this movie threw it ALL in the trash can!  I find it utterly ironic that the \\\"Critics Consensus\\\" on Rotten Tomatoes says that this movie \\\"honors the saga's rich legacy\\\" when in reality it is fundamentally disrespectful to the franchise.","true":true}
