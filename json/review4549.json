Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cinematography was good\\, action was fun\\, plot had holes but the absolute trashing of one of the most iconic heroes of our cinema time to prematurely thrust the new characters to the forefront is unconscionable.  I can see why Mark Hamill did not like the direction for Luke. He ended up a getting a pixie filled Mickey Mouse boot in the rear. I am not averse to change and new\\, but this was poorly handled. A real slap in George Lucas's face.","true":true}
