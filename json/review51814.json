Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A fan of star wars my whole life.. until now. Worst movie ever made. Don't see it. I created an account on here just for this movie. So disappointed. I gave it one star so that it would count towards the total average but would have otherwise given it a 0.","true":true}
