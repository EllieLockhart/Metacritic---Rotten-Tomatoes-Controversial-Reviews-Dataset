Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoted this installment of the starwars franchise. There were a few moments that i felt were  a bit akward but in total the movie was captivating. My 8 year old loved it. Cant wait for episode 9!","true":true}
