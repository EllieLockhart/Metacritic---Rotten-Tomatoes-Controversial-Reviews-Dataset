Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All the critics must be paid by Disney.  And the positive reviews must be from bots\\nThis movie was terrible.  It had cool visuals but that's all.  The worst part was Luke's character\\, he was not a hero or evil\\, either of those would have been better.  He was nothing\\, the legend of Luke Skywalker was apocryphal\\, he created Kylo then refused to help fix the problems he created.  The man that saw good in Vader would think of killing a teenager\\, impossible. Even at the end he did nothing.  They dishonored the hero we grew up loving.  \\nBeyond ruining Luke\\, many gaping plot holes.  \\nFin's role was pointless and caused hundreds of rebels to die.  \\nSnoke and Phasma were weak and went down like Jawas.  \\nKylo's turn to the dark side was based on a misunderstanding.  \\nFlying Leia was moronic.  \\nWhy not tell Poe the plan and save hundreds of lives?  \\nWhy didn't a star destroyer cut off the rebels ship?  \\nNo lightsaber duels!!!!!  \\nBB-8 can't be the solution to every problem(In the AT-ST\\, get's the ship\\, stops the prison guards...).  \\nWhy didn't the laws of physics apply to Rose's ship.  Fin is heading straight at full speed\\, she turns and comes at him from the side\\, and dooms everyone and stops him for actually helping the rebellion.  \\nIf Yoda can affect the physical world with lightning\\, why isn't he helping the rebels?\\nRey going down the dark side pit\\, we learned nothing\\, it was pointless.\\nThat's all I can remember at the moment.\\nRey moving those rocks was cool(even though we never see her move anything prior to that\\, not sure when she developed that ability)\\n\\nOnly casual Star Wars fans and children could like this movie.  If you are a serious Star Wars fan\\, you will hate it.","true":true}
