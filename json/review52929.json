Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A poorly thought out sequel with clear contradictions to TFA\\, bad character moments (and characters)\\, plot contrivances\\, and poorly timed humor shouldn't be enough to dissuade your average movie goer looking for some flashy effects\\, action\\, and a few laughs\\, but as an old fan that held the series on a higher standard than Bay's Transformers flicks or Snyder's DC films this was an enourmous - and at times insulting - dissapointment.\\n\\nJust be prepared to \\\"turn off your brain\\\" as they say if you want to try enjoying this simplistic flick.","true":true}
