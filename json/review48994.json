Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars film to date. I saw Force Awakens 4 times because I overall felt it was a good movie (It wasn't what I wanted as a fan\\, but I understood it was a movie to set up future movies). Last Jedi is full of plot holes\\, bad character development\\, and had too many jokes. I will not see this movie again and I will not see the next one. Watch Angryjoes \\\"10 things he hates about Last Jedi.\\\" I agree with just about all of it.","true":true}
