Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As kilo ren says in this movie \\\"let the past die\\, kill it if you have to.\\\" To me and many people Rian Johnson has taken this quote to heart and has ruined the Star Wars universe with is feminist funded anti men film by not keeping to the lore of the universe and by creating so many plot holes that even spongebob has less holes in him than this movie. Despite what he has done to the lore\\, the movie is kinda enjoyable (mindless joy) especially some of the fight scenes and looks spectacular at some points. However this does not excuse Rian Johnson one bit for not having his writers do at least one bit of research before writing this at best Star Wars fanfic. And Rian Johnson love for ww2 bombers ruins the established lore that y wing BOMBERS ARE BETTER AND FASTER THAN SOME SLOW TANKY SHIPS WHICH EXPLODE IN ONE HIT! If you are a true Star Wars fan who loves the lore and knows more about Star Wars than Rian Johnson and his feminist loving writers. Then you will hate this movie like I did.","true":true}
