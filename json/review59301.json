The game is a dream to play when you're looting\\, running around\\, or taking in the scenery.\r\rNaughty Dog does stumble in places\\, however. The combat and stealth feel dated and rusty compared to the polished finesse in other departments\\, and the narrative suffers from inconsistent pacing. A few character decisions are out of place and there are more than several moments that are eye-rollingly heavy handed.\r\rOverall\\, TLOU2 isn't the masterpiece that I think many critics have portrayed it as. It's an ambitious title that pushes the capabilities of the medium\\, but as an experience it's overly long\\, self-important\\, and doesn't say as much as it thinks it does. It is still a great time\\, and if you were a fan of the shoot-em and loot-em mechanics from the first game you'll feel at home here. By no means groundbreaking\\, but still absolutely worth trying - regardless of what angry fanboys said at release.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
