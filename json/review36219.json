Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was the most disappointing Star Wars Movie to date. Disney\\, Ms. Kennedy\\,  and Mr. Johnson are destroying a billion dollar franchise. The movie was just SJW and Feminist Propaganda. Luke who should be  the EU version was just some pathetic weak old man. That isn't the Luke Skywalker I know and love. I will not being seeing the 9th movie. Side note you should make a movie for your target audience not people who will never see your movie.  PS. Snoke should have been Plageuis.","true":true}
