Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The short of the critique\\, this film is technically solid and polished.  Photography is great\\, the music is better than TFA\\, good effects (SFX and physical)\\, and design.\\n\\nHowever it generally fails to be a sequel to any previous film.  It's story falls flat in the 2nd act and ultimately is unsatisfying.  It's 3rd act flips on it's own message and tries to be a Star Wars film but still is disappointing.\\n\\nI cannot recommend this film on the basis that it resets TFA and generally does not honor the character of Luke Skywalker in a believable way.  Rey is presented with an intriguing offer that in a film filled with \\\"subversion\\\" she fails to subvert.  There's no redemption for this film short of technical achievements.","true":true}
