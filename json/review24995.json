Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My opinion  is the movie was a departure from anything done in Star Wars. You will love it\\, hate it\\, or think it was just okay. I am still excited to see where they will go from here. You should watch it and make your own opinion.","true":true}
