Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible. So disappointed.  Too many reasons why! I'll bullet point to avoid being too verbose. \\n*Entire storyline that is confusing and futile\\n*Stupid \\\"love story\\\" that has no backing or chemistry\\n*3+ plot lines started in Episode 7: A New Hope that are simply abandoned or concluded abruptly\/lazily \\n*Everything that was done with Luke's character\\n*Don't even get me started on Princess Leia...aka Mary Poppins\\n\\nI don't know where the critics rating is coming from? Seems suspicious to me.  \\n\\nI just hope JJ Abrams can fix this train wreck.","true":true}
