Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The most unpredictable star wars movie.  One surprise after another. \\nI would venture to say one of the most Epic space battles in the franchise's history. It might have a few flaws\\, but as a star wars fan who has been hooked since being taken to the drive in to see episode 4 when i was a small child\\, I could not be more hopeful for the future of this franchise than I was after walking out of the cinema when the credits rolled for Last Jedi.","true":true}
