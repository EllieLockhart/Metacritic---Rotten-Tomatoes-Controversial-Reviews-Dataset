Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It doesn't go the way you think... which is ok\\, but there are more negatives than positives in the end.  There is no sense of urgency with the characterisations\\, the story is cumbersome and the humour... It's hit and a lot of miss.  Cringeworthy in parts (Mary Poppins\\n Leia) and lazy in others (Canto)\\, blatant rip offs in others (BAG inspired chase) it tries to make up with some stunning visuals and action scenes but it doesn't feel star wars.  I expected so much more from Rian.","true":true}
