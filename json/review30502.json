Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Shocking ... ive no intrest fot the next movie \\,what they done to luke ill never understand\\, you wait 30 odd years to see luke Skywalker in a new starwars film and this is what we get ????? And rey merry sues her way through the film no training or anything ..just felt like the director was giving me the finger the whole time","true":true}
