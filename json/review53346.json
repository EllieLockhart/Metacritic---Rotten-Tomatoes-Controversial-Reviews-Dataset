Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Depressingly hollow. Heartbreakingly dissapointing.\\n\u00a0I wrote a rant a mile long\\, and deleted it in a fit of rage. It made good points\\, and I thought it was well written. This next bit is my new review.\\n\\nThis movie is so shockingly bad\\, it deserves less effort then I'm putting in to reviewing it. The majority of this movie's plot is worthless\\, and with that shambles weighing it down\\, every good part of this movie is corrupted.\\n\\nI fell in love with Star Wars a long time ago\\, and this movie broke my heart and fractured my soul. The only reason I still care is that I want it to get better\\, but it kills me a little on the inside to know that someone ever thought this cancerous tumor was worthy of the name Star Wars: The Last Jedi. \\n\\nUnless JJ Abrams finds a way redeem this trilogy\\, I will have permanently lost a treasure I held close to my heart for the majority of my life. This thought literally brings me to tears\\, but it is as true as anything I will ever say.\\n\\nRian Johnson and those responsible for this calamity should live for eternity\\, so they can spend it all being tortured by the knowledge of how bad of a movie they made\\, and when the guilt finally crushes them permanently beneath its monumental weight they will only then be allowed to take their own lives\\, and since neither God in Heaven nor Satan in Hell have room for such horrific souls\\, they will be reborn with no memories to live through this despicable failure from the outside\\, and only when they see the truth of their devastating mistakes without knowing that they were responsible\\, will the truth be revealed and they will take their lives once again as they realize they caused themselves pain they can never escape.\\n\\nAnd then they will wake from the previously detailed nightmare.\\nAnd with a pervasive feeling of guilt\\, give thanks for all the good fortune they have ever had\\, and dedicate themselves to correcting their grevious error.\\n\\nOR\\n\\nAnd if they deny their failures\\, they will be haunted for eternity by this catastrophe\\, and will be remembered and hated a thousand times more for their failure than their successes. People will quietly celebrate when they inevitably die\\, and I am ashamed to say that I too will celebrate.\\n\\nIf you cannot tell\\, I am very passionate about things that I loved. This may have been too raw of me\\, and I wish I did not feel this way. But I do. And I will spend the rest of my life seeking justice for the travesty that is Star Wars: The Last Jedi.\\n\\nI apologize to anyone seeking help\\, joy\\, wisdom\\, mentorship\\, or companionship in this review. I am not strong enough to provide them after the devastating blow to my hopes\\, dreams\\, and memories this movie has struck.\\n\\nTL;DR This movie is so bad I cried and started hurting myself. I would pay to have all memory of this movie burned out of my mind.","true":true}
