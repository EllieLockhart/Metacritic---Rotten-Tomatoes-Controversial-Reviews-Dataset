Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a lover of the Star Wars universe and this movie is one of the worst star wars movie since phantom menace. I don't know what they were thinking. They butchered Luke Skywalker\\, Rose and Poe's character with bad writing I was cringing the entire movie. THIS MOVIE IS BAD. Pacing is so off and zero character development just ruined the experience for me. I will not be seeing this movie again. Never again.","true":true}
