Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was an epic and imaginative new look at the world of Star Wars. I can\u2019t believe all the negative fan boy rhetoric. Enjoy the fact we can see a new and different take on the Star Wars universe. It can\u2019t always be 1977. Enjoy the epic battles and new characters that will take this franchise into the future.
