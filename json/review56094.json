Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So mixed. Loved a more in-depth Kylo who is less a whiny temper-tantrum laden character a la Anakin in prequels but now offers a bit more wisdom and realpolitik than I would\u2019ve expected. Some good sequences for sure. But hats where it ends. I\u2019ve become increasingly critical of TFA over pst few years for its lack of originality but that somehow now looks like a strength. With Last Jedi\\, I find after initial viewing a much harsher view of the direction of this film\\, it\u2019s story\\, it\u2019s plot\\, and where this possibly leaves series. I think Disney trusted Johnson too much here and the risk was not worth it. He has by and large failed - at least the loyal original fan base. How Luke and Leia were both handled is just gross negligence. How Rey\u2019s lineage is explained is just silly juxtaposed against her extraordinary Jedi skills sans training. Plot holes and bad decisions and just bad story writing vis-a-vis the heritage of this story is inexcusable and I seriously doubt Abrams is the man to turn it around. Oh well - go have fun and enjoy what you can out of it bc it ain\u2019t all bad. ","true":true}
