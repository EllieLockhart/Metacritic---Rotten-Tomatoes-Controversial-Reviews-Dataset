Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There's a reason why Mark Hamill hates his own character. He isn't playing Luke. I saw it with an open mind and absolutely hated it. These new directors and writers fail to see what these characters are and how to do them justice. Not to mention the terrible pacing acting and cgi that would have made this movie crap without ruining characters. Rian Johnson has been trying to explain why his movie is good. Simply put\\, a good movie and a good director don't have to do that. ","true":true}
