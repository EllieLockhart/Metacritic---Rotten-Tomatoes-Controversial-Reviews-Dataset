Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"About as bad as it gets for Star Wars. I rewatched the newer prequels from the 2000s and I couldn't help but find a extreme gulf between this atrocity and the genius plot from before. I couldn't name half the characters minutes after leaving the theater and couldn't for the life of me remember what the whole plot even attempted to achieve. What a travesty of a movie and worse still that they dragged the Star Wars name with it.","true":true}
