Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Now initially when I first watched it I didn\u2019t really know what to think \\, and therefore I went along with the negative backlash. However after watching it again with some friends I realised that it\u2019s actually quite a well thought out clever film \\, with over arching themes and character arcs \\, regardless if you agree with them or not . I understand the criticism but I think people are taking this too far . For example this film isn\u2019t really pushing a political agenda . Anything that may suggest that Is more due in part to episode 7 . I think the most prominent criticism is directed at this film when it should be to 7 instead \\, not to say that this film is free of criticism. In fact there is lot to complain about especially if you are a Star Wars fan and you grew up with the original trilogy. However I don\u2019t view these things to take away from the overall quality of the film so therefore I\u2019m giving credit where credit is due . This film actually put some thought into it suppose to the force awakens which was more big flashy explosions. Regardless if you agree with the decisions in the film or not they did try \\, which is better than nothing .","true":true}
