Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a heavy handed flogging the Star Wars Franchise that seeming told \\\"fan boys\\\" that \\\"this isn't the Star Wars you remember. Let the past go\\\".\\n\\nMore that than\\, it was shoehorned into the Marvel MCU formula. It's a two and a half hour advertisement for the next movie.\\n\\nThe one shining thing from this movie is\\, Adam Driver made Kylo Ren interesting. \\n\\nI guess that's a win at least.","true":true}
