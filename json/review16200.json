Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm honestly shocked at all of the negative reviews this movie is receiving. It has beautiful cinematography\\, incredible\\, soulful acting\\, and has a pristine\\, moving focus on character development. I really appreciated the boldness of this movie in taking Star Wars into a new realm. I loved this movie and will certainly go watch it many more times.","true":true}
