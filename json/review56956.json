Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst film I have seen in a long time. Completely craps on the entire franchise and undo's everything that was built up previously. After the first 20 minutes i already knew that disney had gotten their disguisting money greed grapled around the most sacred franchise known. So many WTF moments\\, so many shit jokes\\, absolutely lazy mess of a film completely aimed to sell toys to 5 year olds. Star wars is yes a little corny with dialogue but Last Jedi honestly made me feel sick. Honestly didnt even feel like star wars\\, more like a GI joe or superman- obviously Leia can fill that role flying in space?!? Dont know how they could get it so wrong after the masterpieces of Rogue One and Force Awakens\\, SOS someone save Star Wars.","true":true}
