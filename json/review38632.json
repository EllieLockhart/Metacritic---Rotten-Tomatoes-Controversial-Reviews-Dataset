Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars movie to date. It makes the prequels look good. The gaps in logic and basic reasoning in this movie are profound. How are Rose and Finn still alive\\, i.e. why didn't the walkers shoot them? Why would they fall in love after only 12 hours of knowing each? Why would Luke leave a map behind if he didn't want to be found? How could Snoke be so powerful and seemingly omniscient and could read people's minds and yet couldn't sense that Kylo Ren would kill him? Why would Luke want to kill Ben when he worked so hard in the OT to redeem the second most evil man in the galaxy without killing him? Why does the Force let you fly like Mary Poppins\\, and why haven't the Jedi done it before? Why didn't Holdo just tell her plans to Poe? There are so many more plot holes than this that completely undermine the suspension of disbelief for me. You can't have any lasting feelings about a story if all events that happen are meaningless and impossible and contradictory of all basic reason and logic. All that remains is confusion and disappointment.","true":true}
