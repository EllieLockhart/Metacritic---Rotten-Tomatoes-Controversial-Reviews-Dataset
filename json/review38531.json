Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst star wars movie by far. I mean\\, even \\\"The Phantom Menace\\\" looks like an absolute masterpiece compared to this mess. I think the main points why it is so bad have been discussed a lot already. Disney just has no innovation\\, and the spirit of Star Wars died when Lucas sold it to the white slavers aka Disney.","true":true}
