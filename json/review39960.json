Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is garbage! I am a huge Star Wars fan. I watched everyone since they came out. I felt totally let down by this movie. Even the prequels with Jar Jar are better than this movie. What happened to the magic? Episode 7 was good\\, This episode had no character development and was all over the place. I will not be buying this movie. I feel depressed and feeling ripped off.","true":true}
