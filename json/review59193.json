Now\\, it got review bombed first because a bunch of bigots got their buttholes puckered over dumb stuff AND THEN because people apparently wanted everything the exact same as last time? And they felt misled by the trailer (which is good thing imo\\, trailers give away WAY too much). I guess I can't understand not wanting to know what happens. If you haven't played it\\, but think you know it's gonna be awful\\, I think maybe you should just play it and have an informed opinion. Is it heart breaking? Yes. But it's also...realistic and compelling. I walked away with an *intensely* different outlook and perspective on both the first and this game and the people in them. Basically if you like stories you should give this one a chance. It was moving in every emotion in the book. If you don't you're missing out and that's all I got to say on it \u2026 Expand","true":true}
