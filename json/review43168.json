Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This ruined the series. The plot holes were everywhere\\, the story jumped all over the place\\, the character development of new characters was horrendous! Its like the director never heard of Star Wars before getting into this movie. The writers and producers should be ashamed. So much poor judgement on the storyline that does not fit in with any previous star wars movies. I get they want to make a mark on the series\\, but destroy everything that was ever built? \\n\\nIf this movie would have been a stand alone movie it would've recieved 3 stars. The acting\\, effects\\, etc were decent. But this is a franchise\\, a legend\\, a continuation of 50 years of excellence and this movie ruined it all. Im appalled at the ok reviews. Who is paying for the semi-decent reviews? Have they ever seen a star wars movie in their life? Im not even a big star wars fan! Ive seen every movie maybe once or twice. Probably never seeing another one again.","true":true}
