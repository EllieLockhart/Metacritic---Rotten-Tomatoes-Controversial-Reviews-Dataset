Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I did enjoy some of the key images and the cinematography generally. Perhaps if I watch it again it will be with the sound down and music playing.\\nBut as for the rest\\, it deserves every criticism levelled at it. And I like others call BS on the critics 90% rating.\\nSo yeah they did a pretty shitty job of it\\, when they had a some great elements to do so well.","true":true}
