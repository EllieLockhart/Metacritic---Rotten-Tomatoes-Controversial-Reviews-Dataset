Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After watching it a second time\\, I think the film is even more disappointing than the first time I watched it. \\n\\nYes\\, there are moments that were entertaining\\, yes the acting was good (very good in some cases\\,) but above all: I think this movie is a big missed opportunity. \\n\\nMy thoughts right now are a bit disjointed\\, I'm just home from the theatre. But my overall sentiment is: what a waste.","true":true}
