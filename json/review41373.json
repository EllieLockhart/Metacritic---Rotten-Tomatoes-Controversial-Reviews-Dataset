Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a mixed bag for me....some things I really despised (Porgs\\, BB8\\, the space leprachaun & some bad humor \\\"Chrome Dome\\\") but I enjoyed how unpredictable it was. Leia was great...yes even that scene that people are complaining about....to me that was the best scene...I am glad it got rid of alot of lingering things from the previous movies....it is a very different Star Wars movie.....but still a disappointment for what it could have been","true":true}
