Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible. Really so badly written our whole Star Wars fanatic family were disappointed in the extreme. Cardboard characters\\, idiotic spaghetti plot turns that are miraculously solved with all the good guys intact by some stroke of luck.. .  And for goodness sake\\, why can't the bloody empire fire more than one freaking blaster at a time!!! Terrible.","true":true}
