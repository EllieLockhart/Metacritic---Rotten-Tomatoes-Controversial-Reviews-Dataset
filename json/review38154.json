Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The theme of this film is now failure can be the best teacher. Failure of the master to the student\\, failure of the subordinate to the rank\\, failure of the mission. The Luke complaints forget he was impulsive\\, arrogant\\, and naive in the OT\\, he should not have been teaching others\\, let alone doing much as I guarantee you he would have had severe ptsd after nearly killing his father and truly killing millions of individuals. I will agree the casino scene and the Leia poppins could have done better\\, but the rest is so good I overlook those. Also... gravity in space is only a legit concern in hard sci fi\\, not science fantasy space opera.","true":true}
