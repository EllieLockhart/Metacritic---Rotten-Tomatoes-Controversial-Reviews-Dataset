Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lifelong fan of the Star Wars franchise\\, I thoroughly enjoyed this latest offering. Such a treat to see so much of Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill along with a slew of great new characters.","true":true}
