Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Total and deep deception. Both the film and the trilogy is a huge HUGE waste of time and money\\, without any goal than making money. \\nPeople shit on Lucas with the prelogy\\, but at least granps George had something to say with his baby\\, and took some risks while trying to do something new. \\n\\nNot here. It's empty\\, it's a f*cking mess\\, it's poorly written and they even success to miss Carrie Fisher's exit of the saga. Shame on you Johnson\\, Shame on you Abrams\\, Shame on you Disney. \\n\\nAt least there is ONE visually amazing scene in here to save the day\\, otherwise the rest is trash.","true":true}
