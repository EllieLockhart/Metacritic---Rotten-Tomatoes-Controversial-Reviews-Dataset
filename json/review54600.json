Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm really not sure where to begin with this one.\\n\\nIn terms of a film - it was fine. Just fine. Definitely worse than The Force Awakens.\\n\\nThe story lines feel pretty flat. The messages that many have labelled with the term SJW (and I understand why)\\, I felt were too on the nose. I don't disagree with the inclusion of these in films but if they're going to be done in such a  ham fisted way - Just don't bother.\\n\\nToo much humour\\, and too silly when it was done. Prank phone calls to \\\"General Hugs\\\" aren't the same as Han in the dentention block. (We're all fine here\\, now\\, thank you. How are you?)\\n\\nLuke's characterisation felt off. The way he casually tosses the light saber over his shoulder was just ridiculous\\, the leaf scene with Rey. I did enjoy the scene showing how he lived on the island. Disappointed he didn't make Rey give him a piggy back ride around the island.\\n\\nCaptain Phasma is painfully and obviously shoe horned in at the last minute only to disappear much the same way she did in the first film.\\n\\nSnoke's story abruptly cut short\\, and no mention of the Knights of Ren. Kylo Ren had some good bits in this film - I might say his arc was probably the best\\, along with Poe's (the execution of Poe's less so)\\n\\nI left the theatre feeling a little bit empty and disappointed over all.\\n\\nPositive points: Kylo is THICC AF. Damn son.","true":true}
