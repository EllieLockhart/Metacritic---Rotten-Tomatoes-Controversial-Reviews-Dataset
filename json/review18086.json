Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Fans went into this movie want very specific things - Rey had to be a Skywalker\/Kenobi\/Palpatine\\, Kylo will return to the light\\, Snoke is Mace Windu - and when none of that happened\\, they hated it. But I guarantee if it did happen\\, people would have been upset because it was to predictable. I liked it because they took risks. Luke tossing away the lightsaber? Unexpected. Leia using the Force to save herself? Unexpected. Reys parentage being nobody's? Unexpected. Snoke not being a returning character? Fine and unexpected. The casino scenes were valuable because we've seen a lot.of run down\\, slums\\, crummy  \\n looking selfish people. This time we see the rich\\, snobby\\, stuck up selfish people. It was a nice twist on a classic plot point. They took risks with this movie which is what fans wanted and they still aren't happy. Thank you Rian\\, Daisy\\, Mark\\, John\\, Henry\\, everyone else\\, and especially Carrie for making a phenomenal movie!","true":true}
