Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie to date\\, including the prequels which seem like The Godfather trilogy in comparison. The old characters delivered in a lot of good ways but the movie was dragged down by a poor plot\\, bad execution\\, and new characters that make me never want to watch another Star Wars movie as long as I live. Rose is just the worse. ","true":true}
