Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie managed to be an amazing homage to ESB and ROTJ while also going in a completely new and interesting direction.  The story was completely character-driven\\, and took each one to new heights.  It was a fantastic exploration of identity and choice for each person.","true":true}
