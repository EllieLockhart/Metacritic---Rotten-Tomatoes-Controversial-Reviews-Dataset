Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"complete trash of a movie. Critics need to get their eyes and head checked. I feel like star wars has never left the 80's and never evolved. Easily one of the worst movies to come out this year with Dunkirk. critics are just a bunch of fan boys.","true":true}
