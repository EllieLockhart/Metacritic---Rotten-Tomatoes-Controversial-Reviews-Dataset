Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Makes the prequals look good.  Most of the event in this movie dont even progress the story\\, they just waste screen time.  Many of the characters were poorly written as well as much of the \\\"chemistry\\\" between them.  Just terrible.  Wait until its on Netflix for free.","true":true}
