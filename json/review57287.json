Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a mess. Poor writing and poor directing. They weren't true to the characters.  It's like Luke Skywalker and Leah were completely different people than from the other movies.  Did the writers not watch the originals? The plot was choppy and nonsensical.  A 45 minute tangent plot to hire a codebreaker that went nowhere.  A lot of scenes that made no sense at all.  I'm still scratching my head wondering how in the world this movie got good reviews.  The music and acting were good\\, which is why I gave it any stars at all.","true":true}
