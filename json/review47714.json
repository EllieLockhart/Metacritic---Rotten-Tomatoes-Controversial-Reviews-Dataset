Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When I saw it opening night I left feeling good\\, I was happy that it wasn't another rehash of original material like I felt TFA was. Then I saw it again. The lack of continuity with TFA is jarring once you notice it\\, and without any spoilers I will just say that the characters are essentially still undeveloped. I find myself not even excited to see how it ends.","true":true}
