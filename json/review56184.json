Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The biggest twist of all is the ~40% of the fanbase embarrassing the rest of us with some genuinely mind-bending complaints. People come into this franchise with so many expectations and a strict \\\"headcanon\\\" that they become rabid when those expectations get subverted.\\n\\nThe writing\\, acting\\, and cinematography are all award-worthy. There's a reason why the film has done so well critically (even better among 'top critics' on this site). Star Wars does not have to be the same thing it was when you were 8 years old\\, and it's so refreshing to see someone take risks in this universe. It's up there with ESB for me\\, if not even better.","true":true}
