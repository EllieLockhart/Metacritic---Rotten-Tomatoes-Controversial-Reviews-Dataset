But the pacing and the story falls short if its potential and it treats the fans like they are idiots. There is a boring and stupid back and forth between characters and the 2 story lines that never reaches a solid conclusion in the end.

The music is beautiful the sound design is dynamic.\rMy honest score is 8 out of 10 but the story treated me (a real fan of the first game) like an idiot and I don't like it. That's why I'm giving it a 0 out of 10.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
