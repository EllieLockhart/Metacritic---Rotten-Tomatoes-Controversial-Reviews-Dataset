Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While still mediocre\\, this is a worthy addition to Star Wars. Many (if not all) characters remain interesting\/intimidating\\, the visuals are once again top notch\\, and the music is once again a John Williams classic. Snoke is horribly written but well acted\\, and Rey's training under Luke is the best part of the film. Rose\\, while overall a waste of time\\, is a much better character than many give her credit for\\, and Phasma had potential to be a true villain. Meanwhile Hux is rendered idiotic and weak\\, which is sad\\, as I was looking forward to more of his powerfully worded evil speeches.","true":true}
