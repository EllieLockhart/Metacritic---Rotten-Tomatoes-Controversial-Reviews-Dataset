Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All you people rating this movie so low are the most basic of fans trapped in the box of their childhood. \\n\\nThis trend of \\\"rating\\\" movies is comical because each one of you people entered the theater wanting nothing more than another death star and awful lightsaber choreography. \\n\\nI can only urge those of you to get out of your box of preconceived notions and actually open your eyes. This film is the best of the series followed by episode lll. Both have a complex morality founded on the principle of balance and the challenges faced when confronted with the image you see in the mirror. There is so much nostalgia throughout this film and that is capitalized with John Williams best score to date. With superb acting from characters of old and new\\, The Last Jedi takes star wars to a level of completeness the series has always been lacking. Add in amazing visuals coupled with the struggle of an outnumbered rebellion you get a five star movie worth rewatching over and over again.","true":true}
