Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just.... bad. It had great moments but they were so few and far between and felt lifted from another far superior movie. Unanswered questions\\, a multitude of new ones\\, unfinished plot threads and poor dialogue attempting he Marvel\/Bendis quip formula and failing\\, leaving the most watered down Star Wars yet. All with some hyper violence moments that feel at odds with the ostensibly children's movie they've made\\, as if  all the adults in the room are there for action set pieces. \\n\\nAnd let's just not mention how bad the Mary Poppins moment is. The rest of the movie may as well have happened in a dream after that - and I expect they may try to pull this later.","true":true}
