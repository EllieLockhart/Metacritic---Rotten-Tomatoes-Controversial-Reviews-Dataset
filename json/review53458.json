Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney Wars Episode 8 The Phantom Jedi was something I had waited most of my life to see. I grew up on the original trilogy\\, and knew in an age with great special affects and CGI that we might finally see Luke Skywalker as a Master and what he could accomplish using the force. Alas all we got was Luke\\, milking an alien. No grand saber fight\\, no amazing use of the force (other than astral projection) and a death scene for absolutely no reason. Luke is a washed up has been who failed to kill his own kin. The only nostalgic moment was with a force ghost Yoda\\, which was one of the only reasons to see this movie. With such an amazing cast of actors\\, a previous installment that was wonderful\\, this production team managed to deflate the entire Star Wars universe with such lazy imagination as; Rey's parents sold her for beer money\\, light speed GPS tracking system\\, nonsense side quests straight out of a video game. Answers for questions debated over endlessly since Episode 7 were made completely irrelevant. It doesn't matter who Snoke is or was. The only momentary gems which are far and few between\\, are the only thing that makes this made to sell toys movie watchable. Leaving us true fans with nothing to look forward to from the next installment. It is sad that as we say good bye to our princess\\, she had to have this be her last movie. From writers and a director that have probably never seen a Star Wars movie\\, the entire team should never again be allowed to work on this franchise. Help us J.J Abrams\\, you're our only hope.","true":true}
