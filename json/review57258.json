Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had everything going for it\\, great characters setup from the previous film\\, and the fact that we were going to see Luke Skywalker in action for the first time since Return of the Jedi.  Unfortunately it does not deliver on any of these elements\\, no pay-off\\, messy storytelling\\, and plot holes that in effect break the Star Wars universe.  But if you don't think about anything or care about any of the characters\\, it is a fairly well paced romp (apart from Canto Bight) so it is watchable and visually well made\\, but in the end it is highly frustrating and nonsensical.","true":true}
