Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Definitely a movie for the Star Wars fans! A little long but well worth it. This film captured the struggles between the dark side and answer most if not all the questions from the Force Awakens.","true":true}
