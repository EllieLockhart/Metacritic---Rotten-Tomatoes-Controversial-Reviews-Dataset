{"101487":134350,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just signed up for an account on this app to leave a rating specifically for this let down. My Background - I grew up everything Star Wars; from the movies\\, to the video games like Shadows of the Empire\\, and Rogue Squadron on N64\\, to the comics\\, to the tv series Clone Wars and Rebels\\, and so much more. This film is the biggest let down Star Wars has ever given me. Review - this movie is a mess. The story is so lackluster it leaves you wondering who approved the script. The new characters introduced are written in so poorly. They are given no backstory\\, and are so easily disposable. Yet you\u2019re expected as a viewer to have emotions for them. When you don\u2019t\\, it\u2019s so noticeable and instead of following the story\\, I was left wondering why I don\u2019t care about these characters. Every single thing you\u2019d want the second movie to pick up from in the first in a sequential sense is tossed out the window. Every single plot opening created by Force Awakens\\, is casually referenced and then discarded. The movie just doesn\u2019t feel like a Star Wars film. As a fan\\, I was left waiting\\, and hoping for that feeling. At times\\, you\u2019re teased with that feeling\\, but then it\u2019s ripped away. Plot and spoilers - the movie starts off Strong and in a familiar way. The rebels are running from an almost certain end. However the film immediately loses that familiar \u201cStar Wars\u201d feeling. For half the movie\\, the first order slow -speed chases a rebel fleet through space\\, as they\u2019re burning through gas. Leia- gets blasted out of the cockpit - and force pushes her way back to the ship; In what is the most visually uncomfortable scene of the movie. There is inner squabbling between the rebels during the slow-speed chase which seems so forced and unnecessary. Meanwhile fin and a new character\\, rose\\, go on a side quest to find a way to escape the first order\u2019s slow speed-chase. Rose plays a huge role in the film\\, however no one decided to give her a worthwhile story that makes you have any emotional attachment to her. Rose and Fin end up on a casino planet\\, which not only looks visually terrible due to the decision to scrap all practical effects\\, and use all cgi - but also the choice to write any tangible storyline. It\u2019s like a \u201cclip-show\u201d. Meanwhile the meat and potatoes of what this film was built to be - Rey and Luke is such a let down. Luke refuses to train Rey and instead we\u2019re left with a gag reel\\, and a bunch of unlikeable alien characters on this far off desolate planet which we\u2019ve waited two years to see more of. If you\u2019re curious\\, the new animals \u201cporgs\u201d- which have bee shoved down our throats for months- are the equivalent of a seagull. Supreme leader snoke has zero value to the story. We finally meet this evil doer ruling the first order\\, and he\u2019s immediately wiped out. We are given no true understanding of why kylo turned to the dark side. An amazing opportunity for storytelling is of the Jedi academy\\, Luke as a master and teacher\\, and Ben solos transformation into ren is brushed over in 2 minutes. Meanwhile other parts of the film drag on unnecessarily. Poe\\, the coolest character next to Han in the force awakens\\, is turned into a sniveling baby with no credibility. A showdown between Luke and kylo is so unbearable. The cgi is incredibly distracting. At one point in the the showdown Luke Skywalker literally \u201cbrushes his shoulder off\u201d in the jay-z sense. Surprisingly\\, \u201cdirt off your shoulders\u201d did not follow. If you\u2019re still reading this\\, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m just so heartbroken. And so baffled by the \u201ccritics\u201d who praise this movie. Not only does it now work as a Star Wars film\\, but as a film in general. I give it two kisses\\, and three wet mouths. -Terry Bruge-Hiplo ","true":true}
