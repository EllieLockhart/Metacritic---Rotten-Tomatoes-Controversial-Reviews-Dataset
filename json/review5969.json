Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing. So many parts that were just to cheesy and then the same story line but rehashing with new characters\\, good jedi turns bad would of been better if this one could of been different if Kylo could of been saved. This one is my least favorite of all.","true":true}
