Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Grew up on the OT\\, liked the prequel trilogy. Star Wars purist. Loved the film.\\n\\nStar Wars is bold again. As it should be. People just aren't happy their fan theories didn't come true and want to preserve their pristine view of certain characters. This film dares to question that\\, and some fans can't get around that. It's hilarious.\\n\\nLoved the film. Go watch it.","true":true}
