Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a long time Star Wars fan but I just can't help myself to try to see past the trash Disney gave us... in a way they created a new franchise that is a shadow of its former self and mocks the long time fans. Bad plot + bad script =bad. And i have to repeat this film is just simply sadistic to all of the old fans. The film had so much potential left for it to use from the force awakings but it is as if they completely forgot the story before it. Another severe problem is you can't help but notice the subliminal left wing political views that makes it seem like they're trying to change yourself while you watch the movie. I strongly feel the starwars franchise will strongly suffer from this film for generations to come.","true":true}
