Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A very nice surprise on this one. An original story\\, this is to Star Wars saga what Musashi was to Samurai Novels. The hero that is naturally talented but ignore all conventions  in her self learning journey.  An adversary that recognizes himself as a conqueror and does what most princes in world history did. Let no one stand in front of their ambitions. A mix of Charles Martell and Alexander the Great. Also\\, Mark Hammil plays a Luke Skywalker in a very different light from his Ben Kenobi teacher. Still to see what's going on with the other characters\\, as  they are still been developed to fulfill their achievements. I didn't expect none of these \\, and I'm glad I do not have to see the original trilogy reenacted\\, but a new story that stands by its own.","true":true}
