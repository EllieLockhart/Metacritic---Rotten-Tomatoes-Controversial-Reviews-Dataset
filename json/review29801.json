Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Right from the beginning you'll see the dialogue isn't crafty or artful\\, they make the general seem like a total incompetent idiot\\, which takes away from the threat the First Order has which weakens the tension throughout the story. The whole notion of the rebel fleet staying out of range of the First order seems a little ridiculous considering the technology they have. Even considering that\\, there wasn't any emotional suspense built up\\, take the movie speed for example when the bus is running out of gas\\, now that is suspense. Also\\, I would of loved to of seen an epic lightsaber battle and I didn't get that. There's a lot that didn't sit well as a Star Wars fan\\, that being said it seems to of been geared toward children and current state of society with various political undertones\\, I don't see the next movie being anything special after this disaster.","true":true}
