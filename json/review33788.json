Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TERRIBLE MOVIE The moment Luke tosses the lightsaber over his shoulder is a metaphor for what walt disney is doing with decades of star wars.? - NO LUCAS NO STARWARS.. This was incredibly dumb from Poe fighting off a huge ship by himself at the beginning.. the floating leia\\, Suicide Hyper ship kills everyone except Finn and Rose... the little kid with force powers and broom.. The only thing good was Luke and Yoda\\, Rey\\, Kylo was ok but really SNOKE sucked the lore sucks everything sucks now  SO SO Disappointed just look at the fan reviews instead of the Pro Reviewers who get paid off by disney.","true":true}
