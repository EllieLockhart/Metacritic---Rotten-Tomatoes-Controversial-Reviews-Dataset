Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For the first time - this is a POOR Star Wars movie. Time will show that even the second trilogy is better than this poor sloppy mess that completely ruins everything the force awakens so brilliantly set up. And has any Star Wars movie ever finished at such a complete dead end? All the characters are ruined or killed off. Everything that held magic has been ripped up - a poor movie - but even worse - a movie that wrecks the 1st movie and removes all excitement at seeing a 3rd.","true":true}
