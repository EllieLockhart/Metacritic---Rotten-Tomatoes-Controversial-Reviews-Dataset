Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I honestly can't believe what my eye's just witnessed... \\nThis is the worst Star Wars film I've EVER seen!!!\\nWhen the film came to a close I was left with so many unanswered questions. I'm sad to say that any true Star Wars fan will hate this film.\\nDisney has 100% taken a most beloved franchise and absolutely killed it!\\nI can now see why Mark Hamill hates The Last Jedi. Luke Skywalker wasn't Luke Skywalker at all!!! \\nThanks for killing one of my all time favorite movie franchises.","true":true}
