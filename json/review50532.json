{"101487":96901,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"1 star from me.  SPOILERS BELOW!\\n\\n*****\\n*****\\n*****\\n\\nThe worst part about this movie is how pointless it was. It was the smallest-scale film in the entire Star Wars franchise\\, and that's including Rogue One. As far as the \\\"A-plot\\\"\\, which is the struggle between the First Order (FO) and the Resistance (TR)\\, basically nothing happens.\\, nothing changes. The movie starts with TR vastly outnumbered and outgunned and on the run from the FO\\, and the movie ends with TR vastly outnumbered and outgunned an on the run from the FO. Literally the entire A-plot was TR slowly flying away from the FO. That's it. In Empire Strikes Back\\, this whole plot took like 20 minutes. Smh.\\n\\nAnd because that's it\\, there was just not enough for our cast of characters to do. In TFA\\, JJ Abrams introduced us to several interesting and compelling characters\\, I think chief among them (other than Kylo and Rey) was Finn. But there's nothing for Finn to *do* in the plot of this movie\\, so they send him off to the casino planet with his new love-interest (who was a terrible actor). Then over the course of the film they constantly cut away from much more interesting plotlines to this one (seriously\\, the pacing of this film is just bizarre)\\, which features such compelling elements as rescuing the poor\\, mistreated racing alien-horses\\, and giving a ring to a child to inspire them to be their own Resistance. Wow. So compelling.\\n\\nBack to what I was saying about actual interesting plotlines. There were some. I LOVED the plotline between Rey and Kylo. They are by far the best part of this movie. The chemistry between Driver and Ridley is unexpected and phenomenal. You're never really quite sure what the tone of their relationship is\\, but that's ok because neither are they. They've just got this weird connection which eventually drives Ridley to leave Luke and go to Kylo to turn him and save the Resistance. Which is great because the \\\"training\\\" scenes with Rey and Luke were a JOKE\\, an INSULT to the franchise. I expected wise Master Skywalker to dive into the Jedi lore like never before\\, and Rey to hone her powers so she could really come into her own. But it never happens. Instead it's just scene after scene of bad jokes - Luke drinking space milk straight from the udder\\, Luke tickling Rey with a feather to make her think it's the force\\, etc. Seriously\\, the tone of this movie was bizarre. The CONSTANT humor made it feel like the worst kind of Marvel movie. The serious scenes never had their time to BREATHE because there were constant childish jokes forced in.\\n\\nAnyway\\, all the interesting character progression with Kylo and Rey is destroyed after the AMAZING fight scene against Snoke's guards\\, which was easily the best scene of the film\\, a film which for some reason seemed ashamed of the fact that there were lightsabers or the force at all. At least the prequels had myriad of fun fight scenes set to the most epic John Williams score. In TLJ we get about 1.5 interesting fight scenes\\, set to a completely average John Williams score which does absolutely nothing new\\, just more of the same (and that's alright because \\\"the same\\\" is good\\, it's just not groundbreaking\\, which was disappointing). Anyway\\, at the end of this scene\\, Kylo stays bad and Rey stays good\\, and they go their separate ways - because seriously\\, any time these two characters are with each other\\, whether it's in TLJ or TFA\\, they have to be split up for some reason (and why Rey didn't kill Kylo when he was UNCONSCIOUS is a stupidly humongous plothole). So despite the character moments\\, like Kylo hesitating and choosing NOT to kill his mom when he had the opportunity\\, and Rey INSTANTLY embracing the dark side multiple freaking times on Luke's planet\\, and the two of them bonding over multiple scenes... they end up EXACTLY where they started.\\n\\nCritics\\, and many fans\\, are praising this movie for being bold\\, for subverting your expectations. That's pretty much bullshit. This movie wasn't bold because it had a vision\\, Rian Johnson has NO vision for this franchise\\, and why Disney has given him an entire trilogy is beyond me. But anyway\\, this is a movie that is different for the sake of being different. Like the scene where Snoke dies like a little bitch. I can easily picture Rian Johnson laughing and saying \\\"bet you didn't see that coming PUNK\\\". But what does it add to the story? Nothing man. If Rian Johnson really had a vision to be different for a good reason\\, he would've done something differently with Rey and Kylo. Have one of them turn or both of them turn\\, and team up together and be their own thing. Instead we got the same scene we've seen a million times in the franchise\\, of the angry villain holding his hand out to the good guy and asking him\/her to join him\\, and the plucky hero saying no. Cmon.\\n\\nFor some other specific points...\\n\\n* I feel like Rey's parentage is definitely a lie\\, unless they've just decided to retcon that whole flashback-vision scene from TFA. Remember that scene? Where we see the people that left Rey on the planet (presumably her parents) fly seemingly off-planet in a pretty nice looking ship? Doesn't seem like something poor alcoholic junkers would be able to do.\\n\\n* Where the hell are the Knights of Ren? And what is up with the timeline? In the flashback-vision scene from TFA\\, where Luke's temple is destroyed and everything\\, we see the Knights\\, and we see that Ben is already Kylo\\, he's already got the mask and got his red lightsaber. But in the flashback scenes in TLJ\\, he's just Ben\\, he's got a blue lightsaber\\, and there are no Knights. What's going on here?\\n\\n* Rey is still a total Mary Sue. The few few things that the movie gave her to do\\, she succeeded in. They could've done so many interesting things with her character\\, embracing the fact that she instantly embraced the dark side\\, and definitely had a sincere connection with Kylo\\, but nope. She's the same Mary Sue\\, good at everything\\, plucky hero she started as in TFA.\\n\\n* Phasma is perhaps the most pointless character in the history of cinema. I was hyped for her \\\"increased role\\\" in TLJ\\, but nope\\, she's only there for Finn to easily kill her. What a disappointment.\\n\\n* So I guess the map to Luke from TFA will never be explained? Luke did explain that he didn't want anyone to find him\\, so where the hell did that map come from? And how did the old guy on Jakku get that half of the map anyway? ???\\n\\n* Finn and Rose's kiss was the WEAKEST kiss in the history of cinema.","true":true}
