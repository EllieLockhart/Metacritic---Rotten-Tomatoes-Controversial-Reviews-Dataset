Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been watching the films since 1977 at the cinema and this one may well be the best or tied with my favourite. It is a real pleasure to see the new characters develop and the amazing power of Luke in the climax of the film.","true":true}
