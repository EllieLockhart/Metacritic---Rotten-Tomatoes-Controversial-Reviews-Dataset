Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is not interested in working with in the \\\"Star Wars\\\" canon. It is part eight in a currently planed nine-part saga\\, yet it is more interested in doing its own thing even if it is to the detriment to the overall movie saga. Practically all plot lines are abandoned\\, were the previous move setup impotent characters and plot lines this movie says it does not matter and end the story lines. Fans of Star Wars will likely hate it for what it does with the characters and larger story.","true":true}
