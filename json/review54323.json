Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a huge SW fan growing up\\, and this movie is quite the letdown. I'm glad I watched it to feel closure from the series\\, but there were too many poor writing decisions made here that I simply couldn't stomach. \\n\\nIt would take a whole blog post to explain all of the things I didn't like and why\\, but to be brief this movie didn't honor the legacy SW has already created and I don't feel attached enough to the new characters to keep me watching otherwise. I love the original trilogy\\, and Rogue One was a fun addition to that\\, but this movie was the final nail in the coffin for me after some disappointment with the prequels and then the Force Awakens\\, and terrible decisions being made in this one. You should watch it to decide for yourself\\, but I think they have gone too far for a lot of fans and barely if at all considered all of the movies leading up to this one.\\n\\nIn a way this realization has been good for me\\, so I can let the hype die for me and just enjoy the SW saga that started it all.","true":true}
