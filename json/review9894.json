Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great cinematography and film.  Where it lacks is in being a star wars film. It just doesn't feel like one.  If you take out the element of it being a star wars movie\\, it's fantastic.  But if you a star wars fan\\, that is expecting a star wars movie\\, this isn't the one for you","true":true}
