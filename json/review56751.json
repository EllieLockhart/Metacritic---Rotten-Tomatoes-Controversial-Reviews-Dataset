Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie tries its best to tell 3 different stories with the characters we loved in The Force Awakens and screwed it all up. New characters such as Holdo (Leia\u00b4s second in command) were a sight for sore eyes (Spoiler: She dies saving the rest of the resistance... and it took her too long and like 20 transports destroyed before doing anything.... because plot..) also I felt like this movie re did all ESB but the wrong way... we know nothing about SNOKE (Spoiler: he is killed) and when we thing Ben Solo is back from the dark side he does his worst Vader impression about ruling the galaxy. \\n\\nIt\u00b4s a huge slap in the face for long time fans and not a single plot was resolved in the entire movie\\, the only good thing I can say they did really good was the last scene of the movie displaying hope for the galaxy and thats all.\\n\\nDONT WASTE YOUR MONEY #MakeStarWarsGreatAgain!","true":true}
