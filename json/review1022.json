Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Another great adventure in the Star Wars Galaxy! The entire cast brought their A game and did an excellent job. The film was emotional\\, action packed\\, and full of twists and turns. It was very different and a lot to digest\\, a real evolution for the Star Wars franchise moving forward for the next generation. Was it perfect? No\\, but still a great film.","true":true}
