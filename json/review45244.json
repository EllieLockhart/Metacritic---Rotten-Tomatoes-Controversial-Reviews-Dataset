Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unusual but amazing. It turns the Star Wars universe upside down by boldly abandoning the formula we've been accustomed to in the other movies and does it brilliantly. It is also maybe the Star Wars movie with the most emotional depth.","true":true}
