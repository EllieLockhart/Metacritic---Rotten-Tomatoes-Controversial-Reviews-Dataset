Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The problem with the film is this.... it's not feel-good in any way. After watching it you just feel kinda depressed. The plot destroys everything that was so likeable about Luke Skywalker\\, yet another eye-rolling case of the film industry's obsession with showing every good-guy becoming bitter \/ jaded \/ evil \/ a failure. And that's just the problem - they may be trying to make the point that everyone is human and flawed - a very valid point - but that's not why people go to the cinema to watch Star Wars! They go for a bit of feel-good escapism with their kids! And this was just a bit too depressing\\, and felt a bit too political too - in a way that will probably not age well\\, and be seen in retrospect as a bit propaganda-ish in some ways too. Solo\\,\\, a film that took itself less seriously\\, was more kid-friendly\\, and less political was much better\\, in my view at least.","true":true}
