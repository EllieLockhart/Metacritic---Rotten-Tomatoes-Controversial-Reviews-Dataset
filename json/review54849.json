Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It may be hard for some (those hardcore original trilogy fans of many years)\\, burn as long as you can let go of your expectations for that Skywalker centric story that so many are desperately looking for\\, this movie is an expert addition to the Star Wars universe. It has everything you'd hope for\\, minus that one thing that is dragging the ratings down Fuentes to those original trilogy's fanatics because it isn't what they were expecting. Expectations are the cause of the negativity\\, and director Rian Johnson had the guts to tell those with high expectations\\, \\\"we're moving on\\, and it's ok. This isn't the same story as 40 years ago\\\". And it isn't. It's something completely new now\\, with characters that a new generation of children are growing up watching and idolizing\\, because that's what Star Wars is. Each trilogy has brought something new to the table for the new youth\\, and as the prequels are increasingly accepted along with the aging of the children who watched them\\, I think it's safe to expect the same thing in the long run for this creative\\, fun-loving\\, epic\\, emotional\\, question-raising trilogy. This movie certainly sets up a challenge for J.J Abrams\\, but hopefully he'll provide the closure that all fans are now desperately in need of.","true":true}
