Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While easily not as boring as Force Awakens\\, Last Jedi tramples over it's source material at every turn\\, fails to turn it's bland characters into likeable do-gooders\/villains\\, and takes an abundance of logical missteps and jumps the shark enough to make a drinking out of the whole affair. At the end of day\\, it's still the most enjoyable of the Disney Star Wars entries\\, but that's not much of a compliment.","true":true}
