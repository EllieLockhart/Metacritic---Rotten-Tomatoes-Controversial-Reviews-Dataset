{"101487":136624,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-03-20","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm just a long term fan\\, and this is my first review here\\, but I felt I needed to add my voice here. I was 10 when StarWars came out in 1977. I even enjoyed episodes 1\\,2\\,3. I saw LastJedi and came out thinking hmm that was kind of fun\\, but also felt something was wrong\\, and then it hit me. This was not Star Wars. The fan movies on youtube were better than this thing. But in the end I really disliked what they did to the old heroes. This seemed like a case of \\\"we need to make the old characters look bad to make our new look good\\\". There are so many good stories they could have told after ReturnOfTheJedi but their best idea is \\\"Han and Leia are bad parents\\, raise a kid who turns to the dark side\\, gives up and divorce\\, Luke gives up and goes away to hide on an island\\, and politics are boring so even though the entire franchise makes a big deal about philosophy\/force\/political forces\\, lets just make a simple action story. Why couldn't they leave the old characters alone\\, let them die heroes before these movies start and just start up a new story 100 years after ReturnOfTheJedi. Maybe the younger generations likes this\\, maybe they are totally loving these characters\\, maybe they like the no-story but lots of action plot\\, maybe I'm not the demographic anymore. Well if that's the case... you succeeded. This is not StarWars for me and I have no interest in seeing anymore from the WaltStarDisneyWars universe. Disney you should have stuck to Tron and made that into a franchise series.","true":true}
