Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I'd just like to say as a start im not sure why everyone hates this game. Maybe by those who got spoiled it was hard to see character decisions being made when they were made. Maybe there's another agenda that they find offensive for no reason. But all that aside I thought this was a great game the story was done well characters were well written and most of all   it was well executed i think playing the game and experiencing the story without it being spoiled made it a lot easier to see the events unfold I feel as if you were to have told me prior i would be confused and not understand why this happened and get upset with this plot. By seeing the story payout the way it did amazed me and tugged on my heart in all different ways. Playing this game made me appreciate the relationship between Joel and ellie that much more and the new character Abby was amazing\\, she showed me that behind every death theres someone who cared for them and what lengths some people will go through to make others suffer like she did and in the end regret it. Seeing ellie get over his death in the end and not killing abby was the most adult thing she could do and probably took everything in her to not finish the job. One last thing I want to mention is the guitar in this game\\, in the beginning you start as joel and you hand the guitar to ellie then you play as her in the end ellie sets that guitar down and the screen no longer focuses on her. The story is over and it was an excellent job I cant wait to see what Naughtydog does next!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
