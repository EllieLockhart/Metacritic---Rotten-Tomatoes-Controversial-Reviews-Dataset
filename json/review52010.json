Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After a very decent Force Awakens\\, the Last Jedi was overly Disneyfied\\, and did not jive with the intrigue or quality of previous films.  The movie lacked in character development but had an abundance of campy comedy that was no doubt injected by Disney.  Characters in the film were made disposable for the sake of a quick laugh or shock.  Heroes were assumed instead of created.  I recommend picking this up when the box set goes on sale.","true":true}
