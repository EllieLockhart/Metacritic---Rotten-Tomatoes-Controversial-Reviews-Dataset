Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it! Best one since Empire! Rose is a refreshing addition to the franchise\\, and the various themes explored in the movie tied into every single character. The biggest shock of the movie is there for everyone to see at the end of the film\\, but intentionally left vague so that it can play out in part 9. It was a masterfully directed film\\, with a great script\\, and Hamil delivered the performance of his career.","true":true}
