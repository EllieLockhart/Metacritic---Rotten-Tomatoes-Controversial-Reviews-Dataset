Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love the Star Wars franchise. I have ever since I was a kid.  This movie had an interesting plot and was pretty good\\, it just was missing something I can't put my finger on. To all of the hardcore Star Wars fans like me however\\, you should definitely watch it because it's a nice addition to the series and it can't get any worse than the prequels. Hahaha","true":true}
