Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this movie was amazing\\, so many things were unexpected and I loved that. All the performances were fantastic. This Star Wars movie is different from others\\, and it made me think about the movie and the characters for weeks after I saw it and I wanted to keep going back to learn and understand more\\, and thats what I think a great film does. This film makes me so excited for episode 9.","true":true}
