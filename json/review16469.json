Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm sure many Star Wars fans out there will know what I mean when I say it physically hurts when a Star Wars film is bad. The Last Jedi was one of these times. I left the cinema desperately trying to convince myself that what I had just watched was secretly a masterpiece\\, instead of complete bollocks; but the more you think about The Last Jedi\\, the more you begin to realise it's filled with character inconsistencies\\, plot holes\\, ill-timed humour\\, vacuous characters\\, and a complete disregard for the Star Wars mythos and lore. Avoid.","true":true}
