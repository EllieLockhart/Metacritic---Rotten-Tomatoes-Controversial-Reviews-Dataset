{"101487":133186,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-24","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I grew up loving Star Wars. It was the epitome of my youth and for my generation(Gen Y)\\, seeing Star Wars continue was a dream come true... until The Last Jedi. As a whole this was a decent movie; however there are too many holes\\, problems\\, and inconsistencies for this to be a movie worthy of the title \\\"Part of the Star Wars Franchise\\\".\\n**THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS************************\\n\\nLet's start with the good:\\nWe saw Yoda. They used their lightsabers\\, and we saw some cool use oft he Jedi skills.\\nNow for the bad:\\n1) Luke's character. Luke\\, as was created and written in the original franchise\\, would NEVER try to kill his nephew because he SENSED the dark in him?!?! Not true to the character.\\n2) Snoke was killed as if it was a minor thing. Snoke was the bad guy\\, the villain\\, and he was killed that easy???? Sorry but no. It was a \\\"quick fix\\\" to get rid of him without dealing with him.\\n3) Kylo Ren\\, aka Ben Solo\\, turned evil BECAUSE HIS UNCLE TRIED TO KILL HIM????????? REALLY?!?!?! I'm not buying that. Another cop out to avoid having to include a backstory or the prequel to this one.\\n4) The general who replaces Leia decides to abandon ship for no reason whatsoever\\, and doesn't inform her crew? That's just weak leadership. AND they cut way too many of her scenes. They didn't show this character accurately.\\n5) This was meant to be the darkest film of the trilogy\\, and they turned it into a \\\"happy\\, happy\\, everything's great\\\" BABY FILM! The darkest film was no longer the darkest film. It turned into a \\\"happy sunshine\\\" everything's great\\, let's show how teamwork is wonderful lame and BULL.........\\n6) Kylo \\\"knows\\\" who Rey's parents are? Really? Someone with that much force is a freakin' nobody??!?!?!?!?!\\n7) The CUT scenes. They cut so much out\\, that they ruined the movie! There was supposed to be a scene that explains the tree Luke burns down\\, but because the legend he tells that explains said tree\\, was \\\"too religious\\\" they cut it. Seriously\\, a legend of light and dark was \\\"Too religious\\\"? Get a grip.\\n8) This movie breaks way too much canon. \\n9) The \\\"I'm saving you\\\" chick. REALLY!?! HE WAS SAVING THE ENTIRE REBELLION! She was a useless character. USELESS.\\n\\nOverall\\, this movie needs to be stricken from the records and rereleased with the cut scenes added back in.","true":true}
