Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A complete SJW sh@tshow\\, ruining a great character of sw history. Very annoying to see Rey being completely capable of doing anything\\, beating anyone and succeeding in everything she does. If this was a game\\, it would have come with an Invincible mode at default. Who cares for such characters\\, who enjoys this for real and who was responsible for such uninspiring story telling ?!? Leia turning into Mary Poppins and the whole Rose Tico part also contributes that this movie became the last Star Wars product I would ever want to see. Awaiting a new generation of writers\\, producers\\, directors and Lucasfilm employees. Until this franchise I dead and buried to me.","true":true}
