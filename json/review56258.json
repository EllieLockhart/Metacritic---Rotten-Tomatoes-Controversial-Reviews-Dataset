Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars - The Last Jedi is the latest creation of a petty-minded\\, middle-aged\\, jealous kid who's trying to make a name by destroying the life's work of a real visionary with politics and social justice ideology. Anyone who disagrees has to look at Mark Hamil's face when he realizes after the premiere that this kid has just killed his character just to prove he's on the longer lever. Mark has repeatedly tried to warn the fans during the filming and that should bring him this small-minded revenge. Anyway\\, the child has managed one thing. He has brought his name on everyone's lips and no matter how the Star Wars Francise goes on\\, you will never forget him and his deeds. If he tried to gain immortality in this way\\, he somehow succeeded.","true":true}
