Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This would be a fine movie if it was the first and only Star Wars film. But as part of a larger canon\\, this film is a huge disappointment. First\\, enough with the forced diversity. The three young heroes are a white female\\, a black male\\, and an asian female. And the villain is a white male. A little obvious\\, no? That's a level of pandering that's just embarrassing and inauthentic. Second\\, that's not Luke Skywalker. He was a hero and source of hope (A New Hope\\, in fact) for people who wanted to be inspired. You killed our hope. Third\\, way to throw away a potentially great villain in Snoke. Rian Johnson cared more about being different as a director than he did about the story and IP he was working with. When you direct a Star Wars story\\, it's not about you. It's about something bigger than you. Something that millions of people love and respect. This was a failure in that regard. On a positive note\\, it was well shot.","true":true}
