Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The storytelling is weak with this one.  Conflicts with previous plot lines\\, characters doing things against their fundamental nature\\, and a complete failure to wrap up loose ends leave this movie feeling like Rian Johnson didn't pay any attention to the foundation on which he built this movie.\\n\\nIt was fun to watch as long as you don't try to think at all about the plot or how the story should all fit together.  If you try to put the pieces together\\, it all falls apart and leaves you wondering why there isn't a consistent story (like in the MCU).  If your expectations aren't too high\\, and you don't expect a consistent storyline\\, you might escape disappointment. I did not.","true":true}
