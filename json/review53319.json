Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*cracks knuckles*  Ok\\, where shall we begin?  There is both good and bad in this movie\\, so let's start with the good:  a lighter\/more fun tone\\, cool space battles\\, Rey\\, Kylo Ren\\, Poe Dameron\\, and (surprisingly) Luke Skywalker.  The bad:  pretty much everyone else (and there is a LOT of everyone else)\\, painfully long running time\\, an almost insulting lack of logic to the story\\, exactly the same plot elements from the original trilogy (AGAIN!!)\\, and copious unintentionally hilarious moments.  You can see from this list that the bad outweighs the good.  There are parts where I literally facepalmed\\, it was so bad.  But\\, those parts were counteracted by some pretty satisfying ones\\, too.  The quiet\\, character-driven moments are the most successful\\, while the big sequences are so busy that they are almost numbing... and most are pointless as well.  The movie hits you right off the bat with a jarringly different tone - it's peppered with sarcasm\/snarky humor\\, which has never happened in a SW film before.  Unfortunately\\, most of the jokes don't really land and have the counter-affect of making a tonal clusterfuck of the entire film.  Maybe kids will think the gags are funny\\, but to me they were marginally cute at best (NOTE: I did laugh out loud quite a bit\\, it just wasn't when I was supposed to).  My biggest beef with this movie is the sameness of it all.  Everyone is saying how this movie is so much different than previous SW films\\, which is baffling to me because other than the tone\\, it's exactly the same as all the others.  It (once again!) rehashes classic plot elements from the original trilogy\\, sometimes quite literally with exactly the same dialogue... and goddammit\\, I'm so sick of being given the same movie again and again and being expected to love it.  There are only a few plot elements that are original to this story\\, and those were the best parts\\, so why didn't they do more of it??   ARG.  I get it\\, making a good Star Wars movie is a tall order\\, and I appreciate Rian Johnson's attempt to break out of the box at least a little bit... and it isn't as terribly predictable and formulaic as \\\"The Force Awakens\\\".  But it's still saddled with the bad dialogue\\, subpar character development\\, and silly plot devices that have plagued all the Star Wars movies since 2001 (and to be totally honest\\, the original trilogy has its share of all of that stuff as well).   It's a fun movie\\, in the way that all Star Wars movies are fun... but let's not kid ourselves\\, this movie is a mess\\, and I imagine it will only get less cohesive\/less popular upon multiple viewings.","true":true}
