Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Judged as a movie alone\\, The Last Jed is a catastrophic failure of basic storytelling and narrative logic. Judged as a Star Wars movie\\, it is calculated to disappoint and frustrate the fans who have supported this franchise and to betray it's basic contract with the audience: to entertain. Instead\\, the Last Jedi is a political medium saying that women are the true heroes\\, men are either evil or fueled entirely by emotion\\, that heroism is not about sacrifice--unless it is done by a woman. Essentially\\, it's main message is that men and women cannot co-exist on equal terms in peace.","true":true}
