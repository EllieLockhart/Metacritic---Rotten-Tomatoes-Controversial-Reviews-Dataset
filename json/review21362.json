Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I will not be seeing this movie. I was very hesitant because I was not impressed with TFA so I wanted to read the reviews first and see what it was all about. Well\\, this movie will not get one red cent from my pocketbook. Disney has destroyed Star Wars even more than Lucas did with the prequels. Hollywood will never learn. I will stick with the original UNALTERED trilogy as Star Wars.","true":true}
