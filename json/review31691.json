Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sorry. Mostly the same story with different names. Nothing new to see here. I love the original movies. Disney needs to move on from this storyline and make more stand alone movies like Rogue One. Looking forward to the Han Solo movie. Wont see The Last Jedi a second time.","true":true}
