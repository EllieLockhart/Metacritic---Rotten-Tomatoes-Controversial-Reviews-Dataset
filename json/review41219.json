Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie hurt me and my dad as die hard fans at how they killed off important characters way to soon\\, at how they left so many crazy storylines from the force awakens behind\\, it hurt and a real fan that they didn\u2019t care and how they only made a movie for the normies and the the REAL FANS","true":true}
