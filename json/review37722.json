Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There was a lot of storytelling that could have been done well and mysteries solved or furthered from episode 7. However\\, they trampled on those  plots\\, and made a movie with way too many stories. A bunch of so so plots does not equal up to a good one. I never need to see this movie again because it was unenjoyable.","true":true}
