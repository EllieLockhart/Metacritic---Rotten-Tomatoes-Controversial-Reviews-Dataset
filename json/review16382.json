Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm quite sorry for the fanboys Star Wars audience is made from. This is a marvellous film\\, Rey is amazing\\, forgiving and relatable in her hope in others\\, like her parents\\, the resistance\\, Luke\\, now Ben. As well a character that still is developing\\, and I'm in awe the way it is going.\\nLike\\, everytime we see a movie\\, it is almost ALWAYS lead by the MALE gaze\\, because in this fucking industry\\, woman are treated like pretty dolls to play with\\, not humans. But not here\\, and not this time! I pray for Carrie Fisher the space mom and Ryan Jhonson\\, JJ abrams and fucking Kathleen Kennedy\\, everyone forgets the producer\\, but I know the motherfucking work it is. Thank you for this inspiring piece of art\\, for inspiring girls and womam to be leaders. And the fact that Luke\\, the wise teacher\\, also fails\\, tells a lot to me personaly\\, because some of us\\, since child\\, are tought to belive in the elders without doubt\\, or to believe that \\\"legends\\\" are legends and not humans still learning like us.  \\nSo... high hopes for the continuation of this epic romance. Mr. Darcy sure has to overcome his pride and hurt yet.","true":true}
