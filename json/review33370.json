Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Take all the Mystery that surrounds what the new trilogy had started with \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d and throw it out the window. It\u2019s as if Rian Johnson had a chip on his shoulder about the first film and set out to erase any of the lore it created. That said there were some incredible scenes within the movie but all in all it was a waste of time.","true":true}
