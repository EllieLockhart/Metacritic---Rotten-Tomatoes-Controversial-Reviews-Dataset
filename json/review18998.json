Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's definitely a departure from any Star Wars films I seen\\, and though I was expecting the fate of one of my beloved characters\\, I didn't quite envision it happening the way it did. But I'm not a film director. Johnson's vision is bold and risky and though it has not landed with that infamous demographic that pretty much trashtalks any new Star wars film\\, it stuck its landing with the rest.","true":true}
