Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While The Force Awakens felt like deja vu for everything that made star wars iconic\\, The Last Jedi left it behind. We find ourselves with a villian with a more compelling back story than the Anakin to Vader evolution. We find a whole cast that is dedicated to their cause so fervently that neither side of the conflict backs down.  We see multiple groups of protagonists tehuing different methods to achieve their goal and not all of them work. There is a complexity of plot and character  new to Star Wars.\\n\\nThe story encourages the little people to rise up against oppression\\, not just those that have space magic. It tells you that even if an attempt fails\\, you can keep going and there is always hope.\\n\\nIt was great to see the cast continuing to add diverse characters and have women in command positions. Going into this movie I was sceptical\\, but I am now excited to see the direction this franchise is going.","true":true}
