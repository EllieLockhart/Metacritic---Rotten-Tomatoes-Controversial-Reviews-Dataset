Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"??There are many issues with this film that can't simply be hand-waved away by claims of entitled fans who just didn't ~understand~ the central message. In my opinion\\, The Last Jedi isn't even a good movie\\, let alone a good addition to the Star Wars franchise.\\n\\nThe movie has many structural issues: the plots are weak and meandering and there are many scenes that drag without building tension or character (this was certainly my first experience of being bored and distracted while watching a Star Wars movie). It's at least 45 minutes too long\\, and builds up to at least 3 finales\\, each of which felt like a natural ending only for the film to continue as though the director was determined to shoe-horn in as much as possible regardless of the cost to the narrative structure.\\n\\nMy main complaint about TLJ is that the plots and conflicts (and lessons learned) feel very contrived. A lot has been spoken about the way that this movie shows our heroes failing\\, and whether that has caused a negative reaction in fans who are not used to that. For me\\, the central issue is not the portrayal of failure in itself but the fact that many characters are made to act in ways that feel out-of-character and it's clear that this has been done simply as a means to an end to ensure that specific plot points are hit. Most key actions\/inactions don't feel convincing and some make no logical sense when scrutinised beyond \\\"Rian Johnson needed the character to do x so that y would happen later\\\". This is very much a movie where plot requirements dictate character actions\\, rather than the other way round\\, and it's very frustrating to watch.\\n\\nThis will be the only Star Wars movie that I won't be watching more than once. 1\/5.","true":true}
