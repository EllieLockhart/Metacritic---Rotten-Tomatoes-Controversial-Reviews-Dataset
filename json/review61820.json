My opinion on TLOU2 is a story told through a game where you are more than a passive listening. There are dramatic points where you physically progress the story and those moments stand out for me. I would suggest this game to any adult and ask them to step into the story and let it carry them. It's possible they may find it uninteresting or hate it entirely\\, which it totally fine\\, but I think it's something everyone should experience.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
