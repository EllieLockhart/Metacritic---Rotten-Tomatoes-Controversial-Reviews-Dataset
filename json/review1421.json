Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a die hard Star Wars fan\\, this movie just stole away everything that Star Wars stands for. No spirit\\, no coherency\\, and so many plotholes\\, that even the plotholes have plotholes.\\n\\nThe Force Awakens was basically a copy of A New Hope.\\nThe Last Jedi was basically a copy of Empire Strikes Back\\, with elements of Return of the Jedi.\\n\\nThe Phantom Menace is no longer the worst Star Wars film. There's a new champion - The Last Jedi.\\n\\nThis film does not have a Star Wars feel to it - This film is not Star Wars.","true":true}
