Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars yet\\, In 1977 I was eight years old when my dad took me to see Star Wars. The first 3 were awesome the next 3 were decent they built on the saga\\, the 7th one was good\\, the one that went back to show how the resistance got the Death Star plans was one of the best since Return of the Jedi. \\nThis movie the last Jedi was horrible \\, I was pissed at the jokes and the stupid Superman act by Leia . By that point I was ready to exit the movie. This movie was a disgrace to the whole saga and the life lessons learned in the originals.\\nThis shows what happens when mellineals and he quest for quick profit get in the way of good movie making. They did not even take the time to cover up all the mistakes in this movie. The next one sure as hell better makeup for this garbage or it will be my last film I spend money on. By the way I watch in theater and buy them.","true":true}
