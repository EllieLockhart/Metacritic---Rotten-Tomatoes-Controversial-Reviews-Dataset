Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked: J.Williams's score. Some wow scenes. \\nI did not like: the story\\, how characters are treated. There are so many massive and blatant flaws to the writing that it begs the question of whether Johnson and Kennedy are blinded by their own hubris. The choices are controversial and I personally I left the movie a bit heart broken. Okay clearly Disney and Kennedy dont' care as I won't be buying any toys: I am white male\\, late 30's\\, grew up with SW and Luke as my childhood hero. \u00ab\u00a0Kill it if you have to\u00a0\u00bbsays Kylo about the past. Johnson killed a bit of me in this movie. \\n\\nAlso it looks like Johnson never spoke to J.J. Abrams - nothing connects and most of the plots lend completely flat with no emotional impact but one of frustration and waste of screen time.\\n\\nI am for the first time in my life not really excited about what's coming next in the saga. Too bad.","true":true}
