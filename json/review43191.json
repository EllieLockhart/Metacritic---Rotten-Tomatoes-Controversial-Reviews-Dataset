Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This so called Star Wars films does a disservice to the original characters\\, story and fans. It dishonors the saga and replaces it with a dumbed down\\, reduced galaxy and one dimensional characters. It inserts current American politics and social commentary while trying for laughs with insipid and unfunny jokes.","true":true}
