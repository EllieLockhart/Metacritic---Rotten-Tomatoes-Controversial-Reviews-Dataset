Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing but still enjoyable entry in the \\\"Star Wars\\\" franchise\\, that while a misstep by Disney after the excellent \\\"Force Awakens\\\" & \\\"Rogue One\\\"\\, doesn't represent the end of the series as many of its deriders state.  The cast is solid across the board\\, with all the returning members doing excellent work.  Mark Hamill in particular shines as an older\\, more jaded Luke Skywalker\\, while Daisy Ridley  remains the best new hero to the series in years.  The biggest problems are behind the camera\\, with Rian Johnson crafting some excellent action pieces but suffers from making the movie too funny & cute at times (the Porgs are fun but overdone).  The film is also too long\\, with too many side plots (a journey to a casino planet\\, along with a new character\\, are completely unneeded & could have been cut).  However\\, the film does make some nice twists against expectations\\, from the revelation of Rey's parents to her relationship with Kylo\\, that shows some fresh ideas mixed in.  Overall\\, not the best of the \\\"Star Wars\\\" films\\, but still fun and far from the worst.","true":true}
