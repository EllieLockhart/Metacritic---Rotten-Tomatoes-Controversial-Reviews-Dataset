Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A film riddled with poor moments between some really great moments. If The Last Jedi could be described in a word it would be inconsistent. The film's paced very well and has some genuinely epic moments. However\\, between all this there are sub par subplots and a failure to tackle any of the big questions raised in The Force Awakens.","true":true}
