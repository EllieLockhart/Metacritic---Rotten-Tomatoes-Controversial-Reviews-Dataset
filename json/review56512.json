{"101487":174671,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-02","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The good news is that TLJ is _slightly_ better than The Farce Awakens. The bad news is\\, of course\\, that this is not hard to do. It is weird\\, if not amusing\\, to me to see how Episode 8 gets bashed for not addressing all the nonsense introduced in Ep.7. Why did Ep.7 not take the heat for its own crap? Just like its predecessor\\, TLJ is well done at one thing and one thing ONLY: visuals. It looks great\\, and that is about it. Mind you\\, this does not even include visual _storytelling_ ! There is so much that is transported in stupid dialogue instead of showing us its consequences.YouTube is full of well-crafted videos that mercilessly dissect all the stupid nonsense in this movie\\, but since TLJ - just like its predecessor - is a blatant rip-off of original trilogy material\\, I suggest starting with \\\"Empire Strikes Back: The Last Jedi Edition\\\" and \\\"If Luke Were Rey - A New Hope: Mary Sue Edition\\\". For those more resilient\\, feel free to dive into the hours of material on YT pointing out all the BS with capital B and capital S in this \\\"emotion-rich action\\\" piece. It amazes me how trained professionals are unable - or unwilling - to point out the most obvious copy-and-paste as well as massive flaws in storytelling: STILL no character development in Rey - how can I root for a hero character who does not _earn_ anything? And that's not even addressing the stupid casino side quest which could be cut without replacement and without anyone noticing.\\nSo what IS The Last Jedi? It is a cheap rip-off of Empire\\, it disappoints EVERY major bit of foreshadowing of its predecessor\\, it does NOT learn from the mistakes of its predecessor\\, and it is still merely fan fiction. And it is still a major achievement in turd polishing. Looks fabulous\\, but don't get too close\\, or the smell will drive you away.","true":true}
