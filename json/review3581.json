Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Best Star Wars movie since Empire Strikes Back. Finally\\, they've got subtext without opposition\\, complexity in the relationship between Crime\/Rebellion\/Empire\\, complexity in the Jedi\/Sith\\, complexity in what it means to be a hero\\, a story that embraces the spirit of the originals while simultaneously forging it's own path\\, and a story of corruption seen all the way through.\\n\\nIt sometimes feels like I just saw a different movie than everyone. I'm a huge fan too (not of the prequels as much\\, but I still enjoy them for popcorn flicks.) But the broader universe? Clone Wars\\, all the games\\, the RPGs\\, the MMO\\, Rebels\\, the extended universe? I'm a fan. This movie has depth\\, nuance\\, and complexity. It reminded me of being young\\, watching the original Star Wars\\, and remembering all the questions it raised.","true":true}
