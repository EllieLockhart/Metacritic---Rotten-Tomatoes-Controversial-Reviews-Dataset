Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Waited my whole life to see Luke Skywalker back in action after \\\"Return of the Jedi\\\" and I could not have been more disappointed with this movie. Mark Hamill's character was completely mishandled for the benefit of a new cast of boring characters that feel completely shoehorned into the movie.","true":true}
