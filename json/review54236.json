Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you love not knowing what the next second will hold\\, love being set up for a certain expectation only for the movie to throw that expectation out a second story window\\, love being on the edge of your seat because it's obvious that YES the director would be 100% willing to go THERE because nothing is so sacred as to be immune to his wishes\\, You Will Love This Movie.\\n\\nIf you don't like all of the above and are expecting the movie to follow the tried and true Star Wars movie format\\, you may enjoy a few scenes but ultimately you're probably going to be disappointed and end up hating the movie.","true":true}
