Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie. I liked that things surprised me--the twists\\, the cameos\\, the new world. I like that the film mirrored The Empire Strikes Back in some ways\\, but was not a copy--for example: Seeing the Resistance walk into the old Rebel base on Cait\\, brought to mind the hastily abandoned Echo Base on Hoth. Here the heroes were using the base as a refuge\\, a place to make their last stand. I liked the expanded Force powers. Communicating over long distances via the Force has been shown before\\, but not to this degree. And what Luke does?  Amazing. The portion of the film on Canto Blight seemed like a throw away until the end. Then it made sense. I only wish Lando Calrissian had made a cameo at one of the tables! I've never posted a review here before\\, but I don't like the idea of a group of people \\\"review bombing\\\" a film. I'm a die hard Star Wars fan. I was 11 years old when the original was released. Nothing will ever be as magical as seeing that galaxy come to life for the first time in 1977. The Empire Strikes Back is still my favorite (I really don't think anything will ever top it for me)\\, but The Last Jedi has succeeded in keeping the franchise moving forward.","true":true}
