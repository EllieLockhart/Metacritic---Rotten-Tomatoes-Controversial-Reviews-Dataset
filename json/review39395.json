Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film isn't Star Wars\\, it's a corporate rehash of the original films and an absolute disgrace to film making and originality in general. Utterly atrocious mercantile junk\\, with no soul or inspiration. Again\\, this is not Star Wars.","true":true}
