{"101487":141836,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-29","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It looks pretty on the screen\\, the actors do a good job mostly\\, but it does not make up for how incredibly flawed this movie is. If visuals are enough for you and if you're not particularly attached to Star Wars\\, then this is for you.  \\n\\nThe movie just isn't exciting\\, it's long\\, it's boring and whenever it gains tempo or starts to become exciting there is a cut to a scene which is simply not interesting at all\\, destroying what little excitement the movie managed to build up.\\nIt is impossible to be thrilled or excited for any scene\\, because you know that the protagonist will manage it without even a single scratch\\,\\neven in the seemingly most desperate situations. You can't get thrilled or excited because you know that there will be a cheap Deus Ex Machina to save the day\\, or rather the flawed script. Big interesting questions that had been created by the Force Awakens are answered with an explanation that feels cheap and flatout insulting to the viewer. And while coming up with these cheap solutions\\, the movie destroys basic logic and established rules and characters of the Star Wars Universe from the Original Trilogy and the Prequels.\\nIt basically copies large chunks of Return of the Jedi and the Empire strikes back\\, it just arranges them in another chronological order.\\nWhat little originality this movie has\\, is surprisingly bad and utterly pointless.\\nI did not believe that it could be as bad as this\\, but it was. It carries cheap political messages\\, ill placed jokes that are even worse than the ones seen in other movies of this series. The movie is aimed at a female audience. What they didn't realise though\\, is that it was a bad idea to not have any single strong male lead in this movie. Every single male character needs to be saved or tutored by a strong female character\\, while the opposite situation is never the case. I assume this is where the SJW arguments come from. While I accepted a lot of things that The Force Awakens shoved down my throat\\, even it's lack of originality\\, I can't do it for this movie anymore. There were other possibilities how this movie could have been saved or made more interesting. Yet\\, despite having so much funds they came up with such cheap ideas. Here some spoiler examples for cheap solutions: \\nLuke is on that Island because he was frightened by Kylo Ren's dark side\\, which seemed to be worse than Vader's for some reason. He then thought about murdering the son of his beloved sister in his sleep\\, because he was convinced that his darkness could not be converted (which is funny\\, considering Vader). Kylo then noticed this and destroyed the temple without any clear resistance. Luke went onto the island and gave up on everything.\\nThe first order developed a Hyperspace tracking device (it took them 7 movies to make such an obvious thing). To escape said tracking device\\, a glorious newly introduced female admiral of the resistance (not Ackbar\\, he is killed offscreen) does a Hyperspace Jump into the First Order fleet\\, which destroys the majority of the First Order fleet. (why wasn't this done countless times before and automatised? It makes space battles unnecessary if one ship is enough to destroy almost an entire fleet).\\nThere are many more logical flaws to find in this movie and other cheap solutions\\, misused characters and jokes and cringy dialogue. It does look pretty on screen though and if youre not much into Star Wars\\, it may be entertaining enough.","true":true}
