Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ruined the mythology. Destroyed Luke. Dire script. Underdeveloped new characters to the point where I couldn't care less about the next film. And this is from someone who the star wars mythology and Luke Skywalker changed a shy young boy into believing in the force and later the the magic of crafting a film. This film does none of that In a world where critics consensus can be so far off the public's perception. And where Disney who after the acquisition of fox now rule Hollywood\\, and see nothing wrong with withholding a critic from attending advanced screenings because the publication dares publish something negative about it. It makes me wonder what critics really felt and if any of them will have the bravery to amend their reviews in line with the real world.","true":true}
