Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What in God's name did I just watch?\\n\\nTo be clear\\, I'm not one of those insufferable Star Wars fans that is impossible to please. The Force Awakens was among my favorite of the saga\\, but the direction Rian Johnson took the story and its characters was neither \\\"bold\\\" nor \\\"brave.\\\" It was just nonsensical. Ridiculous. Subverting the audience's expectations for the sake of shock value isn't good storytelling. It's hackery. Everything I loved about Star Wars has been destroyed. A terrific cast and an abundance of talent behind the camera have been squandered. \\n\\nThe film was an absolute mess: gaping plot holes\\, entire sequences that could have been omitted entirely\\, new characters that served literally no purpose\\, a lack of practical effects in favor of a gratuitous CGI\\, and alas\\, a gross perversion of the Star Wars mythology. How did Kathleen Kennedy approve this script? Rian was supposed to be LucasFilm's golden boy? What happened? It's been said by many\\, but I'll say it again; to say I am disappointed by this move would be an understatement.","true":true}
