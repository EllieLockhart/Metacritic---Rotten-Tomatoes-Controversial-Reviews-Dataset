Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Keeps getting worse\\, I thought the force awakens was bad. Disney just used the movie to introduce new products for them to sale\\, while ruining the franchise. Writing was terrible which is to be expected in this new trilogy\\, storyline was weak\\, the franchise can't come back from this \\, it's to deep. Star wars as we know it is dead.","true":true}
