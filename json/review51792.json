Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A dull narrative\\, wasted story points\\, ruining both the classic characters and the ones they try to build up\\, The Last Jedi proved fans are not content with modern Hollywood tropes in an iconic film franchise. Yes this movie made plenty of money\\, but Solo being a finanical failure shows the future of the franchise will have to prove itself to find favor with its fans again. We'll see what happens with Episode IX (that is if I want to go see it)","true":true}
