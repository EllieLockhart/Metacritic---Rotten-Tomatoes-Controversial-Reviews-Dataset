Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I remember after I came out of the theater trying to convince myself that I might have kind of enjoyed the movie a little. I remember waking up the next morning thinking\\, \\\"what the heck was that?!\\\" The movie looked beautiful and had a lot of potential. Don't get me wrong\\, if this was not a Star Wars movie it would have gotten at least a three star from me. But given that it belongs to a saga\\, there must be a certain level of continuity and feel that should have met that did not meet. This movie became (not exaggerating) the most disappointing movie I have seen in my entire life. The movie left such a sour taste that I basically lost all interest in everything Star Wars. Mainly because it made all previous movies and shows before it meaningless. I will probably watch episode nine on Google play or red box. Maybe the next one will cause people to care about the franchise again. Who knows?","true":true}
