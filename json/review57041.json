Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is a Hugh cluster of a director wanting to do his own thing\\, advancing social\/political narratives over constructing a decent plot\\, and setting himself up for his own trilogy of films instead of focusing on the task at hand in making a great sequel to The Force Awakens.\\n\\nAlmost everything misses the mark in this film and it's place within the Star Wars lure\/canon. Instead of writing out all of the problems with this film\\, I will list them as I'm sure you've seen this film and have an idea of what I'm talking about.\\n\\n-Time: We're led to believe that this film takes place over a course of 12 or so hours while the First Order engages the Resistance in a OJ Simpsonesque - low speed chase. However multiple days pass while Rey is on the island with Luke. This film is supposed to pick up right after TFA. How is this possible?\\n- The unnecessary inclusion of Laura Dern's character. Who is she? Where did she come from? Star Wars is now relying on it's audience to read supplemental material instead of adding exposition in the film. This character in every way could have been played by Admiral Ackbar \\, a legendary character who deserved more than a briefly mentioned off screen death.\\n\\nYou know this movie is no good. I don't need to keep going. I just hope Disney sees this and realizes they're actively ruining a classic franchise.","true":true}
