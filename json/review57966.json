Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When I first saw this movie I too felt disappointed.  All my theories about certain characters were completely different to the events that take place in the movie\\, some parts didn't make sense because I was too excited\\, and in general I had no idea what to make of it.  When I saw it a second time with an audience of mainly children\\, filled with wonderment and love for the new characters\\, I finally understood. \\n \\nOne of the themes of this movie is about letting go of the past\\, and that's exactly what Rian has done.  Letting go and establishing a new direction for Star Wars.\\n\\nIt's a movie that teaches us that sometimes heroes don't always get happy endings.  Sometimes being a hero and legend has unexpected pitfalls when you cling to the old ways of your teachers\\, resulting in terrible mistakes.  Sometimes a hero needs to fail before they can become stronger.  Sometimes the past is not easily forgotten\\, sometimes ones origins doesn't dictate who they are.  Rian addresses and concludes these issues alongside some of the most beautiful cinematics I've ever seen in a Star Wars movie.   I remember my cinema gasping at certain scenes and applauding because it was genuinely beautiful.   \\n\\nSome of these fans (myself)\\, made so many ridiculous theories about certain characters and expectations about what would happen in this movie.  Half of us are responsible for our own disappointment.  There are still questions to be answered\\, but they have been left completely open ended for the next director to answer.   \\n\\nNo Star Wars movie is perfect\\, as was this movie.  But after stewing on it\\, I reckon I'd put this in at least my top 3.  It's a movie that wasn't made FOR the fans\\, it doesn't give us everything us oldies wanted.    Instead\\, it looks to conclude stories and character paths which open doors for new characters that futures generation will love and adore\\, just as we did with the OG cast.","true":true}
