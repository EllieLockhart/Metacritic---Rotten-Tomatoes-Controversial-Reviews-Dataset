Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So\\, there are apparently quite a few \\\"fans\\\" that did not like this movie.  I'm perplexed at this since it is quite easily the best Star Wars movie that I've seen in a theater (unfortunately\\, I was too young to get my mom to take me to see The Empire Strikes Back).  This movie is its own movie while still being very much a Star Wars film.  It does not follow the by the numbers plot that has developed since a galaxy far far away enamoured so many of us as children.  Although I enjoyed The Force Awakens\\, that film came close to imploding by simply being more of the same.  \\n\\nThe Last Jedi often takes the assumed plot points and then turns them on their heads.  It allows its characters to grow and (wait for it) breathe...  The acting and direction is fantastic\\, and the story develops in such a way that nothing feels like it is a given.  I appreciate that Rian Johnson directed a story that wasn't phoned in or was derivative but was still very much Star Wars.  \\n\\nFor those that wanted to see the same old Star Wars movie\\, there are 7 other choices to choose from.  For those that want to see the Star Wars epic expanded upon with unexpected twists and the best performances of the series\\, I highly recommend The Last Jedi.","true":true}
