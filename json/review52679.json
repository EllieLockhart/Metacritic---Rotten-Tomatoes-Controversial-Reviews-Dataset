Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All the cast seem to be siloed\\, the fun of star was camaraderie was simply non existent. The obvious decisions to purposefully not fulfil anything the fans wanted hopefully has backfired. I watched this movie twice\\, just because I could not believe what I was seeing. You want reasons and explanations\\, expect none.\\nWhen Mark Hamill fundamentally disagrees with the storyline for his character is portrayed\\, they should have listened.\\nRose should not have been there\\, Finn should have died a hero's death.\\nThis was not a movie of the failure of the resistance\\, it was the failure of how to make a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
