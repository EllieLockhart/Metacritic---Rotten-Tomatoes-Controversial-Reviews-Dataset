Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A complete disservice to the franchise. I don't know what critics are trying to pull\\, but this movie was garbage. A pinnacle of human garbage. \\nSome may argue that its just a movie and to take it at face value; that's fine. However\\, movies are supposed to entertain us and this installment does anything but. I really wanted to like TLJ\\, but I cannot. If I could rate any lower\\, I would. 0\/5.","true":true}
