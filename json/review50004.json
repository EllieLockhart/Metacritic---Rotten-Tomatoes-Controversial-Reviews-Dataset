Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You would expect after all that time growing white beard\\, Luke can throw baddies around using his telekinesis or force crush tie fighters.....verdict: nowhere near my expectation-disappointed! The Force Awakens and then the Force Dies of boredom...","true":true}
