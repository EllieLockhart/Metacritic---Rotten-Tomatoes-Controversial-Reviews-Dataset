Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never posted before\\, but I love Star Wars too much not to comment on this train wreck of a movie. There are too many individual problems to comment on them all and others have spoken eloquently. I will summarize by saying that this was the worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen. Rian Johnson clearly had no respect for JJ Abrams story or George Lucas' characters nor did he give a damn about what fans of the saga. Not to mention he was a terrible writer in his own right and the movie had glaring plot holes\\, cringe worthy humor and terrible pacing. I love both Disney and Star Wars in general. Not right now\\, epic fail Disney\\, truly epic fail.","true":true}
