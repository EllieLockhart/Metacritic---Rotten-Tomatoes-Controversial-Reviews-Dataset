Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Superior Star Wars!  I usually suffer through Star Wars in spite of bad acting because my kids like it.  Not this one!  Wow!  It stood all on its own as a great movie.  The directing was fantastic.  The characters were so improved in this movie.  We hated all of them from The Force Awakens but loved the exact same actors and characters in this movie. We talked about it for days after seeing it.  I really\\, really hope they bring this director back!","true":true}
