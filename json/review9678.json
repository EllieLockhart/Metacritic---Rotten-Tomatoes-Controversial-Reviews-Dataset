Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good movie\\, very solid addition to Star Wars Franchise. I personally could of done without gambling planet and Princess Leia flying in space movie is so laughable it reminds me of Jurassic park three talking dinosaurs. Other than than that loved it. 5 stars.","true":true}
