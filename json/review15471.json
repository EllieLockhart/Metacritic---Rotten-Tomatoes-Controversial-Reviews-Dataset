Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it! It not only gave us something new to look forward to\\, it also forced Abrams in a postition to keep going with the new stuff and not create another OT remake because idk about y'all but I saw elements of Empire Strikes Back and Return of The Jedi in this! I'm excited to see where Star Wars is going and it hurts me that so many people try to trash talk this film. It was great\\, and can not wait to see what else the galaxy far far away is going to bring me!","true":true}
