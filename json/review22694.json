Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like Rogue One\\, this is a Star Wars film that is willing to do something different. By avoiding some of the standard plot beats and using characters to drive the plot\\, the film creates a tension that I didn't think was possible for a Star Wars film. Even Rogue One was constrained by us knowing where it had to end up\\, and the Force Awakens held few surprises. So\\, the first Star Wars film since the original three with genuine surprises - the new trilogy may escape the shadow of its predeccesors (good and bad).","true":true}
