Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is very little to like in the movie.  The story has no regard for established canon or plotlines and seems very out of place as the middle part of a trilogy.  I wish they could reboot this episode with a director that knows how to make a Star Wars movie rather than just trying to subvert expectations with nonsense and bad writing.","true":true}
