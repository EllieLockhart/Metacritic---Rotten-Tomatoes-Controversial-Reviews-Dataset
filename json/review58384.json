Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After Rogue One this movie is such a letdown It is difficult to know where to begin. \\n1) The director should be banned from the movie business.  Seriously\\, I think this is the only movie I have ever seen where I thought the director was just a royal screw up.  \\n2) The movie is 45 minutes of plot stretched out to about 2 hours.\\n3) The casting is questionable.\\n4) Don't waste your money is the point.  Just go and watch Rogue One and live with the cliff hanger and maybe the Empire Strikes Back if you want to see a decent Star Wars movie.\\n\\nAs for the rotten tomatoes I will never again trust their ratings\\, just look at the disparity between the rue reviews and the profs.  How any person could give this movie a 4 or 5-star rating without being paid to lie or stoned out of their mind is just incomprehensible.","true":true}
