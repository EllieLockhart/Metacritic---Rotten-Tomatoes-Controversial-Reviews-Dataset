Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow Rian Johnson....as someone who saw the original trilogy in the theaters...what a new fresh take on this franchise....few nitpicks but in a few years people who criticize now will have it in top 3 ....it'll be a fine wine","true":true}
