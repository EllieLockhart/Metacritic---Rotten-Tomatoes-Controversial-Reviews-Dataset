Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a big Star Wars fan but this one I can't recommend. There's a lot of plot holes\\, cringy scenes and lots of missed opportunities.\\nThe Skywalker's saga must come to an end  so the new heroes can take the spot light\\, but they way they did it was very lame.","true":true}
