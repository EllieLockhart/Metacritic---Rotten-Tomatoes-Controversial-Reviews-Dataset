Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Last Jedi is a good movie but it is not a good Star Wars movie.   I have higher expectations for a Star war film - especially when Luke is in the movie.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi destroyed everything I loved about the Star Wars universe.   Other than the awesome opening scene with Poe\\, the plot was predictable. \\n\\nThere is not a single good light saber scene\\, weak new character developments\\, and most importantly\\, it completely destroyed the legacy of Luke Skywalker and what the Jedi order stands for.   It is very upsetting to see this most unjust fate for our childhood hero Luke Skywalker.   Luke who has never given up throughout the George Lucas's first three Star Wars\\, gave up easily in this film. \\n\\nI bought 16 tickets for the biggest movie of the year and many of us were mad walking out of the theatre.    I did not wait 30+ years to see this crappy ending of Luke Skywalker.   Please have a little respect and remove this firm from the Star Wars universe and give Luke a proper ending.","true":true}
