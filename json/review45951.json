Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually beautiful and exciting with great combat sequences.  Anyone involved in writing the script or directing should be taken to Jakku\\, have their memory wiped and handed over to a junk dealer.  Instead of one or two big plot twists\\, there were dozens cases of the director setting up one thing and then doing something else\\, leaving the audience frustrated.  A huge amount of time was devoted to sequences that didn't matter to the outcome\\, while major questions were ignored or brushed off in a way that disappointed.    All that we learned about Jedi in the previous 7 movies was thrown out the window by the renegade Disney writing team.  The Star Wars franchise was left in wreckage by this movie.","true":true}
