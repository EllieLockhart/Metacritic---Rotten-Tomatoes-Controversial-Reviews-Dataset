Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was good but not great. The humour was terrible and forced. The only character that could use humour is Poe Dameron because his character has been written like that. Domhall Gleeson's performance as General Hux was overly good\\, he had his ups and downs. I also didn't like how the movie primarily focused on setting up episode 9 and i didn't like how Benicio Del Toro was barely in the movie\\, in my opinion a waste of a character. Captain Phasma was underrated again. Now onto the good stuff. Mark Hamill's performance was spectacular\\, same with Carrie Fisher. It was a good last movie for her. The twists in it were really good as it makes you think something is going to happen but then it doesn't. Overall it was a good movie but it's not the best one. 8.7\/10","true":true}
