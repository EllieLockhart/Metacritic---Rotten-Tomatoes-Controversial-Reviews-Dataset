Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you want a family friendly film to watch with your family whilst munching on popcorn\\, this is the movie for you. If you wanted a true successor to the original trilogy its nowhere to be found. The Last jedi is filled to the brim with homages to empire strikes back and even follows the plotline. The action scenes were well done\\, cinematography was on point. But where the last jedi fumbles for me is how light-hearted everything felt\\, most audiences will get quite a few chuckles out of the wacky moments of this film\\, but those chuckles come at the expensive of the tone of the movie. The stakes are low for the heroes so low that at no point will you believe that they are in danger\\, because something wacky is bound to save the heroes in one way or the other. The last jedi also suffers from trying to introduce too many character plot-lines that have no real importance to the story. Overall the last jedi isnt a terrible film\\, its alright.","true":true}
