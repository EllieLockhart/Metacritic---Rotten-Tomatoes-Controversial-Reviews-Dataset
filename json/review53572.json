Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Extremely disappointed. Top billing\\, great budget\\, awesome visuals\\, rich lore\\, established characters and a loyal fan base to draw from. What could possibly go wrong?\\n\\nWriting is of such poor quality that it disrespects all of the hard work above. I went in without having read spoilers nor reviews; this movie started smelling funny with the gags and overdone comedy; decomposed as characters turned out to be cardboard cut-outs from anything but SW; and finished rotting by the time non-consequential side plots were wrapped up. I will always remember the best two moments as the only good ten seconds of an otherwise terrible 151 minutes.\\n\\nAs a standalone B movie it would merit 2 stars at most but as part of the Star Wars saga\\, one star would be too kind. I used to be a loyal fan since the first SW came out. No more. Count me out. I will only watch future installments if reviews are any good and I count on fans and audience to keep these honest.\\n\\ntl;dr: Bad fanfiction.\\n\\n\\\"I have a bad feeling about this.\\\" -Skywalker\\n\\\"As if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.
