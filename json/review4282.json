Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By no accounts is it a \\\"bad movie.\\\" It was just a very safe movie. Nothing had consequences\\, there were too many characters\\, and any interesting plot points that were setup in the movie were thrown away in the third act.\\nI really wanted to enjoy the movie\\, and kept looking for something to grab onto\\, but I could count the scenes I liked on one hand. The rest of the movie was fan service\\, circle jerking\\, and predictable.","true":true}
