I cried twice during the Last Of Us Part 1 - I admit it. it's story was that different - that unique - that powerful. And that's really where this game falls apart - is in its story telling. The one thing that made this IP epic\\, seven years ago....\r\rThe Last of Us Part 2 had me crying but only bemoaning the loss of what was once a testament to what story could be in a video game! The Last of Us gave us a model for what was possible through tightly written well paced drama. Instead its successor seems hellbent\\, determined to undo the first game in literal ways as well as metaphorical but I digress for spoiler reasons. It is so unfortunate to see my fellow gamers echoing and sympathizing with these sentiments on other open platforms and this game to still have received such a high score by critics - the truth is this game sits at a 6 or 7 and that would be for someone unfamiliar with the first game. But what is more unfortunate\\, if you play the first game after playing this - it won't make any damn sense.\r\rSomething is very wrong. We've forgotten how to write. GoT after Martin. The soap opera that became the Walking Dead. The endless amount of content is not necessary if you don't tell your story well. The creative forces behind Naughty Dog sound genuine and I don't want to be dismissive of their good intentions but... whatever the message\\, moral or meaning of this journey was - was just unnecessary\\, confusing and forgettable. Go read or watch \\\"The Road\\\" instead and please don't hide behind various movements to justify your bad story telling\\, your poor product. Distasteful all around and not in the way the developers intended.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
