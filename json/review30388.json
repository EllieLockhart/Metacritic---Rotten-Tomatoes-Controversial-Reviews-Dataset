Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Seen this twice now - once for the midnight release to avoid spoilers then took my daughter to see it over Christmas. What a complete shambles - no-one to route for\\, Luke's character and the Star Wars legacy have all but been destroyed in order to use the Star Wars brand as a tool to push political BS. All these so called 'feminists' championing so called inclusion really need to watch EP3 again to see a real kick ass woman in action courtesy of Carrie Fisher. This dross is just pay lip service to the mainstream narrative that is so prevalent in Hollywood. Even Mark Hamill slammed it before having to publicly back track and now it seems Disney are trying a 'say it often enough and people will believe it' routine to cover up the split response to this woeful movie.","true":true}
