Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The professional critics consensus rated Last Jedi 90% according to Rotten Tomatoes but the audience rated it 48%. This is unusual as the audience is usually more tolerant but I agree with the audience. This is bad. Not entirely bad\\, the last 15 minutes or so showed what the film could have been otherwise it is painting by numbers.","true":true}
