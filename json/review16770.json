Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In my opinion\\, this new epic chapter of our beloved saga reaches the level of The Empire Strikes Back. Enough easter eggs to get melancholic\\, a neat and unpredictable plot that kept me at the edge of my seat\\, and a fresh cut on the direction that makes it completely sui-generis. A must see for anyone\\, fan or not.","true":true}
