Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I HATED absolutely EVERYTHING about this movie. 0\/10\\n\\nThe structure\\, the plot\\, the poor attempt at Marvel style 'humour'\\, the desecration of beloved characters\\, the lack of character development\\, no pay off for anything that was set up previously.  Instead\\, it was a nihilistic\\, post modern piece of trash whose overarching message was \\\"let the past die\\\".  \\n\\nI have watched many TLJ reviews on youtube and so far I have come to the realisation  that the franchise is now a fans' ponzi scheme\\, promising answers to questions posed but always in the NEXT movie! Give up your money...buy porgs\\, crystal foxes\\, razors\\, bags of lettuce with Rey on the front. I'm so done with that. \\n\\nI have loved Star Wars my whole life\\, Empire is my favourite movie (not just of SW) of all time. \\n\\nTHIS movie was the ultimate betrayal\\, far worse than anything the Prequels ever did.\\n\\n I will not see Episode IX\\, the stupid Solo movie no one wanted and I will not buy a single Disney\/ Star Wars related product again. I will never\\, ever\\, forgive what has been done to Luke Skywalker so I shall do as this film advises\\, I will let the past die. RIP Star Wars 1977-1983.","true":true}
