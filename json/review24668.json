Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"movie was boring bad 90 % of ppl who died dont even know the name of its called star wars not chasing a ship for 2 fck hours and they totaly wasted mark hamil and snoke died so lame i mean cmon disney that casino scene wtf star wars is famous for usicng inventive gfx this movies horses looked worst than the cgi from the preq i hate this movie so hard and the fact that disney tries to force in every scene a woman in all there movies makes my so angry","true":true}
