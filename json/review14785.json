Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have seen this three times. It's bold and different. It takes all the expectations and theories and throws them off the cliff. Rian Johnson has a voice and a vision. Most of the scenes were great. A few made me tear up. There some scenes and characters that don't work but I think overall it is a good film and it will have fans thinking\\, arguing\\, and reflecting for a long time(or until Solo comes out in May). P.S. I am not a bot. I have been a Star Wars for about 33 years. Watch it and decide for yourself\\, at least twice. ","true":true}
