Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Commercialisation gone wild. Lack of direction\\, poorly timed comedy and a confusing and weak plot.\\n\\nNo wonder so few real cinema visitors (not the film critics who's job it is to promote themselves through the act of licking the backsides of Hollywood) can tolerate this Disneyfied piece of garbage. \\n\\nGo and change the direction of some other Hollywood franchise\\, Disney. Leave Star Wars to the real fans who don't require massive direction changes to be happy. Sometimes simpler is better.","true":true}
