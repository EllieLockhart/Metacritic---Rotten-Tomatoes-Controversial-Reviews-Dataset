Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian does a great disservice to Star Wars by creating black hole level plot holes\\, ruins characters\\, and builds a movie that offers zero progression. A grand failure for true fans and a disaster to the Expanded Universe. ","true":true}
