{"101487":128701,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How in the love of Judas Priest did professional film critics give this movie a 93% Fresh rating? Disney must have bought out those positive critic ratings. And yes\\, this review contains spoilers\\, because this movie must be spoiled. No\\, you should not waste two hours of your life on this slap in the face of a movie. Save your hard earned money and buy\/rent the original trilogy on Blu Ray instead. \\n\\nMy expectations admittedly going into this film were not high\\, thanks to the awful turd we got in 2015 that was The Force Awakens... or as I like to call it\\, \\\"Star Wars: A Newer Hope\\\" for being a total ripoff of the classic A New Hope. If you hated that film as I did\\, or if you're just an actual fan of what classic Star Wars accomplished\\, then you will be reviled by this movie. I wanted to give this movie a chance\\, but this movie makes TFA actually look good and even to a degree makes the prequels look good\\, that is how terrible this film is. Jar Jar is no longer the most embarrassing thing about the Star Wars universe\\, it is this movie\\, which is something I never thought I could ever utter in my life. \\n\\nIf you like flat and tone deaf\\, terrible off-putting humor worse than what we saw in TFA that mentally takes you out of the drama of a scene every time\\, or watching studio hacks butcher your childhood hero's character by having him be a spiteful jaded\\, murderous\\, get-off-my-lawn anti-Luke who drinks green gross alien cow milk almost straight from the teet after casually chucking Anakin's legendary blue lightsaber over his shoulder off a cliff without a second thought\\, love watching princess Leia survive being sucked into the vacuum of space after an explosion by using the force to superman her way through empty space without life support back to an exploded starship\\, enjoy seeing backstoryless but important characters introduced in the last film be casually and anticlimactically killed off making their existence mostly useless and pointless\\, and want to find out that despite Jar Jar Abrams and Rian Johnson building up Rey as a Mary Sue SuperSaiyan jedi Rey's big buildup of her parents just is a giant Rickroll circlejerk\\, and like seeing Yoda's force ghost gleefully and inexplicably light a tree on fire by summoning lightning from the sky\\, then you will love this movie. \\n\\nEmpire Strikes Back scenes and elements are ripped off and the colossal iconic AT-AT's from Empire are minimized for even bigger Gorilla (wtf?) walkers for some reason\\, Return of the Jedi's throne room scene is heavily ripped off\\, the story has about 10 different plot points that are poorly developed and a romance more poorly developed than Episode II\\, a main plot line about an ongoing chase of the Resistance by the First Order that has no suspense and will bore the hell out of you\\, and an obvious betrayal plotline a four year old could have seen coming. Oh and somehow now people can suddenly force-project their bodies and even other people's bodies to other parts of the galaxy\\, because lazy script requires it. We never get an explanation of how Maz got Luke's\/Anakin's blue lightsaber\\, we never see the Knights of Ren again or who the hell they are or how that all came to be\\, there are no epic Luke Skywalker lightsaber fight scenes with his green lightsaber\\, and what we do get in the story is poor development and lazy screenwriting. Rian Johnson cannot be a fan of the original films to have approved even half the garbage slap in the face nonsense of this movie we are subjected to in good faith. Wow. Disney never had any real direction or interest in doing this saga any justice. These movies are a wanton and shameless cash grab by Disney who knows dumb\\, fanbot sheeples with no critical thinking will keep giving Disney billions of dollars to produce more of this trope. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi? More like The Last Disney Star Wars Movie I Will Ever Subject Myself To Again. I will absolutely not be seeing Episode 9 or any Disney Star Wars film ever again. This is seriously probably the worst film I have ever seen in my life. For the love of jove do not give those greedy scum at Disney more money so they can produce more of this offputting trash. \\n\\nIf you loved the prequels and Episode 7 you will adore this movie. If you are a true fan who actually gives a damn about the masterpieces that are the original trilogy then you will absolutely abhor this movie.","true":true}
