Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie felt like it was made by chopping up and mixing together a good movie and a bad movie: parts were good\\, parts were terrible\\, none of it fit together well\\, and it was twice as long as it should have been.\\n\\nFirst\\, a couple of the good things:\\n\\nGood acting\\, despite a thin script. Ridley and Driver make the dynamic between their characters believable\\, while Hamill\\, Fisher\\, and Del Toro put in solid performances.\\n\\nSome beautiful visuals\\, especially at the remote island\\, in the throne room\\, and outside the abandoned base.\\n\\nAnd now a tiny sample of the bad:\\n\\nToo many forced jokes and glib one-liners. Yes they need a lift\\, you can see they're about to die.\\n\\nCharacters acting on the motives of the filmmakers\\, instead of their own. \\\"I want them to have hope\\, and they're asking if I have a plan to save their lives. The true answer is 'yes' ... I'll refuse to answer the question! That way we have have a dramatic confrontation\\, they think listening to me will kill them\\, and we get another chase scene during our chase scene.\\\"\\n\\nExcessive epic-ness. Too many explosions\\, too many last-second saves\\, too many last stands. Worse\\, characters are forced to deal with everything - loss\\, failure\\, redemption\\, hope\\, betrayal\\, and more - as epic themes\\, never on a purely personal level. When a character deals with those things differently than we would\\, it should feel like an insight into their character. Instead\\, it feels dumb because the character is just a mouthpiece for a filmmaker who's trying and failing to speak for us.\\n\\nThrough those and many other flaws\\, The Last Jedi shows it has no respect for the audience. Maybe critics don't notice because they also have no respect for the audience.","true":true}
