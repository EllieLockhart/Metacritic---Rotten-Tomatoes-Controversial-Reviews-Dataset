Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually one of the best star wars films in recent memory\\, the second installment of the third trilogy makes bold statements that it (largely) backs up. While a couple characters motivations seem to flip-flop a few too many times and the movie gets sidetracked while making a very much appreciated point about war\\, it's absolutely a must see for those who thought TFA played it too safe. Farewell\\, Jakku! You will not be missed!","true":true}
