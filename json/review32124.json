Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(spoilers) This movie was pretty good. I don't know why people hate it. Are they mad because Luke dies? It's not as good as The Force Awakens\\, but has some exciting moments. Luke's illusion at the end was epic\\, and the escape from Canto Bight was dope. Adam Driver is lame and awkward. The Asian girl is not as bad as everyone says. I think they got mad because she took Finn away from Rey. ","true":true}
