Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a horrible missed opportunity. Every interesting subplot was nipped in the bud miles from their potential. Seemed like the entire purpose of this movie was to mimic contemporary geopolitics and slap the franchise in the face\\, all while destroying any chance Episode IX will be anything but awful. Save your money.","true":true}
