Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Completely throws off the series\\, yet again\\, Star Wars has become a disjointed mess\\, and switching directors\\, yet again was a cowardly move born from a lazy production team. Instead of improving on the series they threw it out and started it again for no real reason. The whole movie felt like a middle finger to the audience. What petulant child creates a tone like that.","true":true}
