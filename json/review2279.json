Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A total slap in the face to fans..  horrible writing\\, editing and plot holes all over the place!  I had hope that Disney could do a good job with my favorite series..","true":true}
