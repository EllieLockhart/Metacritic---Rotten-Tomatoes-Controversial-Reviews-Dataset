Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How they made this film:\\nAdd a bunch of creatures and animals nobody cares about.\\nThrow away every storyline set up in Force Awakens.\\nRuin my childhood hero.\\nWell done Rian\\, you ruined my childhood hero.\\n\\nHelps us J.J.
