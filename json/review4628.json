Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Coming off from the lazy The Force Awakens I was hoping this would be different\\, with a bit more originality. What we have instead feels like a rushed job to be different. Marvels Guardians of the Galaxy seems like it ruined many movies for me. Everything has to have a certain amount of comedy and by now it feels forced. The characters are also annoying and many scenes were very pointless (casino arc). Luke Skywalker returns but his character is flawed. He's out of character in many scenes and Rey's training is rushed. The ending gets a bit too campy and many situations could've been avoided but was there to serve an underwhelming plot. This story is just poorly written. Its fun to watch most times\\, but I cringed far too often and rolled my eyes in many scenes for me to recommend this movie as a must watch. ","true":true}
