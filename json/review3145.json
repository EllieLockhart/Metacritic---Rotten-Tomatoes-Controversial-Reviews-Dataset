Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Based on this movie\\, I have made the definite decision not to pay to see another Star Wars movie ever again. I thought it was that bad. A complete mess\\, which strips the story of the OT of its entire point and purpose\\, disrespecting the characters from that story (including the memory of Carrie Fisher)\\, leaving only the iconography of that art served up cold as a bunch of marketing gimmicks\\, bad jokes and pointless characters. I hated it\\, and I'm so disappointed. Disney do not deserve our money for this mess.","true":true}
