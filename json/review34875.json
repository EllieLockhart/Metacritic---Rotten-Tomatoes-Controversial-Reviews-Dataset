Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The fanboys are dragging this movie down. It\u2019s a solid movie\\, and contained all the Star Wars elements we\u2019ve come to expect. It\u2019s certainly not flawless and there are parts of it that didn\u2019t do it for me. It entertained me and that\u2019s really all that is important when going to see a movie. I\u2019ll definitely see it again for a more objective take but on first viewing it didn\u2019t disappoint.","true":true}
