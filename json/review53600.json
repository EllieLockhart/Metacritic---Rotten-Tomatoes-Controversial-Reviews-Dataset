Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Felt kind of like one of those Superman movies: very long\\, numbing really. Just never clicked\\, no magic\\, boring subplots. Rey\\, thanks to that very good actress\\, feels real and sincere. Mark Hamill should've had something better to do with these last couple of Star Wars movies. Just a really long and difficult-to-follow mess that ultimately didn't bother to make you care. It'll make a ton of money but it sure wasn't any fun.","true":true}
