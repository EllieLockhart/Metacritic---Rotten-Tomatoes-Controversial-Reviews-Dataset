Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm surprised to see how divided people are on this movie. I'm a lifelong Star Wars fan and really enjoyed it. The more I watch it the more I enjoy it. I have a feeling that this movie will be reviewed more positively in the eyes of it audience as time goes by and people realize that the characters and plot went in a different direction to what they had imagined and that this was okay to happen.","true":true}
