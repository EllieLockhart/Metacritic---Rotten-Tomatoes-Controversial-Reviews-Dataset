Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I very much enjoyed this Star Wars movie. It was action-packed\\, funny and full of surprises!\\n\\nBELOW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!\\nAfter the Force Awakens\\, fans and media set-up questions such as\\, 'who are Rey's Parents?' and 'Where did Snoke come from?' - as these answers are not delivered as expected\\, some fans struggle to feel satisfied and also revert to making comparisons to the film's predecessors. \\n\\nI personally loved how it went against the status quo. Before the prequels\\, we never knew anything about the Emperor\\, and it was the mystery that made this character more compelling. After Revenge of the Sith\\, that enigma was explained and therefore ruined. Rian Johnson has ended this film with the focus purely on Rey and Kylo - the only two characters (for me) that really matter. We don't need another moustache twirling overlord (Snoke) - this has already been done. What we haven't seen is a villain like Kylo that suffers from a conflict of emotion\\, and making dangerous decisions based on impulse (Vader was aware of his choices). The fact Kylo kills the head cheese (out the blue!) means anything is possible from this irrational wreck. \\n\\nThis film isn't without some minor faults (but the originals are no exception). If you watch this film without making comparisons and expectations\\, and allow it to take you on the journey that it intends\\, you will certainly have fun! If you are expecting to experience the same plot points as the originals\\, then you have an unsatisfying experience.\\n\\n\\\"Learn to let go of everything you fear to loose\\\" - Yoda (the crappy prequels)","true":true}
