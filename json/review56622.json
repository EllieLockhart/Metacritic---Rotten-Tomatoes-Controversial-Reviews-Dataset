Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is the latest in Star Wars movies that is at war with its own past and mythos. The film's main problems is the bland characters that have no depth and this problem is compounded by the plot which does not allow any type of characterization to occur. No character suffers more from this than Rey. Where as with Luke Skywalker you could plot a journey with legitimate setbacks\\, heart breaks and triumphs there is no such thing with Rey either in the past movie \\\"Force Awakens\\\" and now in the Last Jedi as well. The rest of the characters suffer from this as well and I can't go into more details without getting into spoilers. The film also seems adamant to discard the themes and mythos of the original trilogy. \\\"Let the past die. Kill it if you must\\\" says Kylo Ren at one point. If you felt that the characters established in Force Awakens such as Rey\\, Kylo Ren and Snoke would get satisfying back stories and reveals as to who they really are\\, prepare to be disappointed. \\n\\nAll in all\\, this is a movie at war with its own identity and it is not for the better. The film looks and sounds great but the plot and characterization holds it back.","true":true}
