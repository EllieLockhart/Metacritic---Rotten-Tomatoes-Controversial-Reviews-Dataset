Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you have never seen any of the other Star Wars movies\\, The Last Jedi is a fine movie. It is reasonably entertaining and not bad to go see with some friends on a friday night. BUT if you have seen any of the other movies\\, The Last Jedi is just bad. It does not follow the themes\\, character development or feel of any of the other movies. This movie might as well be a Marvel movie with the cheeky dialogue\\, over the top action\\, and half hearted attempts at romance.","true":true}
