Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually pretty\\, but the story only works in a silo\\, ignoring episode 7... and even then it is pretty weak. Any buildup on characters in the Force Awakens have been totally abandoned\\, and all plotlines are mostly left for new ones.Only Rey appears to be a star in both episodes\\, and even her story takes an unnecessary twist. Looks like movie directors forgot that a good twist has its own subtle buildup that you sneak past the audience because of red herrings... not just randomly tacked onto the butt of a pinata.","true":true}
