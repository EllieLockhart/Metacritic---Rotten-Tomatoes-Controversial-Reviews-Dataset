Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really bad \\\"Star Wars\\\" movie.  On a par with Episodes 1-3 (released 4th\\, 5th\\, and 6th in the Series)\\, but for different reasons.  In \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" the actors and characters are all OK (mostly)\\, but this time it is the overly-long and surprisingly boring plot that hurts.  It makes the inevitable silly stuff (present in all movies of this kind) stand out all the more.  What makes it worse is that there was SO much potential--some really beautiful cinematography and special effects\\, and some interesting plot angles.  But there needed to be someone at Director Johnson's shoulder whispering in his ear\\, \\\"Less is more\\, Rian; less is more.  Leave something for the next film.\\\"\\n\\nDon't get me wrong\\, this is not \\\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\\\" bad.  But after the excellence (based on successfully capturing the ESSENCE of the very first film) of J.J. Abram's \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" this is a real disappointment.  Hopefully Abrams can put the series back on track with Episode 9.","true":true}
