Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'll keep this brief... whoever wrote this mess of a movie should be given a tour of the pit of misery\\, DILLY DILLY! I mean it's seriously terrible! Even the action doesn't save it. As a true Star Wars fan\\, I'm utterly disappointed. ","true":true}
