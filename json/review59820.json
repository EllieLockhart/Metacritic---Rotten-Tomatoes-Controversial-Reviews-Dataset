The game is beautiful. The graphics and world building is captivating.\rThe AI is exhilarating\\, by using different weapons and tactics when confronted by your enemies.\r\rWhat I didn't like:\r\rThere are big problems with the story\\, the way it's told\\, and the way it was delivered.\rI get that it was experimental and similar to the styling of some directors\\, but it really didn't work for me.\rIt's a simple revenge story and it's Vanilla at best.\rThe game constantly forces you to like characters you have no relationship with. Introducing and killing them off almost feels like they didn't need to be there at all.\rI reckon Ellie's descent into chaos would have worked much better if they had kept Joel around for more than the 5 minutes of gameplay you get with him.\r\rAnyways\\, the game got about half of it right and the other half is an absolute mess.\r\rThis is not TLOU\\, this is a hot mess and time wasted I will never get back. The biggest disappointment in gaming for me since No Man's Sky.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
