Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ideas for a great Star Wars Movie: 1) Let Leia fly through space. 2) Lets make a chase of space ships in slow motion 3) Let the hero die of exhaustion. What a boring piece of cinema.","true":true}
