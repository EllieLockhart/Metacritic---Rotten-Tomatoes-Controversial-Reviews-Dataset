Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I started an account just to leave this review. The movie looks good in certain scenes\\, and the actors did well considering what they were given to work with. Rian Johnson doesn't like Star Wars. He used it as a platform to show us all how inclusive he is. Well done\\, Sir. We see you are inclusive. But Star Wars was already inclusive. We were hoping you'd give us a story about those characters we met in the last movie. We were hoping you'd give us a dignified ending to Luke Skywalker\\, whom I and many like me have looked up to since childhood\\, rather than making him a would-be murderer ego maniac following RotJ. We were hoping we would have our curiosity about the mysteries of the force piqued. Alas\\, none of those hopes are met. \\n\\nThis movie is a waste of so much potential. Not just for the new series of Star Wars movies but for the old ones. I'm not excited for Episode 9 because it can't be salvaged. This is coming from a person who really enjoyed TFA and Rogue One. I'm a lifelong fan of the series and I feel like I've had all hope taken away. The prequels were at times so bad it was unbelievable\\, but at least we could look forward to newer better Star Wars right? Perhaps the Han Solo movie or perhaps the Ben Kenobi movie\\, but not Episode 9. And if this clown Rian Johnson gets his own trilogy I will not be spending my hard earned pennies at the movies seeing it.","true":true}
