Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Having in mind that The Force Awakens was such an unoriginal movie The Last Jedi is a proof that there's still creative potential in Star Wars. Hats off to Rian Johnson who managed to clean up the mess JJ Abrams left behind. Star Wars is all about rhymes and themes repeating themselves. It can be done with very little imagination and creativity as in EP VII or it can be done the smart way as in EP VIII. Not that it's perfect. Finn's plot turns out to be unnecessary and there's too much confusion with Admiral Holdo for sure. The musical score is also the least standing out compared to the rest of the SW movies. Overall it was a lot of fun watching this movie.","true":true}
