Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dead average\\, still dont feel connected to any of the new characters and thought the overall story did nothing emotional. Also way to many cute animals\\, like really there was a cute animal in each setting. Disney getting ready to push toys i guess.","true":true}
