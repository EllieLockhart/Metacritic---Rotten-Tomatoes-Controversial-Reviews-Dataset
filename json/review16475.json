Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019m surprised at the poor audience reviews. This is a very solid episode. It is a bit long in parts\\, but the end of the movie pays off. I speculate that expectations are the enemy of this film. It\u2019s not the best ever\\, it\u2019s not the worst ever. Overall it\u2019s a good Star Wars movie that moved the franchise forward.
