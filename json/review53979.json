Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am Star Wars fan of old (Han shot first!!) Big disappointment! Huge Plot holes\/crappy plot bookends\\, Intergalactic force texting??\\, many campy moments with a large helping of politics\/feminism. No need for Jedi training any longer all force skills come preloaded??!?? This was a beautiful visual experience but throws a away a lot of Jedi History. This movie goes full on battle with Episode 1 & 2 to be the second worst Star Wars ever! Disney + Star Wars= politics and lack of plot depth! As a female perspective I never seen Star Wars make such a blatant effort to make every male character look so inept\\, childish\\, and powerless or just evil. My husband has seen every premier since ESB and said \\\"Its like Disney found Lawrence Kasdan's evil twin to make this movie!!\\\" The force is weak with this one :(!","true":true}
