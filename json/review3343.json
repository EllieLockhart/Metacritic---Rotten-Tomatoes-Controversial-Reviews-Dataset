Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Being original \/ unexpected does not equal good and that is true here. There were fun\/interesting things in the film but the fact that it leaves such a bad taste in the mouth of so many is indicative of a real problem ( one that is not the same as the post Empire feelings: those stemming from the film not having a happy ending). It's like Dorian Gray: a beautiful person with a rotten core. It is also a clever deconstruction of the spirit of the original. It does not look to complement or compliment the preceding movies (even the Force Awakens) but rather wants to tear everything down. As Luke tosses the light saber over his shoulder so goes myth and wonder that made the original timeless and magical. That was unexpected but not welcome. This wisdom of yore was burned. This movie left me with no further interest in the series.","true":true}
