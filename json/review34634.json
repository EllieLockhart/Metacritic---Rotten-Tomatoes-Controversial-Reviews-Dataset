Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The characters didn't feel like what they were set up to be. I feel like they missed an opportunity to do something amazing and maybe they just didn't know what direction to take and they shot in all directions and executed it poorly. Sure there were good moments\\, but I was disappointed.","true":true}
