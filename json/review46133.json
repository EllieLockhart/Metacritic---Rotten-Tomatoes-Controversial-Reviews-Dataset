Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"[+] Visuals\\n[+] Space Battle Intro\\n[+] Rey's nothing background\\n\\n[-] Awful Story Line\\n[-] Stupid Unneeded Casino Planet\\n[-] Poor plot devices\\n[-] Awful Jokes\\n[-] Unlikable characters\\n[-] Rey is still a master class prodigy for no reason\\n[-] Rey is supposed to be the main character but she is aimless\\n[-] Wasted original cast\\n[-] Wasted Snoke\\n[-] Wasted General Hux","true":true}
