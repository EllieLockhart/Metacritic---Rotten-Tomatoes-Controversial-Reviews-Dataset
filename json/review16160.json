Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm giving it one star for the special effects. Not even the music can save this piece of garbage. We've heard it 8 times already. Complete disrespect to fans of the franchise and one of the worst attempts at \\\"filmmaking\\\" in history. Never have we seen someone try not only to destroy plot points from the previous movie in a trilogy but also do his best to make it as hard as possible for the next movie to follow up. An objectively bad movie both from the standpoint of fan service and entertainment. China appropriately phrased it as \\\"insulting to their intelligence\\\". Disney should focus on quality management instead of calling those who dislike the movie \\\"sexists\\\".","true":true}
