Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like others state. Major plotholes\\, unrealistic\/useless (yes even in scifi) scenes\/\\,  and forced characters killed this movie. Yea they have nice effects and AAA production it's star wars and Disney. Yet huge fail on writing. \\nThere can be arguments for some of decisions why but in the end was it good? No...\\nPoe forced to be a tool. Ackbar dead a fan favorite with backstory. They constantly take a big load on fans who loved the EU and want a good villain. We don't need the word hope shoved down our throats for they don't even know what that means. Rogue one was. Great story with great chracters in comparison.\\nCasino scene total waste of space. Rose a forced induction that could of been more behind the scenes in favor of more character growth from others. Why? Cause it doesn't fit and we already have interesting characters to worknwith that need more time such as Finn and plasma\\, poe etc. \\n\\nThey want magic to happen yet fall short in many instances to making a point that makes sense to viewers.\\n\\nDisney playing with fire letting things like battlefront 2 with EA get out of hand and now this. What this means for the future of star wars needs to change","true":true}
