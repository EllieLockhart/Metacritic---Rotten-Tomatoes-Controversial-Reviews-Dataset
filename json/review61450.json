It is compelling in its own unique way\\, in DIRECT contrast to the first game. To continue the story of our beloved duo after the end of the first game was a joy and a dream for I and im sure millions of other fans. But because of this same love\\, I can see why many people argue the sequel disrespects Joel and Ellie. I just think Naughty Dog continued the story in the most realistic and likely way\\, rather than the way fans were praying and wishing to see. Its a brutal story of revenge. Just because it doesn't follow your prenotion of what a story should be doesn't make it \\\"awful story-telling\\\" and even worse \\\"ruins the whole game\\\". Another thing that pisses me off is when people say there are plot holes\\, but then fail to mention said plot holes. Maybe i am wrong\\, but I don't think there are any serious or major plot holes. That's my 2 cents\\, hopefully I don't get ddosed or death threats but you know how it goes.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
