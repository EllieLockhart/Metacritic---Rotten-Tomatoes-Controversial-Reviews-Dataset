Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Disney marketing machine ruined star wars by CREATING mystery of Rey's past and Snoke's origin only to dismiss it as irrelevant. The forced love story was bad too. I HATED the casino scene. I can tell Disney marketing team thought FORCING transgender\\, multicultural themes in this movie would sell more tickets. I wish they added a diverse cast without shoving it down our throats. The only GOOD scene was the \\\"hyperspace kill\\\". Other than that.......WHY did they do Luke that way. Luke would NEVER do something like that to Kylo.","true":true}
