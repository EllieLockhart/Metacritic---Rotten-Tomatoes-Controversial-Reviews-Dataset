We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I have been playing video games for almost 20 years and this is now my favorite game of all time. The game looks absolutely amazing\\, the art style is gorgeous\\, the face expression is the best I have ever experienced in a game\\, the level of details is astonishing\\, gameplay is simple but polished and very enjoyable\\, whether you like stealth\\, gun fights or exploration\\, I usually get tired of games halfway through but not with this game. The story is a roller coaster of emotions from beginning to end\\, and is very well directed. It is darker\\, more mature and more realistic. I liked most of the characters even Abby and her crew. What people need to realize is that every person in the game has a back story that motivates his actions\\, and people that he cares about and wants to protect. We all played the first TLOU and grew to love Ellie and Joel\\, but the reality is that Joel by saving Ellie\\, made a slaughter house of fireflies in the hospital and doomed all humanity in the act (even Ellie was angry about it)\\, so him having enemies that wants his head is natural and chances for it to actually happen was always high. Maybe his death could have been a little smoother I don't know. But hating the game just because of Joel dies is unjustified\\, It's like hating Game of Thrones just because Ned Stark dies. In brief\\, this game is a masterpiece and the best game I have ever played.\rIt saddens me how much free hate it is getting. The game got out the 19th of June I woke up in the next morning 10 hours after the release and there were already more than 10000 negative reviews (mostly zeros) complaining about everything even the ending!!! how is that even possible??? Imagine being like an art designer or something for the game working so hard for all these years creating this magnificent world and be rewarded with thousands of \\\"0\/10 this game is f****** garbage\\\" by people who didn't even play the game. At least if you don't like the story (which is a subjective matter) give some credit to the undeniably good thing. No one can deny that the game looks amazing. No one can deny that the gameplay is great. No one can deny how good the game sounds. No one can deny that the cinematics are astounding. No one can deny that the facial expressions are astonishing... So please people don't hoop in the hate train without thinking for yourself.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
