Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely stunning work of cinematography from Rian Johnson. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time\\, and kept me guessing what would happen next in the best way possible. Adam Driver\\, Daisy Ridley\\, Mark Hamill\\, and Carrie Fisher's performances were absolutely stunning. This is currently tied with ESB as my favorite entry in the saga. Amazing film.","true":true}
