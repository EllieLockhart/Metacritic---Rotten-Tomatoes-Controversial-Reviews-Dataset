Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force Awakens was a hollow death for the series. The Last Jedi was like watching the corpse of Star Wars being desecrated afterwards. I have never seen such disrespect or lack of understanding of source material like this except in the most terrible of fan fiction...which is really all the Disney backed Star Wars films are. Thank you Disney and all involved for taking a wonderful universe and molding it into a spiteful imposter of the galaxy far far away. The dialogue is ripped right out of a Marvel movie with almost every confrontation laced with snarkiness and quips. I only can recommend people view this to see how absolutely absurd and moronic almost every plot line is. \\nDisney Wars is not and never will be Star Wars.","true":true}
