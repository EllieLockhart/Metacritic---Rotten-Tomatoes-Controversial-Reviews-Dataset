Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"last star wars movie i will ever see thank you george lucas for so many good films\\,this one buried what little force remains\\,i have lost hope in disney for yet another reason i will avoid future projects they purchased but didnt understand \\,the movie was visually good and weak on many levels especially last of original characters being traded for ones i have no interest or desire to learn about\\, disappointed the 40 years are over\\,at least i can still watch star trek ","true":true}
