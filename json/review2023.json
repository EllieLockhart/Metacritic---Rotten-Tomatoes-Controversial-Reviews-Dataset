Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As someone who has grown up on Star Wars\\, watching Rian Johnson and Lucasfilm tear down my childhood and essentially tell me that nothing that I loved about the story matters is disheartening. The only good thing that I can say about this film is that it made me interested in reading the books.","true":true}
