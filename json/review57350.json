Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is very SJW thinking. It does not care about the rules that have been set up in the Star Wars Universe. Rian Johnson's imagination is fine\\, but he does not respect Star Wars. The action sequences are fine but have many mistakes in them. ","true":true}
