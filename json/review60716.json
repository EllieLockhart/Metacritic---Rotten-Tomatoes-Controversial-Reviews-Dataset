Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I loved the hell out of this game and yeah i know people that read this review are probably gonna disagree but i liked the story\\, the death of Joel what surprisingly early in the game but it sets the entire revenge plot\\, the only thing i didn't like is that ND false advertised the story by putting Joel in scenes or make Ellie older in scenes then the published version does but putting that aside i loved it that much that i took some time to platinum it and managed to do so\\, Abbeys part was sometimes boring but i does make you feel for the character that did murder the series most loved character but as you'll  find out it was with a reason behind it. I will end this review by saying that i can understand peoples hatred towards the game i can understand some aspects about this game could be misleading for those who really loved the first game. But i loved it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
