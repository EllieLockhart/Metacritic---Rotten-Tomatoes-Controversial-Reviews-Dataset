Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst film I've seen... And for all the ones that say that is great \\, definitively they need to see the precuels before. With time they will change their mind. Owful scenes\\, owful developement of characters\\, owful villains\\, owful heroes\\, owful decisions with the script...
