Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To all those people giving this movie a 4-5 star rating. You're not a TRUE Star Wars fan\\, you're a CASUAL movie goer. I love how they aren't saying why they like it\\, just the typical \\\"Best Star Wars movie sh*t\\\" do you really believe this comes close to the Originals? Or even the Prequels for that matter? Because this movie isn't even close to both of those. It's the TRUE Star Wars fans that are giving this low ratings because we actually care about Star Wars and don't want to see this franchise get ruined (well\\, it's already starting to because of this movie) The Critics are being bought off by Disney so don't listen to them. It's already been stated that Bots have nothing to do with the low ratings\\, do yourself a quick research and you'll see.","true":true}
