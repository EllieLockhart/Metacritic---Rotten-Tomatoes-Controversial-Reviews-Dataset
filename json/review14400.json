Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had hopes that Disney took a step forward but tragically this was a lot worse than I could\u2019ve imagined. Cheesy humor\\, horrible and I mean horrible directing.. weird pacing.. obvious rehashing of OT in parts. Disney spend some time really paying attention to EP 5 and 6 when they took it more seriously. Enough trying to make it a Disney story.. so disappointing ","true":true}
