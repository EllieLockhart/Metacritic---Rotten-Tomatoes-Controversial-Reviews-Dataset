Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An amazing addition to the franchise. Bolstered by some of the best cinematography to grace the series\\, The Last Jedi manages the incredible juggling act of balancing light homage to the original trilogy while deconstructing and rebuilding the themes that made it so memorable in the first place. Delivering outstanding set pieces and shots full of wonder and breathtaking contrast\\, Rian Johnson becomes the first director since Irvin Kershner to breathe a truly unique vision into George Lucas' sprawling universe. While it has its faults\\, the promise it paints for the future of the franchise is potent and full of hope.","true":true}
