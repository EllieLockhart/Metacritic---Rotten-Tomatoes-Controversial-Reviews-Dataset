Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fun and exciting film to add to the franchise\\, it's few flaws are forgivable\\, as the excellent character development drives the storyline. Many (many) laughs\\, ridiculously cool special effects\\, memorable fight scenes\\, and some new concepts introduced. Great throwback puppeteering of new and old characters\\, but blends easily with CG characters. This film shows the very human side of many characters\\, their flaws exposed\\, and raw emotion at times takes over\\, muddling reason. Overall\\, I can't wait to watch it again and catch all the details.","true":true}
