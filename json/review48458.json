Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Without spoilers\\, Star Wars The Last Jedi\\, is a fine movie\\, worth watching. That said\\, it is a very poor Star Wars movie and easily the worst of the 9 released to date (not counting the holiday special). The movie is a treat for the eyes\\, and has some solid acting (from some\\, not all) and decent twists (for better or worse)\\, but overall suffers from very poor writing and the lack of direction between directors and the story team is more obvious in a glaring way than either of the other two trilogies. This movie makes me vary uncomfortable about the fact that Last Jedi director\\, Rian Johnson\\, will head up an entirely new Star Wars trilogy. Again\\, my issues with the movie aside\\, I recommend watching it\\, but if you want to see a really good Rian Johnson film\\, go watch Brick instead.","true":true}
