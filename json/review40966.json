Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie does not deserve the hate it receives. While the cantobite scene was a little out of place\\, the rest of the movie was fresh and unpredictable. This movie offers a fresh alternative to the toxic and overwhelming family romance themes of living up to your parents legacy and finding your 'inner power'. Instead it offers valuable ideas\\, such as the idea that greatness can come from anywhere\\, an idea that is important in our society as we see an increase in divorce rates and broken homes. Unfortunately\\, the rise of skywalker  undoes everything this film did well and offers a dismal end to the skywalker saga.","true":true}
