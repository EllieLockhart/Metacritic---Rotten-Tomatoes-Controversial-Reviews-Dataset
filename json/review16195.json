Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm highly suspicious of the Audience Score after having seen TLJ. I loathed the JJ Abrams FA which was boring fan service at best. I walked into TLJ expecting more of the same but left happier than I've been since walking out of ROTJ as a kid. I've seen every SW movie in the theater and plan to see TLJ again this weekend. It's not a perfect movie\\, by any stretch\\, and some of the film should have been edited out\\, but overall\\, it's amazing.","true":true}
