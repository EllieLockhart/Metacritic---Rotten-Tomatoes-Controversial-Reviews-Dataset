This game is my biggest disappointment.\rThe game is disgusting in its plot.\rHow could you spoil the history of the first part?\rYou just took and mixed my favorite characters with dirt. In this story\\, Ellie is a maniac with a split personality. Joel is an antihero guilty of all the misery of the world.\rAbby .. From Abby you made the perfect all-forgiving character who is forced to empathize by squeezing a tear from the player.\rSide characters are faceless and have no open story. However\\, like all the surroundings in this game.\rWhy didn\u2019t you open the gang war? Why didn\u2019t you reveal the relationship between Abby and Owen? Why didn\u2019t you reveal your relationship with Dina?\rAll that is in this game is an incredibly beautiful picture and a bunch of questions about what is happening.\rYou say that the players did not understand the idea? No\\, this bad plot could not convey any idea. You wanted to show the story from different angles\\, but it didn\u2019t work out. The second part of the game is long and not interesting. The gameplay moments remained the same and simply do not work as part of the passage for Abby and the turns in the story are very predictable.\rBut the saddest thing is the end .. It would be better if you let Ellie finish the job. The plot would come to a logical conclusion.\rBut you ruined that too.\rSo\\, all that this game has left is frustration\\, resentment and emptiness.\rOf course I do not regret the money spent because this is the most beautiful game I have seen. Animations\\, graphics are all great. But this is not enough. First of all\\, I was waiting for a great plot\\, but I got nothing.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
