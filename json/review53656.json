Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Force Awakens played it safe and people complained and now RIan Johnson wasn't afraid to take the Saga to some unexpected twists and people complain. Great movie one of the best in the saga.","true":true}
