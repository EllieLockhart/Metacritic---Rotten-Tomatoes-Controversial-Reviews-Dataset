Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a pretty good star wars movie. the only thing i did not like about it was how Luke was handled\\, but i understand that this movie is about the new cast more than the old as is the prequels are about those characters.","true":true}
