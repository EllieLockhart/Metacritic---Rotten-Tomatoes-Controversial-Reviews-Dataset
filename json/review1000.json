Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Another cash grab from mega corporation\\, Disney\\, The Last Jedi sets fire to the Star Wars franchise and pisses on the ashes. A blatant \\\"F&*# You!\\\" to fans of the original trilogy from Lucas CEO Kathleen Kennedy\\, the film goes out of it's way to insult the audience with hackneyed plot devices and stale tropes. Earning it's PG-13 rating\\, this film contains a scene of an exposed alien teat being milked among other ghastly visions\\, so keep the kids at home! Final score: 1\/2 Star\\, Don't pay to see this movie","true":true}
