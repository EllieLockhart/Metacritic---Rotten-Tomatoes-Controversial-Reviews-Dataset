Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As the middle\/developmental movie in a trilogy arc\\, this film did a great job extending the storyline of Force Awakens\\, but leaving us wanting more for Episode IX. As a die-hard Star Wars fan\\, this did a great job balancing the needs of the original source material while also advancing the new characters and story lines.","true":true}
