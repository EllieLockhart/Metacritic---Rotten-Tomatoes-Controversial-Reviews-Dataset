Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have always been a fan of Last Jedi\\, but as I watch it again it continues to amaze me. If you want a Star Wars film that is just battles and fire fights then maybe this isn't for you\\, but if you really want to dive into Star Wars and ask yourself bigger questions then yes it is. Questions on the makings of a hero\\, redemption\\, the cost of war\\, how the actions of the Jedi and Skywalkers affect the rest of the galaxy. We learn that the Star Wars galaxy is so much larger than we once thought. That even Jedi have moments of lapsed judgement. That those lapses have consequences and that a true hero although the moral journey is bumpy always does the right thing. Last Jedi is the story of failure\\, we all have experienced it and to think these characters have not is be blind to the worlds truths. Ignore the internet trolls and see this film. Then think of how far Star Wars can expand now that its been made.","true":true}
