Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The death of star wars fan\\nSorry to star with this words\\, but Disney thought that this was a pixar movie... I just saw the movie... it couldn't be worse\\, how can this company specialized in story telling get so many things so wrong:\\n1) Luke throwing the laser was the first blow... this is not luke\\, this is not what luke is all about. He represents a generation\\, that simply is not what was shown.\\n2)  Eliminating the mask... the dark side.. the mask in everyone of us all... simply ridiculous. Lack of obscureness and respect for the dark side.\\n3) So many dumb jokes\\, at the worst moments\\, in the theater only two person laugh.\\n4) Rey's training\\,  missed it. This decision was made by someone that doesn't develop a character\\, that doesn't matures it.... very bad film director\\n5) Lukes death...Not the moment... not the occasion\\, bad timming.Every one has a reason for its existence\\, if lukes character was reserved for this... please... you should have killed him in the 3rd movie.\\n6)Yoda\\, you could have done better  \\nThis was a lack of respect for the fans\\, for the story\\, to many characters... but so little in depth. George Lukes must be having nightmares... or be happy that the Phantom menace isn't the worst episode.\\nThat's it\\, Camilo T","true":true}
