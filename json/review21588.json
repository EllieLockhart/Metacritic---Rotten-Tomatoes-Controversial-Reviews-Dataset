Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"JJ gave us false hope. It set up what could've been a good trilogy.\\nRian Johnson made sure that will never happen now. He fouled it up so badly\\, there can be no coming back for Star Wars from this now. The setback is too huge. Even episode 9 cuts all the political garbage and cuts Rose out\\, its still over. It'll be too little\\, too late.\\nBoycott the baastadds!","true":true}
