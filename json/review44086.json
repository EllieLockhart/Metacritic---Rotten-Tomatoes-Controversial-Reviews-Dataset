Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ ruined Star Wars for me. I hated everything about this movie. I in no way felt like the Original Trilogy. These characters are not one fifth as charismatic and interesting as the originals. The plot is lousy. It had virtually no redeemable qualities. I wish we could undo it. Boo.","true":true}
