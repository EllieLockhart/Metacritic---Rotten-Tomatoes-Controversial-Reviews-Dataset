Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie is an objectively bad movie. This is the result of a story with so much plotholes that it would make a good imatation for swiss cheese. Comedy that breaks the seriousness of every important character moment- A movie that doesn t respects continuity with the rest of the saga or even itself. Also we can note poor editing\\, useless characters and moments that break the universe rules. That rounded by a mary sue of a character has only three saving graces.  the relation between kylo and rey\\, the awesome visuals and the porgs.......fucking porgs.","true":true}
