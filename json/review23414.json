Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it! While I enjoy the Original Trilogy\\, and even the Prequels for what they are\\, I'm not as nostalgic as a lot of my parent's generation are for the older style. I really love the direction and characters' development in this installment. Great job Rian and the rest of Lucasfilm!","true":true}
