Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson nearly ruins the Star Wars franchise with what will easily be remembered as the WORST Stat Wars movie of all-time. Flying Leia? This movie is a bigger joke than the plot twist of Luke Skywalker being a dead beat on a deserted planet.","true":true}
