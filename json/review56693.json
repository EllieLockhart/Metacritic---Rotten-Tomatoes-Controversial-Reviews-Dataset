Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"The main reason why I fell in love with Star Wars was because of The Force Awakens\\, since then I've been looking forward to this movie. And after watching The Last Jedi I left the theatre SO DISAPPOINTED\\, not because of the plot nor the lack of likeness with the comics\\, but for five reasons: a) The lovely characters from the original trilogy don't have a strong importance in this movie\\, also the appearances are VERY LOW \/\/\/ b) The movie comes with less action sequences and offers more mythology and information of Rey's past and Jedi stuff\\, which is not bad but if director Rian Johnson dedicates 1\/3 time of the runtime to them it brings boredom (even the lightsaber duels were BULLSHIT) \/\/\/ c) Basically it was expected that this movie could answer so many doubts that episode VII left behind. Sadly\\, few of them were answered and it brought many more of them \/\/\/ d) So many characters were added and some of them died stupidly!!! (not spoilers this time) \/\/\/ e) A TERRIBLE SENSE OF HUMOUR\\, not only from the cast but from droids too\\, this includes a bad performance from most of the cast (Poe Dameron\\, Finn\\, Rose and more...)\\n\\nThat doesn't mean the movie was the worst Star Wars movie to date\\, it was still a decent Star Wars experience because of the incredible visual effects\\, and RIP Carrie Fisher. Also the animals added to the franchise were adorable a 100%!!! It's just that it could offer WAY MORE than it promised...\\\" So disappointed... (58%)","true":true}
