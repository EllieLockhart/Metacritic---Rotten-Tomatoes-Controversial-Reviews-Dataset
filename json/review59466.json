Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"At first I was trying to not get on the hate bandwagon for the game\\, and at a point in my playthrough I\u2019d have given it a higher score. But after finishing the game\\, a few things could\u2019ve been done better. Namely\\, how Abby\u2019s group got ahold of Joel\\, and the structure of the game. I think they could\u2019ve made him getting captured much more believable\\, even if it\u2019s just snippets throughout the games flashbacks showing how he\u2019s gotten kinder to strangers\\, and is quicker to trust them after being sheltered in a community for four years. He was essentially living the high life (or at least the kind you could live in a post-apocalyptic world)\\, and they could\u2019ve highlighted that in certain scenes of the game a lot better.The other thing would be to structure the game better\\, and to make it so you aren\u2019t just hopping around a three day time period and then going in to a flashback during the flashback when you play as Abby. Aside from those major gripes\\, the games actually very good\\, story and gameplay-wise\\, and I don\u2019t know what people are so irrationally angry about.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
