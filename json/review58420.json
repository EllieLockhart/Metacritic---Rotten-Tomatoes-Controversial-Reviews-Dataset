Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Aggressively slow\\, and painful to watch. Could be the biggest letdown I've ever experienced from a second part of a trilogy. There is absolutely no element of the story from Force Awakes that didn't either turn into a joke\\, totally dismiss\\, or intentionally glossed over to \\\"defy expectations\\\" the only problem is\\, you actually have to replace those plot points with others that people actually find interesting. This is a movie about a slow car chase\\, and then they tell you the slow car chase you watched was entirely pointless and they could have avoided it entirely. The name and the poster looked cool\\, but it was maybe the biggest missed opportunity for a great cast\\, great effects team and cinematographer\\, with god awful direction\\, some painfully awkward and unfunny jokes that won't age well\\, and some of the choppiest and weirdest editing choices I've almost ever witnessed in a blockbuster. The script\\, the story\\, the lack of continuity\\, everything here was a total disaster. The animal chase scene seemed more appropriate for a Harry Potter film\\, the casino planet was so cheesy and out of place. All of the jokes destroyed the vibe and would have seemed out of place even in Guardians of The Galaxy\\, which strangely gets silly jokes right. The only saving grace of this complete car wreck was Rose Tico\\, who I honestly hope gets her own standalone film like Solo. I refuse to see Solo after this car wreck\\, and how badly the fans of Star Wars have been treated by executives\\, the director and the stars wars cast. Unless there is a public apology I will not be in line opening day\\, and I will not see episode 9\\, 10 times in the theater as I have with every other star wars film since Jedi. It's almost impossible for me to believe that this movie was directed by Rian Johnson\\, I am a huge fan of Brick\\, and all of the subtly\\, wit\\, and amazing storytelling from that film were nowhere to be seen in The Last Jedi. I wish you had given Carrie Fisher the feature and tribute to her amazing character that she deserved\\, I wish she would have been able to use the force for something cooler than the weird CG moment you gave her. I'm actually shocked that this has even a 46% from the audience\\, it deserves something like 2%\\, and that's only for the poster and potential for this cast.","true":true}
