Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think this movie gets way more hate then it really should. You have great twists\\, and great action that holds you on your edge of your sit. I think it deserves the score critics gaved it. Die Hard SW fans will bash at this movie just because it \\\"ruins\\\" the SW lore. That is not the case. There is still a lot you can do with this franchise. My only problems with it were the scenes that were repeated\\, such as the throne room showdown that is almost identical to the one from Return of the Jedi\\, and the Luke plot points were way to complicated for me. Other then that\\, a great movie. Again\\, this movie gets way more hate then it really should\\, since criticality this is a good movie.","true":true}
