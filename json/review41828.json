Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is so stupid\\, you will sh!# your pants and smear it on your face.\\n\\nIt goes from one completely preposterous premise to another\\, and apparently Rian Johnson has not read or watched any of the original material because the majority of the film is based on Force \\\"super-magic\\\" (deus ex machina)\\, but only when it's convenient for the incomprehensible plot.\\n\\nThe only reason this movie has any positive reviews\\, is because Star Wars fan boys were up-voting and over-hyping it before it was even released. This thing is damn near three hours long and feels like seven\\, and at the end you realize\\, \\\"Wow\\, that was a complete flaming dog turd.\\\"\\n\\nThink Sharknado 5 with better production values\\, the ONLY redeeming quality was Benicio del Toro's acting\\, literally everything else is poorly written tripe.","true":true}
