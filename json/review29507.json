Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson is the guy you didn't let play with your Star Wars toys. I grew up with Star Wars. I had a decent amount of toys\\, though not a lot because we didn't have a lot of money\\, but some and I loved them. I saw both Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi in theaters (a bit too young for A New Hope - I was only 3 at the time)... I\\, like so very many\\, played with Star Wars action figures and toys relentlessly\\, reinacting and inventing over and over. There was ALWAYS some kid that wanted to play too who wanted to kill Luke\\, or kill Leia\\, or wanted to do nothing but make the characters have sex\\, etc etc.... That was the kid that you didn't let play Star Wars with you\\, that made you just put away your toys and go play on the swing. That kid was Rian Johnson.\\n\\nHorrible\\, horrible film. I'd simply like to say that there are so many reviews that get directly to the real issues in this (dare I even call it a) Star Wars film: lack of story\\, character arcs and motivations; disrespect of a 40 year-old universe and mythos; \\\"subversion\\\" to the point of perversion... many many well-made criticisms. \\nMeanwhile... the bulk of review that applaud this film seem to spend little or no time discussing *why* it is great\\, and much or all of the time disparaging those that are critical of it\\, calling names\\, positing that they are all misogynists\\, or other drivel that is frankly strange and childish. \\nI understand this film is divisive\\, but I cannot understand the level to which so many defend such a poorly constructed film. There is hardly a story here.. it's a soap opera\\, a slow-motion car chase\\, a commercial for toys...  There is no story of any weight whatsoever. It's just sad\\, and while it may look beautiful there is nothing here to bring anyone back for repeated viewings. It's the first Star Wars movie I won't buy or see again in the theater - I may watch it on Netflix or whatnot\\, but I'll not pay to see it again\\, because there's just nothing here.","true":true}
