Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unfortunately you can see Disney\u2019s hand all over this script. The story is a little too cutesy with an overabundance of slapstick and \u201cjokes\u201d that seem crammed into the story to lighten the mood. And the mood does need lightening as our heroes are pummeled to the Nth degree. The movie has almost none of the charm or character of previous installments and is sadly a poor continuation of The Force Awakens\\, which felt like a genuine next step in the Star Wars story.
