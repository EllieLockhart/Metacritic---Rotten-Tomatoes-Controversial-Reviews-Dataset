Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Full of racist stereotypes\\, plot holes\\, and inappropriate comedy. Corny editing and CGI work. 2.5 hour movie for what could be conveyed in 10 minutes. Also completely undermines all previously established plots\\, relationships\\, and characters form The Force Awakens. Instead of developing the characters or Rey\\, Finn\\, and Poe we get endless scenes of Kylo Ren acting like a 15 yr old boy and rehashing the same character arc that was finished in The Force Awakens. Director claims their was no time for LGBT representation so tell me why I had to sit in a public theater and watch a character milk an alien teet with my own two eyes.","true":true}
