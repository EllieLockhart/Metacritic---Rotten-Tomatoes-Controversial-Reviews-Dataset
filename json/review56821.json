{"101487":178099,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The problem with this movie\\, as with many these days\\, is just absolutely terrible writing. Other reviewers have gone into the specifics\\, so I won't spend the time. I want to address just how awful JJ Abrams is(and his cohorts such as Damon Lindelof) and why all of this is his doing. When will people realize that JJ Abrams is a terrible story teller and that his \\\"mystery boxes\\\" are completely devoid of any character\\, gravitas\\, logic\\, or soul? Everyone wants to blame Rian Johnson\\, and rightly so\\, but JJ Abrams is an executive producer\\, so he signed off on this garbage. \\n\\nMuch of the weakness from \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" comes from \\\"The Farce Awakens\\\" and the incredibly bad writing there.  It's just that somehow more people were bamboozled by it. Make no mistake\\, this is all JJ Abrams and Kathleen Kennedy\\, and it will not be improved by Episode IX. These characters were not good to begin with\\, and the things they did to Luke in this movie were an absolute travesty of character development and a real disservice to the story from the original trilogy.  \\n\\nGood stories should have enough to stand on their own. No one should feel the need to wait for the next movie to justify bad writing. Just because mediocre crap can make a billion dollars\\, does not mean it is not mediocre crap. Down with Jar Jar Abrams and his Bad Reboot Productions.","true":true}
