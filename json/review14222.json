{"101487":133013,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-24","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I give it a 1 star because ROTTEN TOMATOE DOES NOT COUNT HALF STAR RATINGS!!!! I WOULD GIVE THIS MASTER CRAP ART A NEGATIVE SCORE IF POSSIBLE!!! The rest became annoying disaster that will leave me pondering what horror of a Star Wars film did I just watch? This movie is just a complete Earth flying into the sun disaster and dishonor upon Star Wars fans. Nothing could save this film while watching. Absolutely nothing! The story was complete shit with absolutely more shitty and worthless writing that was stolen fanfic. Rian Johnson had to steal a good portion of fanfic to write a story. Dumb! Trash! Best thing fans to do is take The Force Awakens and make their own trilogy because Rian Johnson completely killed it. It's a racist\\, sexist\\, movie that insults the intellgence of women and men and makes women look completely incompetent.\\nSpoiler Alert! I am going to get extremely detailed on a ton of issues in this movie and some into the new series.\\n\\nFirst\\, this movie is a blatant insult to all the fans of Star Wars who have followed the series to some good degree. This fails to deliver good story telling and follow up to TFA (The Force Awakens). I'm gonna save the best for last. If you want to see a MAJOR issue in the story that 80% of the movie would not exist without\\, then scroll to my major plot issue.\\n\\nNow\\, TFA was a lot like The New Hope. When seeing another big planet killer weapon like the Death Star with the same flaws on it\\, it was quite a disappointment on level of stupidity\\, but I still enjoyed the movie overall even if I didn't like everything about it. I had some interest to see what it would be in Episode 8 and to answer the questions TFA emphasized and brought up. Sadly\\, TLJ (The Last Jedi) failed to bring anything intriguing and the more I saw the less I liked.  They stuck with making the beginning like Star Wars Empire Strikes Back. Transport taking off on a planet trying to escape the First Order discovery and hunt down. The last battle at the end was a white planet with very similar Hoth battle set up. They even had a guy taste the ground to tell the audience that it is not snow that it is salt. This movie is a bad Empire Strikes back that is so blatant obvious for anyone watching.\\nThe film really suffers from its plots and subplots. The filming is great\\, the graphics are good\\, and they have some really awesome scenes that I can see people looking for eye candy to be entertain by and like it; however\\, people who actually are story driven and more logical cannot possible like it\\, ignoring the \\\"I love Star Wars no matter what\\\" fanboy\/girls.\\n\\n1. Rey is a Mary Sue. Unfortunately\\, this point is proven in Episode 8 that the stronger Kylo gets through his hard training to the Dark Side: Rey will also become stronger\\, yet without any real training. It's the Force that gives her everything. Whatever! I liked Rey in TFA and I had hoped she'd would use a double bladed light saber due to her familiar use of a staff\\, which would make sense\\, but I am also a USA Knight fighter and using a light saber\\, especially a single hand weapon without prior training\\, is difficult and dangerous. It's not something you get good at overnight or over a few weeks\\, especially against highly trained and experience fighters. She manages to beat such individuals and this one multiple at the same time.\\n2. Force Balance... I am not sure this is what the Force Balance implied when it comes to light and dark. This film turns that if there is more Light then there has to be an equal of Dark\\, so this series now has more problems with this issue. I could write a long time on this subject a lone\\, but I am going to spar the readers from this\\, but it is now predictable on where Episode 9 will go and must go to stay true to this new lore.\\n3. The First Order. This is an issue with both films. The movies failed to give any background on why there is a First Order in the first place\\, and how it came to power after their main weapon and forces were defeated in TFA. TLJ suddenly starts in chaotic \\\"Resistance\\\" being annihilated from existence and the First Order in complete galactic control. WTH happen? Oh\\, we have to read some visual books to get the story? Thanks Destiny! I mean Disney... Why are all their ships slower than the Resistance? So\\, a Star Destroyer can chase a smaller episode and board it in a New Hope\\, yet no First Order ships can catch up to the rebels? Also why is there no shields on their big ships? Dreadnought does not have any shields?\\n4. Rose... She is a worthless character created for diversity\\, or let's say modified for it. Now we have some weird love triangles going on here. If it wasn't for Holdo\\, there would be no place for her. The most hated scene is her preventing Fin from making the ultimate sacrifice to save the people he love and die a hero rather than a fleeing coward. She does this whole stupid speech about \\\"I saved you\\\" and \\\"it is about saving the ones we love\\\" the exact thing he was trying to due and then the First Order blows up the door to leave them to vulnerable to kill everyone that he was willing to die to save thanks to this woman\\, and then she is like awkwardly does this force kiss Fin\\, leaving Fin with this look of you are a dumb bitch look upon his face. It was a huge WTF expression left on his face..\\n5. Laws are broken. Bombers in this movie apparently apply gravity in space and ignore the vacuum of space.\\n6. Leah... We can all agree how dumb founded we felt watching that scene of Super Leah!\\n7. Sidequest - The sidequest of Rose and Fin was the dumbest Harry Potter and PETA forced political  scenes in Star Wars history. I prefer to hear about the seductive reasoning of Anakin's hatred of sand again than to watch that scene.\\n8. Luke... Was it necessary to scar my eyes and kids with the tit milking and drinking? Really? You can't help but be a twisted pervert Disney... Luke is a butchered character. He was willing to help and turn Darth Vader\\, his father\\, who had done a lot of bad things and refused to fight or kill him\\, yet he wanted to murder Ben in his sleep? I am pretty sure they could have found a better explanation because they just make Luke\\, one the original heroes\\, into a crazy hypocritical bitter whiner. Terrible! \\n9. This movie a gotchya bitch slap you in the face. This whole movie is to try to get you to think one thing and slap you in the face. Holdo is a traitor? NOPE *Slap!* Gonna answer Rey's parent question mirror? NOPE! It's a worthless scene! *SLAP!* Oh\\, no her parents are worthless nobodies... *SLAP!* Is Phasma gonna be useful in the film? Nope! *Slap!* Remember that Sea Dragon battle with Rey that was planned? Here it is in the background\\, but it won't be fought... *Slap!* Leah died... NOPE *SLAP!* Luke is here and going to fight Kylo! Nope! Force projection! *SLAP!!!* Rian Johnson: \\\" I am going Slap Happy!\\\"\\n10: Little was answered in this film\\, but the little that was turned out extremely disappointing. The movie created more conflicting questions.\\n11. Light speed is now a weapon? Okay\\, why have they not been using it as weapon ever until now to destroy major fleets? You lose more ships and lives in space combat\\, and it now seems irrelevant on why anyone would want to engage in combat when you can create auto ships to light speed into enemies\\, including planets. with devastating effectiveness. Who needs Death Stars when you can create a decent size light speed missile?\\n12. MAJOR Plot flaw for the ENTIRE MOVIE was Holdo. Yes\\, this film story would never exist if it wasn't for Holdo. Luke would be alive or died in another fashion. There would exist more rebel fighters if it wasn't for her. I literally could not help\\, but tell my friend\\, \\\"HOLD THE DOOR\\,\\\" when she was introduce because I thought the guy said Holdor. The stupid purple hair lady of feminist. This movie actually does more harm to feminist if you look at this story plot. How is she such a disaster of a character and harm to feminist? Let's first focus on the commander position. They are engaged in a long turtle race that is only a matter of time before they run out of fuel and get killed. Everyone knows this\\, and it gets more desperate as time goes and losing ship after ship. People do not want to sit around and wait for their time to die when they have some power of resisting or hope to live. Commander Holdo refused to tell Poe and the crew the plan\\, likely to make him look like a sexist male figure to show that we should had trusted the female leader\\, this refusal to inform your crew of a plan\\, even at gun point\\, fails to inspire troops and ensure confidence in your command\\, especially when it was just granted to you in a tragic lost. This is the time to show your worthiness of command and earn the respect of your followers\\, yet she fails and in that failure she cost more lives. How? She refused to tell Poe that\\, understandably\\, lead Poe to take matters into their hands to try to save the Resistance because of incompetent Command\\,\\, which was lead for us to believe or think she is a traitor: Poe even states she's a traitor later on to enforce this perception to help those who suspect that to get another bitch slap. Now\\, we have Fin trying to escape and leave because he actually has a brain to get off this disaster\\, but he gets stopped by fangirl Rose. These two go to Poe to explain a plan about a disabling the light speed tracker on Snoke's ship\\, whom didn't even know his ship had such a thing on his own bloody ship and had to have general Huxs point that out. Anyways\\, this sidequest subplot lead to Fin and Rose getting this 2nd master hacker that they had to settle with by conveniently being in the same jail cell with the guy\\, who could have walked out any time\\, but he for some reasoned happened to be in that cell and stayed in there just in time for Fin and Rose to get thrown in. Totally not convenient at all..*Rolls Eyes*. This person leads to betraying the Resistance when they get caught causing more Resistance fighters to be slaughter\\, the last Hoth battle to occur\\, and the death of Luke Skywalker. It all happened because Holdo refused to be an actual competent commander and to inspire her forces in desperate times when troops are facing complete destruction by running away waiting for their deaths to occur. If she would have told Poe\\, this would had all been avoided. They made females like dominant commanders in this film on screen and made them completely incompetent and showed why women should not lead. It is like women leaders have lead the Republic to ruins and destruction. Rey is only good because the Force makes her a Mary Sue of everything\\, and it has nothing to due with her own hard struggles\\, will\\, determination\\, and skill. She even begs a male figure to quote. \\\"Show her her place in all this.\\\" Damn! I would think feminist would hate this movie. Phasma was a completely worthless character again. If she returns in the Episode 9\\, she will be a joke of the Star Wars series: the Kenny of Star Wars\\, she will be. She is a talented actress and interesting character\\, but they did not do anything with her in TFA and TLJ\\, but kill her off quickly and make her look pathetic. \\n\\nI did not have major issues with the Prequels or TFA. They all had their good and bad\\, but this episode kills the future of Star Wars for me and many fans. I will say that I did not like Kylo in TFA\\, but I did like his character more in this film and Rey less; however\\, this film is still pretty much trash and terrible story telling. I have seen this film multiple times because of my job\\, but it gets worse and confirms what I have been thinking on this film since I saw it. I would give it a 4\/10 rating. The only thing good about this film are the visual affects and  a scene or two. Everything else is dumb\\, pointless\\, and violation to my childhood. Star Wars\\, and story-telling. I may even say this movie made miss Jar Jar Binks. At least he created a long fun hatred of the character\\, this film leads to a salty end of Star Wars where I no longer care about Episode 9 or anything. In fact\\, I think they should do a reboot of this series with an actual good story teller and competent writer. I don't need Marvel humor in Star Wars either\\, especially when it is failed Marvel humor. It is out of place \\, and it was done so poorly that it became cringey.","true":true}
