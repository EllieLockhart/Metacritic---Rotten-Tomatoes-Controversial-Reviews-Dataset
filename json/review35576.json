Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a desecration of everything that was magical and pure about Star Wars. It disrespects beloved characters. It reduces the Force to plain superhero powers. The humor is dry and tasteless. The pacing is awkward at best. The plot is meaningless. The music is underwhelming. The movie blatantly pushes Hollywood political agendas. It's a brainwashing cash grab and it's corrupted to the core. It genuinely felt wrong. I never wanna see this monstrosity again and I'm done with the franchise. Cinematography was outstanding.","true":true}
