Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is out of touch with Star Wars. It seems to totally ignore the vast amount of available content that could have been brought to the big screen. Instead what was brought was rotten. It failed to deliver a Star Wars experience. Frankly the story was lacking and the jokes were trying way to hard. Star Wars isnt a comedy.. it doesn't need a laugh every 10 minutes.. they clearly tryed way to hard and failed.","true":true}
