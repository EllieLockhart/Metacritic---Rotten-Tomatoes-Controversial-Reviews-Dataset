Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cringe worthy lame jokes.\\nInsulting a legendary character.\\nAlthough I must say it could have been a good movie but ended up being a poor one. I am normally bias for Star wars movie but I cant this time. Just cant. Can't bring myself to watch it the second times although I did\\, hence the review here.\\nUnlike Force Awaken\\, this one feels \\\"meh\\\" after I finish watching it.","true":true}
