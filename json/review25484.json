Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Normally\\, I heed user reviews over critical reviews. Especially when so many. Very interesting how there aren't many or any 3 star reviews. All either stellar or poor. Sorry people\\, but your comments on the poor side.... about it ruining franchise\\, discrediting episodes 4 - 6\\, etc.... completely idiotic. I accept that the movie had a few issues\\, but please. You left depressed? oh boo hoo. That's called emotion. That's not the Luke we know? Everyone knows that George's original plan for episodes 789 was Luke turning to dark. While he didn't exactly do THAT\\, he certainly changed his tune\\, but understandably so. After ROTJ\\, he obviously discovers life isn't roses and petunias. What did you expect? 3 movies where the galaxy is laughing and having picnics with Ewoks? PS... spoilers in reviews make you a $#@&*^\/#.","true":true}
