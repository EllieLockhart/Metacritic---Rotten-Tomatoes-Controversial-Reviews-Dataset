Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best film I have seen this year. It\u00b4s amazing. It made me cry and laugh and I want to watch it again and again\\, because it seams like everytime you watch it there\u00b4s more to the plot. Awesome filme. I love it. It\u00b4s like a christmas present early this year.","true":true}
