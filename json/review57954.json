Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What the xxxx did disney do with Luke Skywalker? My Childhood hero turned into a bitter old man who is nothing like the Luke Skywalker of the original series.This film has disappointed me so much. Messy Story lines that don't really matter to the story\\, a weak plot. Flat Characters\\, and not very likable characters\\, The acting is ok and on some parts good\\, but the story is really lousy and not worthy of the name Star Wars. I have been a livelong fan of the franchise\\, read a lot of the EU books seen all the movies numerous times. This movie breaks my heart and i get the feeling that that was just what Disney intended for. This movie feels like Evil propaganda.","true":true}
