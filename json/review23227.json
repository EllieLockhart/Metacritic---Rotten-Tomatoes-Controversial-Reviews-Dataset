Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it.  I'm a lifelong Starwars fan\\, having grown up watching the VHS of episode IV.  That said\\, I'm not that fan that has read and consumed everything that the Galaxy has to offer.  I liked the parallels and nods to the original flicks.  I also loved the departures.  Well done Rian and all.  Looking forward to IX.","true":true}
