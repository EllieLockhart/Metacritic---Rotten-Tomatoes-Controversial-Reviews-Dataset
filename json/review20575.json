Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never had to say I disliked a Star Wars film until now.  No character development or advancement at all\\, they are all in the same place they were at the end of FA.  Plot and story were disjointed and choppy.  Luke's portrayal was just awful\\, huge opportunity was missed here.  Finn was a great character who was very mishandled and his character did little to nothing in the movie.  Laura Dern's character was annoying and also used improperly\\, brought in\\, hated\\, then liked then killed off.  My guess is that you will be able to go from 7 to 9 and skip 8 without missed a beat.","true":true}
