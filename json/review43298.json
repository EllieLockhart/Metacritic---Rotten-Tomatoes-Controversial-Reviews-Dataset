Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a fun movie. My wife and I really enjoyed it. All of the actors did a great job. I should give it a 1\/2 a star though. I rarely see \\\"plot holes\\\" in movies\\, they have to be really bad. I saw most of them right off the bat. My faith in the Star Wars universe died in the last movie\\, I had put all my faith in this movie to redeem the franchise. I don't plan to watch any more Star Wars movies until they are free\\, I am done.","true":true}
