Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everything you could ask for in a Star Wars movie. This film is filled with action packed\\, emotional\\, and jaw-dropping scenes. The only flaw I saw in particular is a certain sub-plot that follows Finn and Rose. It feels a little too drawn out\\, and kind of forced in at some parts. It could definitely be edited down a bit. Other than that I have nothing else bad to say about The Last Jedi. Everything else was done either very well or flawlessly.","true":true}
