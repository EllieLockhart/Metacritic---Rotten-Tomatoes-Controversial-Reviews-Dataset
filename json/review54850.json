Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It misses every note. JJ Abrams did a good job setting up a great trilogy\\, and Rian Johnson gave NO mind to any of it. I don't care that the fan theories were all wrong. I'm only bothered with the fact that everything good about The Force Awakens was completely dropped. Almost every little detail\\, right down to the fact that Luke's force projection was holding the blue lightsaber that we all knew was destroyed (as opposed to his green lightsaber\\, which would have made every bit of sense)\\, and the fact that the opportunity to have Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker was thrown away. It was just...awful. Beautifully made\\, to show I'm being fair. But two and a half hours of thinking to myself \\\"I would have done THAT differently too!\\\" gets to be too much for me to accept this as the direction Star wars has gone in. There are 10 star Wars movies\\, this one is my 20th favorite. I'm convinced Rian Johnson actually hates Star Wars and its fans and just wanted to punish us.","true":true}
