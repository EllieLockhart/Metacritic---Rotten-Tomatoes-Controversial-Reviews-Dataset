Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a Star Wars movie written and directed by a person who quite obviously knows nothing about Star Wars or epic storytelling. I gave it a whole star\\, though it deserves none\\, because this site doesn't count anything under one whole star toward the score for the audience. They will show your review but your rating will not be added to the average. I've seen reports that if these rating had been taken into account the actual score would be around 27 and not 46.","true":true}
