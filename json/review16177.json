{"101487":136569,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm going to start off by saying that the film doesn't deserve the current 56% audience score that it is. This film is beautifully crafted by Rian Johnson\\, and I have to give him major props for what he did. The reason the audience score is so low is because people were expecting more answers and they didn't get them\\, but what they fail to realize is that there's a third film in the trilogy that has yet to come out.\\n\\nNow to the real review... There were so many things I really liked about the movie. It continues the tale of The Force Awakens in a way that feels almost completely different in tone\\, and it should. The characters are separated into groups for a majority of the film. I really liked Luke's arc in this film\\, along with Rey's. A lot of people complain that Rey is so powerful\\, yet there's no explanation... Well... again\\, there's another movie to come out\\, but think about this\\, she and Luke are the only ones using the light side of the force right now\\, so perhaps that's why she's so strong right now. I also liked Poe in this movie\\, he had a bigger role. Admiral Holdo was a nice character to have\\, you got some villain vibes from her at first\\, but in the end realized that maybe Poe wasn't right.\\n\\nThere's more I could say about the movie\\, including Kylo's arc\\, which is great\\, and Snoke\\, which is an entire other story\\, but all in all\\, I think this film will age REALLY well. Empire Strikes Back opened to bad reviews at first and now look at it. This film will easily be one of the best Star Wars films in time.\\n\\n4\/5","true":true}
