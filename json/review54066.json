Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I did not have high expectations for this film\\, not that there was no hype for yet another Star Wars movie\\, as a longtime fan of the franchise (yes the whole franchise) how could I not be? This was the single one biggest disappointment of all Star Wars films\\, the plot does not add up. In every corner there is a plothole that makes the story completely illogical. And you get a great relationship between Rey and Kylo\\, yet we have to watch the completely useless half hour bit of Finn and Rose not accomplishing anything in the movie? Not to mention the many out of place jokes. When I watched The Force Awakens the audience at the cinema\\, including myself\\, enjoyed the small jokes here and there in the movie\\, despite that I didn't like it story-wise either\\, at least the execution of it was well made and you could enjoy yourself. With The Last Jedi\\, it starts off as some sort of Star Wars parody or something\\, with a horrible \\\"prank call\\\" from Poe to Hux. The fact that \\\"critics\\\" have given this such high ratings is beyond me. I'm certain without a doubt that they'd give the movie a beating had it been another franchise by another studio. Because objectively\\, it's exatly what it deserves","true":true}
