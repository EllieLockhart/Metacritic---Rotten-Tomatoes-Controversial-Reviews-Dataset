Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was outatanding. The twists and turns that they took with all of the characters I thought were amazing\\,especially with Luke. I like the new perspective that we are given to this character. Oddly\\, it made him seem more relatable\\, more human. And with regards to Rey's parents\\, it was supposed to make the point That she doesn't need to be connected to some other character\\, or have a sacred bloodline\\, it sets her apart as her own character. A character that we can remember independently and I think that's good. If Rey had been connected to another character\\, everyone would be complaining \\\" oh they are just rehashing empire strikes back\\\" . Same thing for snoke. I for one\\, liked the new direction and what they did with all of the characters and the story.","true":true}
