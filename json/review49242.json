Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie in the series. Random subplots that don\u00e2(TM)t push the story further. Everything setup from the force awakens is trashed. Humour is cringeworthy (the hux Mum hole at the start... eek!)\\nLoved Star Wars for as long as I can remember\\, but this is trash. I have faith JJ will turn things around in episode 9!","true":true}
