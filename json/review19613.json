Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a beautiful film. Performances from everyone was powerful\\, especially Mark Hamil and Carrie Fisher. The story was intense and emotional\\, coupled with the performances and set and effects just added a level of magic to it all which yes had me smiling and crying.","true":true}
