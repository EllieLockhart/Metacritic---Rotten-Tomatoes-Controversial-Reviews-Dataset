Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great effects and some outstanding scenes. But too many unredeeming parts - including but by no means limited to: chasmic plot holes\\, glaring character anomalies\\, misplaced humour and a famine of male role-models. TFA had some of these problems...but they were microscopic in comparison.","true":true}
