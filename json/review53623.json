Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Five star for the first two thirds\\, metaphorically fist pumping and thinking best Star Wars movie ever. And then post-Snoke (about where it should have ended) it dies a horrible prolonged train wreck of a movie death. Tore my fandom heart out watching it. I suspect a production disagreement over where this franchise was going in the future made for an overly long muddled confused inconsistent meander to the credits.","true":true}
