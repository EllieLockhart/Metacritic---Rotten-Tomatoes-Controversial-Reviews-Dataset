Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A hodgepodge of multiple climatic events that may still satisfy the nostalgic itch but is laced with overall poor story telling. Take Star Wars out of it\\, analyzing just the story itself\\, and you are left with nothing more than just a bad movie.","true":true}
