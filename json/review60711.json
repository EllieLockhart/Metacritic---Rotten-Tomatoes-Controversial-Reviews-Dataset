The story here is unmatched by any other video game out there and probably 95% of movies out there\\, but it\u2019s just so heartbreaking watching these events happen to characters that you have grown to love. But that\u2019s life and sometimes stories are sad- that doesn\u2019t make them bad stories- they make you feel things. Naughty dog was in a unique situation coming into this game where we care so much about them and that could be a gift or a curse. This game would not have worked if it wasn\u2019t for the first game where they had a chance to build that backstory. I laughed and I cried. By the time it was done I just felt shaken\\, but I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what they were going for. I was left wishing things ended differently but again not because it was a bad ending\\, but because I just wanted so much more for Joel and Ellie...however this was an amazing game with ALL the feels... \u2026 Expand","true":true}
