Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall I was disappointed by this film. Disney already had a huge collection of literature to base the plot. The current plot is banal\\, and lacking in originality. Why couldn't Snoke's ship simply destroy the Correalean Cruiser? The First Order could make Starkiller Base and track through hyperspace BUT the Supreme Leader's ship could wipe out the shields of one cruiser? The character that was meant to represent the new reckless hero\\, Poe\\, was made into a fool; he brought about more rebel deaths than the First Order. And I extremely dislike that Rian Johnson wants to wipe out the memory of the original cast. I dislike the direction of Luke and his demise. Ultimately\\, I don't believe ill watch this one again\\, but I'm still hoping for some better Star Wars films-i did enjoy Rogue One.","true":true}
