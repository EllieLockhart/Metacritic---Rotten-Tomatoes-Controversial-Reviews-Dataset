Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How did this movie get approved in this state? I'm a life long Star Wars fan and I now have no interest in buying this movie or seeing episode 9. This movie completely tramples over everything they set up in episode 7 as well as the original trilogy. So very disappointing.","true":true}
