Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What was the plot exactly? A bunch of nonsense I tell ya. They pissed on everything even remotely interesting from TFA. None of the so called heroes were ever in any jeopardy. I swear half way through I wanted to leave but for the life of me thought it would get better. It did not. Feels like they're making all of this up as they go along. Too bad. Junk.","true":true}
