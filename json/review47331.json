Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a waste of money. Star wars cannot decide if it wants to leech of the popularity of the old movies or do something different so it takes the crappy middle ground and kills all the interesting older characters and has new bad actors take over. Rose Sucks. Finn sucks. Rey is an ultimate mary sue whose only good parts of the film is when she is conversing with Kylo Ren who is the only surviving character with anything interesting about him. Phasma was wasted\\, Snoke god damn wasted. Jokes were disney level crap and the film filled with cancerous SJW ideology! Okay the only people rich in the galaxy are people who sell weapons meaning rich are evil! Hurray we released some animals it made our journey worth it! Never mind the entire galaxy at risk of a dictatorship. I will definitely not watch the next installment.","true":true}
