Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was thoroughly entertained by this film and appreciated the risks they took by going in an unexpected direction with the main characters.  There were a lot of humorous points\\, but I don't feel that there were any more than were in The Force Awakens or Rogue One.  The problem is a few of the jokes fell flat and weren't as funny as the writers thought they were.  I loved the Porgs and don't think they were overused.  The film is gorgeous and beautifully shot. The dialogue gets the job done. The plot is\\, by far\\, the weakest part of the film\\, but some of the individual story elements were intriguing.  I feel like the writers were trying to inject real-world politics into the movie\\, but the attempt was heavy-handed and lacked any real substance or emotional weight. Overall\\, I enjoyed the experience\\, but I'm disappointed that it wasn't better.","true":true}
