Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I'm not sure where to start... The game is a big mixed bag for me but ultimately disappoints.\r\rFirst let me talk about what i like about the game.\r\rThe graphical\\, and visual the look of this game is stunning. it enhances  everything that the first game had\\, in terms of looks. its a beautiful game.\rThe game has fluid play\\, and is very fun for stealth based playthroughs.\r\rNow lets talk about the main reasons for my score.\r\rThe game went from a zombie type survival game to a walking dead\\, human vs human game that forgot vital game-play elements that made the first one good.\rThe story is abysmal\\, characters are uninteresting \\, and I felt like i was forcing myself to finish the game by time i hit the what i consider the half-way point.\ri felt helpless being force to play half the game as a character i had no interest in\\, and at one point raged at.\rThe Adult scenes (that i'm not against in games) felt very out of place\\, and felt as if they were added as an after thought.\rI also felt that the LGBTQ+ content ( not Ellie's relationship) in the game was shoehorned in\\, and honestly felt like it like pandering to our community.\rFurthermore the final nail in the coffin was the end of the game. I was left with a feeling of disappointment\\, and regret. i felt that i didn't get the ending we deserved\/wanted\\, and overall i felt cheated.\r\ri gave this game a 3 because in all honestly from a standalone POV with no prior knowledge of the first one. i feel like this could have been a great game. However armed with the knowledge and feelings for characters of the first game\\, and the lore behind whats happening in the world\\, this game just dose not do it for me.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
