Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are so many glaring issues with this movie. Comedy bits in serious parts of the movie have no payoff and only seem to take away from tension. In fact\\, the scenes with this bathos can no longer be taken seriously. And it would be fine if that was the tone that the movie was going for\\, but it wasn't. There was no legitimate character arcs. Fin had the exact same arc as the first movie. Snoke never created a feeling of threat. The Rey and Kylo relationship is built-up just for them to go right back to Resistance vs First Order for no apparent reason. Disney relies too heavily on the nostalgic images and ideas of the original trilogy. Luke's character in this film was a middle finger to the fans. How does this movie progress the storyline? It felt like we ended right where we started. The Fin\/Rose side-story was pointless. I don't know if I can speak for everyone\\, but when I go to see a Star Wars movie\\, I am not there to have the directors shove their political agendas down my throat. The feministic moral attempt was shallow at best. Action scenes were amateurish. Let's hope the next movie is better.","true":true}
