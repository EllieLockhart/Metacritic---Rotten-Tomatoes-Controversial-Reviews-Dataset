Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely loved it. I thought it was bold with the plot and elements of Star Wars movies. The visuals and many of the scenes take your breath away. But if you're a hard core fan who doesn't like change\\, this movie will not be for you\\, but then again\\, it's not for you. This movie is for a whole new generation of Star Wars fans\\, or fans who want something new.","true":true}
