Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A post modernist take on Star Wars\\, which makes Rey the equivalent of a toilet bowl in an art museum.  Now we know what a feminist take on Star Wars is like\\, apparently its like Transformers\\, but that wouldn't be fair\\, the robots have more character than the souless husks of \\\"identity\\\" politics we see on screen here. They even brought in a pink hair for good measure\\, because woman strong!  \\n\\nSo congrats\\, nothing in the Star Wars universe is coherent anymore\\, now relativistic kill vehicles are a thing\\, who knew\\, now every Death Star has become redundant\\, why build anything when you can just kamikaze everything at light speed.   \\n\\nAt this point the rebels #resist are little more than incompetent terrorists led by women\\, if the goal of these movies was to get me to root for the Empire\\, congrats\\, job done.  I can only wish the Empire would win and put this shambling corpse of a franchise out of its misery.\\n\\nIts not so much that the sacred was destroyed\\, as some people like to mischaracterize fanboy reactions\\, its that they took something good\\, something with potential\\, and they spat all over it with their progressive politics\\, throwing away things they did not understand had value because their ideology blinds them to human reality\\, even natural human interaction evades the progressives grasp now.  These are people who believe everyone is the same\\, yet different\\, yet interchangeable\\, their incoherent world view and ignorance of tradition and history yields cultural destruction like this.  The modern Mao's red guard are the Kathleen Kennedy and #imwithher types\\, and you are seeing now why they cannot be trusted with power.","true":true}
