Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film subverts the usual Star Wars formula in many ways\\, which is a gutsy move that I respect. However\\, subversion is not automatically good. \\n\\nIn this case\\, what we got in exchange felt rushed\\, lifeless\\, and disappointing. The film drags on for hours\\, and yet each scene is rushed\\, never given a chance to breathe before we're shot off to the next splintered plot thread. Characters\/scenes that deserved big shares of the screentime were wrapped up in minutes with intensely unsatisfying conclusions. \\n\\n***SPOILERS AHEAD***\\n\\nHow can I get excited about the confrontation with Phasma if they don't develop her character beyond \\\"remember that shiny badguy from the previous movie?\\\" She was on screen for mere minutes!\\n\\nSimilarly\\, the confrontation with Snoke was over incredibly fast. We still know nothing about him\\, so how can I be expected to feel anything when he dies? Kylo Ren had no new development\\, and his inner \\\"conflict\\\" was explained to us\\, and not really shown or felt. Therefore\\, his betrayal of Snoke felt hollow and had no punch to it. Those Red Guards sure looked cool\\, buy again\\, I have no reason to care about them and so the resulting lightsaber fight was dull\\, lifeless\\, and had no tension.\\n\\nInstead of spending desperately needed time on scenes like the aforementioned\\, we get to bounce around between several plot threads that are pointless and distracting (especially the codebreaking scheme and Casino Zone: Act 1).\\n\\nThere were a few moments in which I was entertained\\, even awed - but these were few and far between\\, gems hidden within 2.5 hours of dreck.\\n\\nDon't pay to watch this movie. Don't buy any of the merchandise. In this world\\, your dollar is your vote. Please don't vote for more of...whatever THIS is.","true":true}
