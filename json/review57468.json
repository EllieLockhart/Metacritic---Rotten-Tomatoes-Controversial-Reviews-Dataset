Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":" This movie was straight garbage. I mean dumpster fire garbage. No that's too nice. I mean drop a deuce in a trash bag that I just threw up in and put that in a burning dumpster full of dead rats garbage. More plot holes than my spaghetti strainer\\, and big ones too. No respect for the past and no development for the future. It was a 2:30 minute slow motion chase scene that ended in still chasing. The disrespect to the fans and to Luke is astounding. Idk what else to say. I added an account just to get this off my chest. ","true":true}
