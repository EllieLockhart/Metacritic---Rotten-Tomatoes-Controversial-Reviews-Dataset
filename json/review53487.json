Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't listen to the butthurt fanboy purists! No matter what they see they will HATE it.  This movie is fantastic! The performances are all FANTASTIC.  Every single actor pulled their A game.  The humour is quite funny\\, and I dare fanboys to compare it to their beloved episode 6.  1 word: ewoks.  There was a LOT of character developement in this movie.  Every character had something.  Here is a list:  Rey and Kylo Ren's conflict\/friendship? Was stunning and one of the MAIN highlights of the film.  It was a FANTASTIC performance from each.  Poe's struggle against power was also something I loved.  Luke\\, though not what many people expected\\, was the highlight of the film for me.  Mark Hamill put out the best performance of his life.  Another thing I loved was the Yoda part.  They used a puppet\\, which was done specifically for the fanboys.  The one plot I didn't much enjoy was Finn and Rose's.  I felt like it was a little forced (geddit) that being said\\, I thought the casino planet was very cool\\, and I loved Benicio Del Toro's  character.  The plot was pretty great.  The characters were pretty great.  The locations were pretty great.  The effects were pretty great.  Enough said!","true":true}
