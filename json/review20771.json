Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to like this. I really did. But there was way too much going on in this movie that it halted the development of the Sequel Trilogy's plot. It didn't add to anything that was set up in TFA. It was almost as if TFA never happened. This movie was just really disjointed while not providing an explanation for anything that occurred. Like the Leia scene. WTF was that? It was just a bad movie. That was something I never\\, in my wildest dreams\\, thought I would be saying about The Last Jedi.","true":true}
