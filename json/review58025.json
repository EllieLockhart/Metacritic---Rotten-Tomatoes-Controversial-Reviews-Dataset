Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While this is not a perfect movie by any stretch of the imagination\\, the audience score I feel is very unfair. The main criticism of TFA was that it was too cookie-cutter and didn't take any risks. I feel that TLJ is the response to that criticism. You can't have it both ways people! This film took risks. I respect that. \\n\\nLuke Skywalker\\, for me\\, growing up was one of my biggest heroes in film. I was very anxious to see him portrayed in this movie. I maintain that while I didn't agree with some of the character choices made and feel disappointment in his arc in some ways\\, Luke was still fantastically portrayed by Mark Hamill. I still love and always will love Luke Skywalker and find him bittersweet in this movie. Which I think...is kind of the point here guys. \\n\\nI'm rating the movie higher than I would otherwise\\, just seeing the ridiculously low score. I feel it needs to be made up for to some degree. I would rate this movie 8\/10.","true":true}
