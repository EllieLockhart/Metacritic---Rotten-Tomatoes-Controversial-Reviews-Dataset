Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic film! There's a serious dichotomy going on with this film\\, but I felt like it lived up to the hype and played with the original mythology in a way I found refreshing.","true":true}
