Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved The Last Jedi when I saw it in theatres. I'm a huge Star Wars fan and have been since I was a child\\, and I consider myself to have been lucky to have seen all the films in episodic order. I'm VERY invested in the overall arc of the Skywalker Saga\\, so when the sequel trilogy was announced\\, I wasn't skeptical\\, I was excited.\\nNow\\, I'm desperately counting down the days til The Rise of Skywalker puts this thing to sleep\\, and I can move on with my life.\\nThe Last Jedi is an example of an \\\"entertaining sci-fi blockbuster\\\" but an ABSOLUTELY AWFUL Star Wars film. As I've mentioned previously\\, I loved it when I first watched it. The acting\\, cinematography\\, directing and general presentation of the film are leaps and bounds better than any other Star Wars film in my opinion\\, and when I'm in a cinema watching something like this\\, that's what really sticks out to me and gets me hooked. But\\, when watching it on a smaller screen\\, I start to notice things that I really wish I hadn't. \\nTHE STORY. IT IS TERRIBLE\\, UNFAITHFUL AND UTTERLY BORING.\\nTHE CHARACTERS. THERE AREN'T ANY.\\nWhen you realise that an entire subplot the film spends a fair chunk of time focusing on was completely irrelevant to the central story (I'm looking at you\\, Rose and Finn)\\, you now know that deep down in the heart of this film\\, something got lost and died. \\nWhat irritates me the most about this film is that I cannot put my finger on what that deceased thing is. There are many things that I supposedly should be annoyed about as a fan but I'm not. To say this film is shoving in SJW politics to Star Wars is giving it credit that it REALLY DOES NOT DESERVE. This is a film that thinks that an empowered female is a tall lady with purple hair that acts completely irrationally and gets half of her people killed for literally no reason other than \\\"I'm the one in charge here\\\"\\, or a woman who falls in love with and attempts to give her life for a man she has known for absolutely no time at all. Yes\\, what a fine and progressive depiction of women this is indeed! \\nI really won't go into detail about the treatment of Luke as a character\\, because we all know already what I think of that. But he's not the only one who is badly written. Rian Johnson's writing isn't just unfaithful to the characters of the original trilogy\\, it's unfaithful to the characters introduced in the film that this one is meant to be a direct sequel to! Finn's character arc practically repeats itself note for note\\, as if he wasn't even present for The Force Awakens\\, taking Poe out of the film wouldn't have changed a single thing about it\\, and Rey\\, well\\, she goes from being a Jedi in training to being a Jedi in training. I really shouldn't be able to sum up the character arc of the leading protagonist in the film that quickly. \\nOverall\\, if you're a Star Wars fan on the level that I am\\, I can only recommend this to you if you want to know absolutely EVERYTHING that happens in the Skywalker Saga canonically\\, but otherwise avoid this like the plague that it is. If you aren't a Star Wars fan\\, you'll probably find this enjoyable enough on a technical level.","true":true}
