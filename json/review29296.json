Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian beautifully inspires us on a journey of self reflection that challenges us to learn from our failures and to look inside ourselves for our belonging.  The message of hope in realizing that anybody can make a significant impact no matter where you come from and that the living Force does not care about a patriarchal bloodline.  That we must not win by fighting what we hate but rather by saving what we love.  That no one is ever really gone and that there always hope for redemption and belonging.  It's what Star Wars was always supposed to really represent.  He uses beautiful imagery to convey the character's growth and journey unlike any other director.  My favourite Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back.","true":true}
