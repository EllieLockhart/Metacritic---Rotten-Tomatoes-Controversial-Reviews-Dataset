Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst movie I ve never seen in my life. The worst star wars ! It is a shame. Hope Rian Johnson will have no right to produce any other movie. He destroyed the value of Star Wars heritage. He didn t understand nothing to the story. Never come in France\\, you are not welcome. The return of the jedi\\, is the last star wars movie. Lucas should have never sold to Disney. They have destroyed it.","true":true}
