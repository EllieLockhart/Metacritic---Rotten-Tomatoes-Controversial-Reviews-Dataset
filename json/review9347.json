Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"George Lucas should be feeling better about the prequels; they have been made considerably better by comparison to this assault on Star Wars. I call it an \\\"assault\\\" because that is the only way to make sense of this jumbled mess. The priority was on taking down everything that was considered good in the original trilogy and subverting or negating it. All the joy\\, triumph\\, and positive aspects of the originals have been taken out back and shot\\, to be replaced by the dour\\, nihilistic\\, and negative.","true":true}
