Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As the new chapter of the Star Wars Saga\\, Director\/Writer Rian Johnson delivers an impactful\\, humorous\\, and most emotions in Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi. This film has no time gap and it begins where the Force Awakens left off. Rey finds Luke Skywalker and hands him his lightsaber. She convinces him to train her and fight Kylo Ren and the First Order - that is ALL I have to say. This is Mark Hamill\u2019s best portrayal as Luke Skywalker in the Saga. Poe Dameron does a BETTER job than he did in The Force Awakens - but that doesn\u2019t mean he did a bad job in the predecessor. Rose\\, played Kelly Marie Tran\\, was such a likable and interesting character\\, and her chemistry with Finn was actually funny and exciting. This is by far\\, Adam Driver\u2019s BEST portrayal as Ben Solo\/Kylo Ren. There wasn\u2019t a single CGI shot that I thought was cringed\\, ILM does an amazing job on this film. This film was beautifully shot thanks to Steve Yedlin - the colors and center shots with the space battles were freaking cool. My favorite part of the entire film was the battle of Crait. The Last Jedi is the most emotional\\, funniest\\, and most AWESOME outing in the Saga. This is the BEST film since Star Was: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back. We love you Carrie Fisher. 9.7\/10.","true":true}
