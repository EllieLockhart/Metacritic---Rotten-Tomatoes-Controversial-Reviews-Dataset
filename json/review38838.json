Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They have actually dismantled star wars with a mary sue character\\, they have wasted the character of luke skywalker and really befudged the whole idea that is behind star wars with a terrible political correctness\\, female empowerment sjw agenda. I disliked that film even more because I once liked the original films so much more.\\n\\nhan shot first\\n\\nThis is just a very very bad movie\\, made with very much money. If i could give a negative rating\\, i would. I would throw all negative ratings i have for a year on this film. I have to give one star because i want this to be rated\\, this deserves zero stars or less\\, but rottentomatoes doesn't count anything for the rating under one star. So one star it is.\\n\\nso\\, you got the picture. don't pay them for this. don't go and waste your time on this\\, even if you get it for free on some shady servers. You can instead do something nice with your time.\\n\\nanything. get wasted on eau de cologne if you like. or go and break you arm on some sports. Or destroy your face while playing hockey or something. anything. that's more fun than this mess.","true":true}
