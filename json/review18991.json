Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's completely justified for a Star Wars fan to feel disappointed about The Last Jedi (Snoke dying without backstory\\, Rose existing\\, characters being worsened) but ultimately I think that Rian Johnson's decision of putting lots of emotional weight and new elements into the Saga makes it better. Sure\\, there are a lot of misfires (Leia suddenly has the Force\\, Luke throwing away his lightsaber\\, \\\"laser sword\\\"\\, Holdo\\, long runtime\\, Phasma just dies\\, plot holes\\, etc.) but that doesn't stop the movie from being interesting. The cast is does a great job\\, most notably Mark Hamill\\, Carrie Fisher\\, and Andy Serkis\\, the special effects\\, action\\, and score are all expertly done (besides Rey botching a move when fighting the Praetorian Guard)\\, and Kylo is still a complex\\, if she babyish\\, villain. Overall\\, it's a good Star Wars movie but it's not as impactful as The Force Awakens and the Original Trilogy.","true":true}
