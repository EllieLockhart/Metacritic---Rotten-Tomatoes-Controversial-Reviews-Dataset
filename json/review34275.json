Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The 3D version was amazing\\, I felt all sorts of emotions and the visuals were so breathtaking that I would say that it's my fave one yet because the comedy was also top notch this time around","true":true}
