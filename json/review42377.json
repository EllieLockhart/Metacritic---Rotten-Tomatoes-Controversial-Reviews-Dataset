Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a big disappointment. Pie\\, Rey\\, and Finn made dumb decisions the entire story and constantly were fucking things up for the Resistance. Seriously hundreds of lives would have been saved if those three just decided to stay gone. Some heroes. Also\\, all of a sudden Luke is a pussy and he does for no reason. Oh and leis can survive in the vacuum of space somehow. I just want to forget that I saw this movie. But I'll see you all for Han Solo next year. I guess that's why this movie sucked.","true":true}
