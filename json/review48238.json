Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Why all the hate? I personally liked the movie and it's in my top 3. What everybody expected from Luke Skywalker? To show like Superman against some powerful Titan like Snoke. If you want that\\, go watch any from the stupid marvel movies.","true":true}
