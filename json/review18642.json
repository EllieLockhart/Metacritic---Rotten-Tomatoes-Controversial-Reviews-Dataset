Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I TOOK a while to write this review. I tried to grasp\\, why i didn't like it (and oh boy i didn't). \\n\\nI now know its the horrible tonality of the movie. While JJ set things up to be nothing spectacular but decent\\, RJ completely threw all possibilities\\, all chances for character development out of the window with the aim of \\\"subverted expectations\\\".\\n\\nThe movie is visually stunning (as is to be expected). However the new cast members are insanely boring\\, Snoke may be the worst villain of all time (Disney\\, look at your marvel studios to understand how to evolve a big super villain) and it simply toys with the fans love for the franchise without being creative in itself.\\n\\nthe discrepancy between official reviews and audience scores is stunning. I mean\\, look at it: \\\"fanatics will love it\\\"\/\\\"great new character designs\\\"?? Holy smokes\\, many professional reviewers couldn't be more wrong.","true":true}
