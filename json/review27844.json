Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pew\\, pew\\, pew\\, The End.  This is the most disrespectful film of the entire series.  If you are the type of fan that just wants an action movie\\, sure go ahead and enjoy.  If you're a fan interested on the main plot that started on episode I\\, and it's future\\, I suggest you don't waste your money\\, because all this movie is going to tell you is to take your fairy tale and shove it.  So let's just say Star Wars truly ended on Episode VI.  I have no interest on IX.  Even if they save it\\, this stain will always be there.","true":true}
