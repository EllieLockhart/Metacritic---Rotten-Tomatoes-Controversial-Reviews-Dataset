{"101487":158053,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not sure what to say about The Last Jedi as I'm majorly conflicted about it. Some parts I loved\\, such as introducing the force bond between Kylo Ren and Rey. Daisy and Adam's chemistry was easily the most natural and electric I've seen in a while. \\n\\nFinn and Rose's arc seemed to drag on for way too long\\, when the majority opinion appears to be Kylo and Rey are the most interesting characters\\, but hey\\, doesn't appear that Disney cares a whole lot about Kylo as I only see the same quote about the heroes stories continuing (FINN\\, POE & REY.) Shame that it appears the Skywalker line is being destroyed. Luke's arc was very strange... not sure if I like it or not. Feels very OC for him. No wonder Ben went to the dark side!\\n\\nI think the one thing that bothers me about this film is the Throne Room\\, with a dramatic turn\\, then continuing with Kylo following Anakin's arc. So basically in 9\\, he's going to die\\, right? I don't see how JJ can make 9 something unexpected\\, or even what any fans are interested in seeing. Feels like we've been disregarded to sell toys and appeal to the little kiddies (not like that's a bad thing\\, but don't forget who made these films so massive in the first place)","true":true}
