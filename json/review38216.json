Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The violent death Star Wars suffered in Episode 7 was somehow made more ugly by Disney Corps attempt at some pathetic mix of Mel Brooks Space Balls and Ice Pirates in Episode 8.  It was as if Disney Corp took a defibrillator to Star Wars dead body and electrocuted its already dismembered parts into a bigger mess that is now completely unrecognizable.  Now the First Order is lead by a spaz that looks like he is about to cry in every scene and a red headed stooge.  Ren was defeated by a girl who never before picked up a lightsaber.  It would be laughable if it wasn't sooooooo sad.","true":true}
