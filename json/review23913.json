Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"makes the PHantom Menace a classic compared to this piece of garbage. this is the only star wars movie i have only seen once and will definatly not buy the blu-ray. 91% from critics\\, really? Disney must be applying a lot of pressure","true":true}
