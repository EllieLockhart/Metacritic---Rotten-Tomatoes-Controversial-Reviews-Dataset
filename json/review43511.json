Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was by far the worst Star Wars I have ever seen in my life. The director did a terrible job\\, this is coming from someone who grew up as a diehard Star Wars fan. If you're a kid then whatever you're not going to be disappointed because you weren't alive during the 70's and 80's and don't know what great movies were.","true":true}
