Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Anyone who is judgeing this movie because they wanted something else from the characters is as selfish as Star Wars fans come. This was an innovative starwars movie and deserves praise","true":true}
