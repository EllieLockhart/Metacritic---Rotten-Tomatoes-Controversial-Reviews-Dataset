Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney have demonstrated how to destroy a franchise. Waste your iconic characters\\, introduce a bunch of new ones who we don't care about\\, poor story telling\\, SJW agenda\\, rubbish dialogue\\, ignore the legacy.  I won't be watching whatever rubbish they come up with as the final instalment.","true":true}
