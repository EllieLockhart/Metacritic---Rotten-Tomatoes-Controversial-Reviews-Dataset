Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I like it even more as more time passes since I watched it. I was hesitant to go see it after hearing some of the initial back lash\\, so if this is you too all I have to say don't miss out! Unless\\, you are a die-hard and hate any kind change. BUT if you are open to fresh takes and not just the remake feel that was my initial impressions of the reboot\\, or if you're a more \\\"casual fan\\\" I think you will like this movie a lot! The action and effects are fantastic but the real improvement was the acting is even better and the characters are more developed. Yes that goes for the old characters too - que the controversy. I was scared of that too but I have to say it actually made me like them event more. Without going into spoilers my only knock of the film was it felt like that there are a lot different plot arcs that you switch between making it feel a little chaotic and causes stalls in the momentum after a strong beginning... Think switching between completely different locations and characters a la GoT style. This movie is looong and it needed to be to manage to bring all the separate plots back together\\, but it did. Finally\\, what I think it did best was mimic enough of the old story lines but take a hard turn in a different direction. They really set themselves up to do something fresh and new in the next film and I am definitely on board for that.","true":true}
