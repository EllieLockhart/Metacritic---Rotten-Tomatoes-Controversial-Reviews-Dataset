Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"***SPOILERS***\\n\\nTLJ reinvents the themes that Lucas wanted to bring into the Star Wars universe with the prequels. Yes\\, Snoke is cut in half like Maul was but that's on purpose. It's not the overt evil that is the true danger but the creeping ordinary-looking Menace which can destroy the galaxy. For the prequels it was a benign and beloved politican from a beleaguered people group who was the real Phantom Menace. For the sequels it's a boyishly wounded\\, sulky brooder with the famous bloodline. That decision has angered a lot of fans but it's a deliberate thematic choice and I think a brilliant one. \\n\\nPeople are also incensed that Rey is not from a notable bloodline but just an ordinary local yokel. However that's where Anakin arises in the prequels. He's a super powerful nobody that even the Jedi overlook because of the nowhere place he comes from. The Jedi apparently don't recruit in Tatooine or Jakku. \\n\\nLucas wanted to undermine the idea that your identity is predetermined by your birth or genetics. Great Jedi can come from anywhere and even great Jedi can fall. Luke has a moment of temptation when he embraces the idea that a person can be damned before they make their choices (the \\\"would you kill baby Hitler\\\" conundrum). \\n\\nIn fact\\, most of what is being so criticized in TLJ is Johnson's faithfulness to Lucas's prequel themes.","true":true}
