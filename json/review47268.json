Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a shit-show. They really broke the whole saga totally. Can't beliefe all the plot-holes that got through \\\"quality assurance\\\".\\nDon't watch it if you ever want to enjoy Star Wars again.\\nThanks for nothing Disney!","true":true}
