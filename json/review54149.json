Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I feel bad for Rian Johnson. No script he could have came up with could satisfy over 50% of the cult following of Star Wars. Given that all die-hard fans carry the knowledge of the EU which was ret-conned 3 years ago\\, Johnson has the pressure of pleasing fans who have expectations and desires for storylines and themes of source material that is no longer canon. That aside\\, this movie doesn't quite reach perfection but delivers in action\\, visuals\\, and acting performances. Driver is able to wipe off the mopey Kylo from TFA into a determined and feared character who demands attention every time he is on screen. Ridley and Hamill perform majestically\\, with their whole story line on Acht-To rich in symbolism and purpose. Boyega\\, Isaac and Tran do their best with the storylines given to them but part of me was glad that their storyline was able to be present\\, but give way to the tension between Rey and Kylo. The opening bombing sequence had me on the edge of my seat from the get-go\\, and the lightsaber fight after Snoke was killed is a close second to Obi-Wan and Anakin's in Episode III. Normally\\, sequels are expected to be worse than the original\\, but unfortunately for Johnson\\, with the success of Empire that means only added scrutiny for this second installment in the third trilogy. I said a lot of good things\\, but preventing this movie from being 5 stars were the sideplot of Finn\\, Rose\\, and Poe. Although I liked Poe's character development\\, it didn't need all 2.5 hours to complete. This movie is worth multiple watches for the symbolism and subtleties to be captured on rather than the immediate \\\"it sucks\\, worst Star Wars movie ever\\\" conclusion that many fans are jumping to. Granted\\, almost all of the low scores are from the \\\"real\\\" fans. Being able to satisfy the average movie goer must mean \/something\/ went right. Easily in the top half of Star Wars movies for me.","true":true}
