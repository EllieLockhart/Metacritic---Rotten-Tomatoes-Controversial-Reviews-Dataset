Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the last jedi takes new and old characters alike and wants its audience to believe that a total lack of characterization is somehow complex characters growing in the face of conflict\/struggle\\, and said-struggles are nothing more than \\\"plot twists\\\" that feel as though they were written purely to jar the audience for shock value rather than implementing creative writing skills to make a cohesive\\, enjoyable plot","true":true}
