Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Waited 30 years to see Luke Skywalker in another movie and this is what we get?  Ruined a character which had meant so much to my childhood.  Deeply disappointed in the movie.  Plus\\, not good.  Huge plot holes\\, dumb one liners\\, focusing on side characters we've never heard of who aren't developed.","true":true}
