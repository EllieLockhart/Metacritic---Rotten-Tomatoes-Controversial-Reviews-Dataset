Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Another failed attempt to win the hearts of Star Wars fans. The First Order is a weak parody of the Empire. Kylo is a sad mockery of a Sith Lord. Snoak is an failed attempt at a modern day Emperor. There were redeeming nostalgic moments\\, but they were few and far between. Disney will continue to put out these movies and reap their cash rewards\\, but there is truth to the saying that you can't go home again. A valiant effort\\, but the attempts at humor were impotent more often than not. A lack of detailed explanations regarding new character backgrounds\\, bland characters (Rose\\, Finn\\, and Poe just to name a few) a near complete disregard for the original characters (Chewie\\, C-3PO\\, and R2- D2) along with uninspired\\, unnecessary and meandering plot threads doomed this movie to cinematic mediocrity. That being said\\, it was still better than The Force Awakens. ","true":true}
