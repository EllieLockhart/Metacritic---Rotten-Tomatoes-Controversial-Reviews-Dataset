Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's brave\\, it's bold and it takes the Star Wars franchise into fresh territory\\, never before explored in any previous Star Wars film. It proves that the new trilogy has compeling characters that are capable of bringing a satisfying end to the saga of the Skywalker family.","true":true}
