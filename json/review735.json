Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An awful movie that has 3 great scenes total. Force Leia\\, Luke and Yoda\\, and Luke facing Ren\\, sort of. What could have been a movie showing ths power Luke posses\\, becomes an awful action shot after action shot that shows NO light saber battles\\, and no character growth. We get teary eyed weak Ren throwing temper tantrums again. And we get stupid slow motion space chase scenes that make no logical sense. And then Ren and Rey couldn't  fight of empiral guards????? No force using? Nothing? And the forced comedy is way out of place\\, is this spaceballs 2???? Seriously....the opening scene was very spaceballs and very bad. And it gets worse. The whole movie is one massive cluster! Terrible film. Wow.","true":true}
