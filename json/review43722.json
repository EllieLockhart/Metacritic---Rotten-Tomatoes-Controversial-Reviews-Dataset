Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the first truly original and thought provoking Star Wars. It avoids the traps of the old clich\u00e9s while still providing enough satisfying epic moments we've come to love. The hard core fans want to recapture the feeling they had the first time they saw Star Wars\\, which was fresh\\, authentic and thrilling-- THIS WAS IT! Finally we had fully developed and brilliantly acted characters\\, finally we had a plot that really focused on these characters and not cheap action scenes. The hard core fans don't care about the characters\\, they don't care about getting something new\\, they care only care about a very narrow view of the Star Wars universe that completely disregards the reality of human emotion. And while there were some plot points that could be improved\\, dramatically they were still brilliantly constructed-- the plot twists were incredibly surprising\\, and every character had purpose. The story flows naturally\\, until it reaches a truly climactic moment that ties everything together. At some point\\, you have to question the tastes of the Star Wars community-- they don't know a good movie when they see one. \\nAs for the details of the movie: \\nFirst the humor\\, which many fans have called cringey. Have you seen the original trilogy? C3PO\\, R2D2\\, Chewbacca and Yoda are all sources of cheap laughs. Yeah this movie wasn't the definition of a comedy but the jokes served their purpose as comedic relief effectively. \\nSecond\\, Snoke's back story. Again\\, let me remind everyone that we knew nothing about Palpatine in the original trilogy. His backstory is irrelevant- this isn't a story about Snoke\\, it's about Kylo Ren. Deal with it. \\nThird\\, Kylo Ren's ambiguity and apparent weak personality. I think many fans do not understand this character because he doesn't fit into the black and white representations of evil and good established in the first movies. I have also read many reviews claiming that this is somehow an attack on men who are being replaced by too smart and too powerful women. Not only is this not true\\, but it would be fine if it were. Kylo is powerful because he is conflicted (just like Anakin and Luke) and the constant battle within him\\, the fear\\, the anger\\, the impulsiveness\\, is what makes him dangerous and the most intricate villain I have seen in a while. He is soft and somehow evokes sympathy\\, but his evil comes out even more in this context. Adam Driver deserves an Oscar nomination.\\nOn Luke. Not only was this character brilliantly recrafted\\, Mark Hamill suddenly learned how to act. There is criticism that his death lacked excitement- I totally disagree. He fulfils his duty and\\, like Yoda\\, is swept away to leave room for a new generation of heroes. \\nThis movie wasn't the sort of hand out that hard core fans wanted\\, but it was a fresh revival of the saga that ultimately gives it credibility as a stand alone movie. Get over your fan fiction\\, this was a good movie.","true":true}
