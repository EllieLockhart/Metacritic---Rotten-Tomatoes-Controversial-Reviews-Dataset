Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its time to end this rebellion saga.story line nothing new\\,corny outdated comedy\\,lazer guns that bounces only when fired\\,same old recycled story\\,dumb villian for not sensing kylo ren by reading his mind in advanced\\,same with Darth Vader saving young luke by lifting his master and throwing his ass onto a reactor ( almost same formula of story)rouge one is the only true star wars story  theve done fresh\\,VIi and VIii old mixed bag story of hope and empire and return all together.","true":true}
