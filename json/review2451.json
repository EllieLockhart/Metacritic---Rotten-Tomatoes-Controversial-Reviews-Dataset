Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A very good movie\\, though not what we would have expected or what fans wanted. But the franchise does need new ideas not just rehashing old Lucas plots and story lines. Some characters were under utilized while others shined with glory and sparked a fire.","true":true}
