Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It literally sucks balls. An insult to anyone with an iota of intelligence. I don't need to beleaguer the point\\, others have stated it much better than I could have. My disappointment and rage prevent me from writing a balanced\\, well spoken review.","true":true}
