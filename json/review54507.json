Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love Star Wars so this is given some benefit of the doubt.   During the movie\\, I was generally enthralled\\, but there were definitely plot holes.   By the time I left the movie\\, I was more dismayed at the terrible plot holes\\, lack of continuity\\, etc. and simply can't 'square it' to make sense.    Some dramatic changes must be made before the next movie.    I'm not too sure about the Solo movie since it shares a taint from the same studios.","true":true}
