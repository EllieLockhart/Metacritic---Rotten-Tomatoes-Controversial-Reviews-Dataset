Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It isn't 1977-83 or 1999-06 Star Wars.  It is in many ways a much better film than the last 2 Star Wars movies.  A little darker but perhaps closer to being more \\\"real\\\".  Yes it is a massive shift in the universe but a needed one.  All said and done excellent movie and story.","true":true}
