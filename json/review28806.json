Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Raised on the original trilogy\\, this might end up being my favorite Star Wars movie. It's not a better movie than The Empire Strikes Back\\, but I think I like it more\\, in some ways. The film takes your expectations the flips them\\, which I appreciate. If you go into this expecting to be spoon-fed a generic three-act popcorn story\\, you're not going to like it. You need to think about what you're watching: the motivations for the characters and why the filmmakers chose to make the decisions they did.","true":true}
