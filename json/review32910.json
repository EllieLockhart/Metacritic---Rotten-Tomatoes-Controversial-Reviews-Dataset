Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Still not really sure what the point of this movie was. Low speed space chase? Pointless side quest to Mos Vegas? Grumpy Luke? Was this a sequel to 7 or some really bad stand alone fanfilm? Oh\\, and I'm female and a fan since 77. My very liberal 20 year old hates it too.  No manbabies here. The movie just sucked. Simple as that.","true":true}
