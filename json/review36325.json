Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The main space Saga of cinema has always been a work of rather conservative - all episodes are more or less sustained in the same manner. So it was before the release of Ryan Johnson's picture. The eighth episode is a look at the Canon through the prism of postmodern\\, so to speak \\\"Star Wars for Millennials\\\" - with a ton of inappropriate humor\\, undisguised fanservice\\, brazen play on nostalgia\\, disgustingly prescribed characters and dull narrative - and all this because of the unsuccessful plot\\, because the production here is beautiful\\, the visual is juicy\\, and the actors work at the limit of their capabilities. A few of the pros and break into pieces about the horrible script of the backbone\\, forcing us to count down the minutes until the end\\, most would have ended this mess.","true":true}
