Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie totally destroyed my love of Star Wars.  I was so tired of it being defended and told that if I did not like I should not have watched it.  Well I certainly did not see it since and is the reason I did not watch Solo in the theatre.  Why so late for this review?  I finally saw Solo at home and it was actually pretty good.  It is a pity they threw away everything built up on in all previous movies for no apparent reason other than the Jack ass director thought it would be a good idea and somehow someone let him get away with it.","true":true}
