Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a truly special movie. Everything is on point. From the characters to the direction\\, to the cinematography\\, the writing\\, the story\\, and the feeling the movie gives you. This is everything I've ever wanted from a Star Wars movie because everything in this is something I didn't know I wanted. \\nThe Force Awakens was good\\, but it borrowed too much from the original Star Wars movie. This is a unique story that goes in a bold new direction\\, whilst also being a love letter to the fans who have stuck with the franchise for this long. It also brilliantly ties together the themes from the previous movie. I once thought that nothing could ever top The Empire Strikes Back\\, it could never be done\\, but Rian Johnson proved me wrong\\, creating the BEST Star Wars movie.","true":true}
