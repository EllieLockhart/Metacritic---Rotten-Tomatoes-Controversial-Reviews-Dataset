Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great addition to the Star Wars franchise. Took the series in a new direction\\, while still remaining true to the franchise. It's definitely different than the other films in the series\\, but as a fan of both Star Wars and films in general\\, I appreciated the originality. ","true":true}
