Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A fundamental misunderstanding of what Star Wars is. Detestable and dismissive\\, riddled with plot holes and illogical storytelling. Slap stick humour that falls flat at every turn and characters that are created in a focus group.","true":true}
