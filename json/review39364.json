Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is fundamentally flawed. Luke would have NEVER have given up.\\n\\nRian Johnson has crafted a superbly entertaining sci-fi fantasy popcorn film that DOES NOT BELONG in the Star Wars franchise.\\n\\nWe beg Disney to accept their error and prove to be good stewards of the Star Wars story and respect our beloved characters.","true":true}
