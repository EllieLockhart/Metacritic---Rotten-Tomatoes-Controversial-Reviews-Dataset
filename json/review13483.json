Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If anyone is reading this : Watching this movie in theatres is what it feels like to get hustled and robbed. This is what backstabbing feels like without the knife. \\nTerrible actors. Terrible writers. Just terrible the whole way. Disgrace to the original gangstas who made Star Wars come to fruition. Disgrace to its loyal fans. \\nI had written a much longer variation of this review - but its pointless at this time. The damage is done to its fans.","true":true}
