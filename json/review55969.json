Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rotten Tomatoes \\\"critics\\\" are complete sell outs. There is NO WAY this mediocre Disney abomination can get 90+% rating and no one of those so called critics would raise a voice. Cookie cutter plot with cliche script and lifeless \\\"acting\\\" all around. Complete joke. Its an insult to the intelligence of the audience. There is exactly ONE scene that is not a complete overused cliche. They really need Christopher Nolan or some other real director to pick up the movie or just file it all with avengers and pirates BS.","true":true}
