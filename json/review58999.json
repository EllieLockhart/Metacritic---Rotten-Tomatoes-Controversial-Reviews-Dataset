They try so hard to make you feel bad about the main antagonist that they forgot about the game.\rGameplay is amazing and all. But I wouldn't believe the same team did write the story of this game.\r\rIt's not a bad game\\, but no one waited the last of us for the gameplay but the story.\rThey dedicated more time on the rope physics (which are amazing) than the develop of the second and last part of the story.\rAnd the ending it just shouted out loud \\\"We are making a 3rd game\\\".\rI'm not mad about the ending\\, I'm mad about how it happened.\r\rIn summary\\, this was like a school project.
