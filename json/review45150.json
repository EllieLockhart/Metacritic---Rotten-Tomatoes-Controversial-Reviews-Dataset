Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unfortunately\\, this is the worst Star Wars movie ever released and also the absolute worst two and a half hour long movie I have ever watched in my life. Even if this movie wasn't Star Wars and was some stand alone movie\\, I would have the same opinion. It is so disappointing. I had no expectations going into the movie\\, but it was just so horrible I couldn't wait for it to be over about half way in.","true":true}
