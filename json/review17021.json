Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really don't understand where all the negative reviews come from with this film. Sure it's not the best Star Wars film but it's not a bad one either. So the truth of Ray's parentage and Snoke's identity didn't play out in the way anyone guessed it would but that's no reason to hate the film. It is a great film\\, the only let downs are that Canto Bight scene and the ending is a lot less hopeful than any other Star Wars film.  The acting is  good\\, the story was good but sadly dark and the fight scenes were excellent ","true":true}
