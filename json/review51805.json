Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A FAILURE at every level:\\n\\n[1] FAILED as a Sequel by completely disregarding all the questions Force Awakens set up.\\n\\n[2] FAILED as a middle instalment by killing off anticipation for Episode IX.\\n\\n[3] FAILED at humour because the 'jokes' were cringe-worthy and distracting. \\n\\n[4] Failed at pathos\/drama because even the death of Luke Skywalker had no emotional impact.\\n\\n[5] FAILED at Sci-Fi because apparently there's gravity to make bombs fall in space and people can survive and even fly in its vacuum. \\n\\n[6] FAILED at fantasy by diminishing the idea of heroes and taking a giant dump on SW mythology and lore.\\n\\n[7] FAILED as entertainment because it was the first SW film that felt too long.\\n\\n[8] FAILED at political commentary because it was so heavy-handed audiences felt lectured. \\n\\n[9] FAILED at \\\"being\\\" Star Wars because even the prequels captured more of the spirit of SW than this.\\n\\n[10] FAILED box-office expectations by having the biggest 2nd week plunge in film history.","true":true}
