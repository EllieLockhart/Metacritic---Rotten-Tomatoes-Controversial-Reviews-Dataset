Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing.  Every time this movie bothered to get any traction it was interrupted by a cringe worthy decision by the director.  Hopefully this is the last jedi movie Rian Johnson ever directs.  It will go down in history as the biggest disappointment since The Phantom Menace.","true":true}
