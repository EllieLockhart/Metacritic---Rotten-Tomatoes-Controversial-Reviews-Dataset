Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For the first time ever I walked out of a star wars movie feeling nothing. It is weird to say that but I always get a sense of joy and happiness while watching any star wars films. This movie made me appreciate the prequels and the original vision that Lucas had for his franchise. I'm not saying that its horrible. It's actually okay but not worth watching a second time.","true":true}
