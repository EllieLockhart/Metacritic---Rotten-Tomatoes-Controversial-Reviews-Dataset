Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Quick and easy list of why this flopped: 1) None of the characters developed into anything . You care less about them after the credits than you did before. 2) the story itself is boring. A starship running out of gas is a central plot element...lol. 3) it doesn't expand the Jedi universe...it destroys the old one and replaces it with Avengers. 4) the comedy is awkward and out of place. 5) despite Disney's marketing\\, there is nothing epic about this movie. Feels like a really long made for tv episode. 6) open racism\\, gender politics and class warfare throughout without any attempt to build them into the story...just vomited onto the screen as if I were watching cable political news. In short\\, Star Wars has been Disneyfied...avoid this film if you value the originals (or if you just value a good movie).","true":true}
