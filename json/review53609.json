Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Filmwise\\, I have to say the the film was very well done and had a lot of amazing scenes. However\\, viewing it as a star wars film I was definitely disappointed. My biggest issues concern the direction Johnson and Disney chose to take with both Snoke and Luke. I thought the lack of backstory and decision to kill off Snoke\\, especially considering the hype and perception of his character based on The Force Awakens was poorly done. Luke\u2019s character also didn\u2019t seem to resonate with what his character had been built on. Luke is such a central part to the Star Wars universe and the decision to kill him off just seemed wrong. Seems a bit hard to believe that Luke would buy into Rey after having only a handful of interactions with her and without providing her any sense of direction after seeing her pull to the dark. Another issue I had was the subplot with Finn and Rose\\, as it seemed to kind of halt the progression of the film and it ultimately led to a pointless confrontation with Captain Phasma. There was a lot of great parts to the film as it took a very bold direction and had some unexpected turns\\, but overall it just did not feel aligned with what Star Wars means to myself and many other fans.
