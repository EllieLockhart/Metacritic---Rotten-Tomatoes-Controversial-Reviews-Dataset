Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a fanboy\\, so this is unbiased and not a complaint because of old star wars nostalgia. The plot was rigid with hard turning points that is trying to rush the character development of 3 movies into one. What end up were unconvincing emotional performances from all of the main characters. The mechanics were also awful and uncreative. The Massive dominant First Order presence saw in The Force Awakens first gets a reduction to a fleet\\, then a few ATATs\\, it was anticlimactic. Rian Johnson tries to teach the old dog a few tricks\\, which is fine\\, but they ended up being lame laughable gimmicks. The Leia Poppin scene was hard to look at\\, that final facedown reminds you of an 80s Chinese movie or\\, Kungfu Panda. Ultimately I think the problem is with the pacing\\, some important plot turns were not built-up\/explained properly to make time for: 1. cameo from old characters 2. Zoom-ups to what will be the next star wars merchandise for children (likely a plush doll) 3. romance nobody asked for and when it happened just makes you go \\\"what!??? why???\\\" 4. A failed attempt to create an mis-en-scene outside spaceships. I think what happened was the Rian Johny was too ambitious to include everything in a movie under 3 hours\\, and rushed to have it complete in time. What end up being delivered is an incoherent essay handed in by a smart but unorganized student minutes before deadline.","true":true}
