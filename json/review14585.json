Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a Sar Wars fan since I can remember seeing the first movie and this is the absolute worst movie in the franchise. The story is complete garbage and does nothing for the overall saga line. Abrams set up a decent build to this movie that just falls flat at every chance it had to tell an actual story. Star Wars is about more than special effects and lightsabers\\, it was about the story. That is why the original trilogy still holds up today regardless of the low tech graphics used. This movie has no actual story\\, it feels like a Michael Bay film without Megan Fox.","true":true}
