Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Were there things that I didn't like yet?  Yep.  But overall it wasn't enough to make me not like the film.  Luke is at his best yet\\, we see some new not explored aspects of the force\\, and a diverse cast that is growing through the trilogy.  Don't listen to the Empire blowhards who see the old material through rose coloured glasses - fans didn't like that movie either when it came out.  I think this will keep growing on us as we live with it more.","true":true}
