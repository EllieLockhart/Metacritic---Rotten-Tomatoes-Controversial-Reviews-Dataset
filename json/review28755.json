Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Quite a Dissapointment for sure\\, so much potential ...so many promises made..Even the trailers are BETTER than what the final product was...is that bad??..WELL\\, id say this about it..Visually its an impecable movie...take that away..and its an EMPTY  Can!!...Heartless..Without a compelling  story..The Tepid Rian Jhonson\\,will be always remember as the guy who wanted to make a Star Wars movie ..but in the process killed an extraordinary opportunity and even worse\\,was awarded by his \\\"friend\\\"\\,Mrs Kennedy\\,a NEW set of movie nonetheless..beyond creepy.DREadful.","true":true}
