Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a Star Wars fanatic. I've read all the books as a kid\\, and when they restructured the canon\\, I understood why. So\\, I began again\\, with Clone Wars\\, Rebels\\, and the Marvel Comics that fill in the gaps in between the movies.  I recommend doing this yourself\\, and it's easier now because when ROTJ ended\\, so began 30 years of stories that are now no longer official canon\\, so it's a lot easier to fill in the blanks these days. This movie is beyond amazing...tied for second place with the original\\, only behind Empire Strikes Back. If you don't understand that even Luke Skywalker can have doubts and a crisis of conscience\\, especially literally being the only Jedi left in existence\\, with the weight of the universe on his soldiers to rebuild the protectors of the galaxy then your a fool.  This movie is brilliant because it shows gods can bleed. It shows us that guess what? The galaxy is infinite\\, and there are more last names in it than Skywalker\\, Kenobi\\, and Organa.  The force flows thru everything and everyone. Not just the the heroes of our childhood.  But new heroes\\, heroes\\, like Luke\\, and Anakin\\, who came from nothing\\, and started a spark.  Now\\, it has to happen again. With new heroes\\, to carry on the memory of the old ways\\, to learn from the mistakes and make the universe better. Luke didn't have a Jedi council\\, a temple the size of a small country filled with allies to help him deal with the struggle.  He was the strongest force wielder since his father\\, but in the end he was still just a flawed man.  Hamill was brilliant in this movie and in the end\\, like Qui-gon\\, Kenobi\\, and Yoda before him did what he needed to do to ensure the balance would live on.  I honestly feel if you hated the shake up this movie delivers\\, then your familiarity with Star Wars begins and ends with the current 9 movies\\, and that tells me you really don't understand or respect the true scope of the canon. The universe is so much richer than that.","true":true}
