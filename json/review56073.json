Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some parts I genuinely enjoyed\\, others I groaned at.\\n\\nIt's a mixed bag...    one that I would have walked away with less mixed feelings if Finn and Rose's pointless busy work was stripped from the film. It fealt like they had no clue what to do with them so they just stuck them with crap that was never going to garner a grade (or real purpose).\\n\\nLet the characters deliver the humor in character guys and lay off the physical and CG gags \\n\\nLeia's Marry Poppins moment...   You'll know when you see it. Didn't really sell me on that. Maybe for you it will.","true":true}
