Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a huge Star Wars fan for my whole life I'm praying that Rian Johnson won't get to do the next trilogy. During the Canto Bight scene I had to leave the theatre. I simply couldn't bear the Harry Potter style. This movie deserves a negative rating. The fanbase would be better off if Rian Johnson never shot this movie.\\nI btw. enjoyed 'The Force Awakens' and 'Rogue One' very much and am still looking forward to 'Solo'.","true":true}
