Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi?\\n\\nMark Hamill was awesome\\, yet he portrayed a Luke Skywalker that i was NOT familiar with. Daisy Ridley was wooden\\, i did not connect with her character at all. Adam Driver was intense\\, he was a conflicted and truly interesting character that wielded the Dark Side of the Force. John Boyega was quality\\, Oscar Isaacs was relentless and always wanted to blow stuff up\\, Carrie Fisher was very mystical and legendary and the Porgs were cute. \\n\\nThe story had ALOT going on\\, with loads of plot holes and uninteresting things. But it also had some great scenes\\, cameos and setups for the next installment. There were some AMAZING visual action scenes in this film. But NOT ONE LIGHTSABER DUEL\\, Which was MASSIVELY disappointing. \\n\\nThe last Jedi fell terribly flat with me\\, and as a massive star wars fan\\, i was hoping it wouldn't. \\n\\nThere are loads of things that bring this film up\\, but also unavoidable things that bring this film down. I was entertained\\, but not amazed. I left the film with an air of frustration and disappointment of what Could've been.\\n\\n6\/10","true":true}
