Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The entire movie frustrated me as it was terrible writing\\, weird visually\\, stupid humor and to me didn't feel a thing like Star Wars.\\n\\nThe writer just thought it would be cool to throw in a bunch of twists and turns just for the \\\"shock\\\" factor and apparently forgot the story along the way.\\n\\nI actually liked some of the new characters from The Force Awakens. After seeing this I have no vested interest in their story any longer and could care less what happens to them in Episode 9.","true":true}
