Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was a refreshing change from the normal Star Wars themes\\, an update from the older ideas. Interesting notions about authority\\, failure\\, the costs of war\\, and being a leader vs a hero. The battle sequences at the beginning and end were a little intense for kids but otherwise it was fantastic. I don't quite understand the negative feedback. Sure some of the plot points were a little on the nose--like animal abuse and war profiteering are bad\\, but otherwise it was fantastic.","true":true}
