Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*Spoiler Alert*\\n\\nEpisode VIII:  If you have Luke dead when Rey gets to the island and have her just go get the Jedi coloring books\\, erase Snoke from VII and have Kylo acting on his own or under the echo of Vader\\, then have a plucky character named Rose among the 6 Resistance members that managed to survive Episode VIII be among the 6 Resistance members that get on the Falcon after Rey gets back from the island with the coloring books (and some Chewbacca Chickens)\\, there was no need for Episode VIII at all.  Oh\\, and when all of the unchanged characters get back on the falcon\\, a character named Rose will be there.\\n\\nSo\\, to recap\\, everything that happened in Episode 8 that mattered: The crawl runs\\, then Luke died\\, but didn't do anything helpful or tell us anything useful.  Snoke died\\, but he didn't tell us anything useful or do anything\\, either.  Rey has Jedi coloring books\\, now.  Roll credits.\\n\\nSome other things that happened but wouldn't have changed anything if we'd have just skipped to Episode IX: Poe got in trouble for being daring.  Leia\\, Finn and Chewbacca (who got some chickens) were the same at the end as they were at the beginning.  Kylo Ren lost his helmet\\, but is still not sure if he's good or bad.  The Knights of Ren were in VIII even less than VII.  Rey succeeds at everything she does in a movie supposedly about how failure is our greatest teacher\\, and ostensibly this makes her more awesome at force stuff.  Yoda preforms divine intervention to blow up a tree that doesn't do anything at all or have any significance\\, but without any explanation of what it doesn't do\\, expects us to give a crap it got blown up.  Yoda gives us wisdom from posters with silly cats on them\\, or sayings printed on a first grader's prize pencils that have nothing to do with the movie.  Oh\\, damn!  Rose -- how did I forget Rose!  So\\, there's this character named Rose and -- I forgot what she does\\, but she's adorable\\, like the chickens.","true":true}
