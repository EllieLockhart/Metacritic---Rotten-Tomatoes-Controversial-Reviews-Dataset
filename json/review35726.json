Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a well done mix of humor and action (as always) but added a hint of suspense\\, which is just what the Star Wars Saga needed. Great ensemble performance (but especially Mark Hamill) and despite the fact that the entire sequence with General Holdo seemed as if it was just for the explosion\\, there are no major flaws.","true":true}
