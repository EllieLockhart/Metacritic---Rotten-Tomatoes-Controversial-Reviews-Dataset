Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a spectacle! It honors its roots while being bold and risky. Plotting a new narrative thread in the episodic saga that results in an epic\\, thrilling\\, and emotional sci-fi adventure. \\n\\nThe film follows a familiar structure to Empire\\, but Rian Johnson takes a risky direction\\, raising questions about an essential order of the Star Wars universe that hold major implications for the entire Star Wars story. The film crafts an interesting new plot thread that's executed and justified well\\, and\\, honestly\\, looks like Rian Johnson has taken risks that already paid off. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi makes a leap from Awakens by developing its main characters\\, Rey and Kylo Ren. The film explores their relationships with their masters\\, their desire to find their place in the universe\\, and their developing mastery of the force. The circumstances of Rey and Kylo Ren are explored further\\, and what they feel and how they respond is compelling\\, thanks to incredible performances by Ridley and Driver.  These characters have an interesting parallel that have yet to be maximized but have been examined and developed here. There's one more film left\\, and it'll be interesting to see what these characters will do next\\, and if there's anything up their sleeve. \\n\\nMeanwhile\\, the Resistance is on the ropes and sends Finn and Rose to find a codebreaker to help them escape the First Order. Their narrative captures a rare Star Wars angle on how affected life in the galaxy is because of war. The epic scale of the film is great but made even better by incorporating a smaller\\, emotional\\, and personal tale. \\n\\nUltimately\\, Mark Hamill plays a Luke Skywalker like we've never seen- conflicted and scared. But Mark Hamill delivers the best form of Luke we will ever see\\, because we see his best and worst. Additionally\\, the highlight of the film is Luke and Rey's relationship\\, allowing the film to ruminate on the legacy of the jedi. Fans have been meaning to find out what Luke meant when he said he wanted the jedi to end\\, and Luke justifies his argument. \\n\\nOverall\\, The Last Jedi employs everything great about Star Wars with some modern blockbuster chops. Rian Johnson did an incredible job crafting a Star Wars story that's fresh and surprising. \\n\\n9\/10","true":true}
