Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to write a review here as I am sick of reading so-called critic reviews that are unconditionally praising this bloated mess of a movie.  The studio's allied sites appear to be posting propaganda stating that anyone criticizing this movie is just a whiny fanboy trying to cling on to their childhood.  No\\, that's not it.  I am just amazed that serious journalists have abandoned their critical faculties in praise of this dumb movie.\\n\\nLuke Skywalker bears no relation whatsoever to the character I know.  He's now a bitter\\, defeated old man who milks space cows?  Give me a break.  Not credible.  \\n\\nRian Johnson clearly wanted to flip the bird at Star Wars fans\\, and did just that.\\n\\nNot to mention Leia Poppins and a casino planet yawnfest which slowed the pacing of the film completely.  \\n\\nAbrams has absolutely nothing to work with for Episode IX.  Good luck with that\\, JJ. Crap movie.","true":true}
