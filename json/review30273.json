Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"saw this train wreck of a movie the other day. I am astonished at the so called professional reviews giving this a 91%.What did they see? Did they not see Snoke a Main new character killed off  for no reason\\, who was he? Its like if they had killed the emperor in Empire at the start of that movie!! I nearly threw up when i saw this and wanted to walk out.Also how did leia float away in space after being blown apart on the bridge and luke than died from projecting his image. I mean the list is endless. A Disgrace !! Everyone I now who saw it was like what the heck was that horror.When movie ended the whole theatre just walked out in shock\\, no clapping just low talk about how bad it actually was..The whole audience!!! Finally i see user rating is somehow 49% \\, as one star reviews are now from top to bottom and endless.What is this scam all about ????","true":true}
