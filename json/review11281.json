Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly the worst star wars movie I've ever seen. I absolutely loved TFA and was so excited about the direction that was being taken with the new trilogy. This movie completely undid all good will TFA created and then some. Literally every even semi-interesting thread from TFA was smashed to bits in this film\\, and ruined. When I caught myself trying to get into this movie any serious moment was ruined by some horrible slap-stick \\\"comedy\\\" bit that completely took away from the moment. What a downer of a movie. Maybe long time fans of the series aren't the target demographic anymore.","true":true}
