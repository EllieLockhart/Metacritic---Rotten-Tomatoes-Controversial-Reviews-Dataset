Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With all the talk of alt - right groups and such being responsible for the low viewer score\\, I felt the sign up and post a score. Not that that going to help the rating because it just isn't a good movie. It isn't so much a bad Star Wars movie: I was fine with the direction they took the story in\\, but the execution was lacking in many places.\\n\\nThe pacing was all over the place. The attempts at humor fell flat most of the time. Character motivations were either illogical or absent altogether. And there were plotholes large enough to fly the Deathstar through. Now I'm usually quit easy to please movie-wise\\, if the story and characters are engaging I'll get invested in the movie and not notice most of these things. And there were certainly moments TLJ pulled me in just to push me straight out again with a bad joke or questionable scene. I mean when it was good it was really awesome\\, but when it was bad it was prequels level cringe worthy. \\n\\nMy daughter is possibly even a bigger Star Wars fan than I am\\, and Rey is her second favorite SW character ever (just loosing out to Jyn). She's seen every new Star Wars movie in the cinema multiple times\\, the more times the better\\, and when I asked her the other day if she wanted to see it again her answer was: naaaah.","true":true}
