Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's visually stunning but sort of a narrative mess.  I found the movie underwhelming as a whole and overlong.  Mark Hamill was a weak link but really\\, if you take the nostalgia goggles off\\, he was a weak link in the original trilogy as well.  Great voice actor\\, but not a great actor.  Snoke has to go down as one of the most poorly developed villains in film history.  Any way\\, was the movie bad? no\\, it was okay.  Just sort of meh","true":true}
