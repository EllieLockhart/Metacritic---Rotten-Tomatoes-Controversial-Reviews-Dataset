Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is garbage\\, there is no level except visuals on which it doesn't fail miserably. Of course that was the design. From the purposeful rape of the source material generally to the desecration of the beloved characters and Star Wars mythos\\, this movie does leaves no good thing undestroyed. Disgusting. The feminism\\, socialism\\, SJW trash is poison\\, but even without it this movie would still be horrible. Plot holes galore. Doesn't understand what Star Wars even is. \\n\\nCan't even get a simple hero story right. \\n\\nPlease stop","true":true}
