Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars movie ever made alot of ppl episode didn't like episode 7 but I thought it was good and it left a lot to be desired in 8 and setup a lot of plot points all of which they threw out the window...  the whole plot of this movie was HORRIBLE ... I can make a list of everything wrong with the move but I would be here all night.","true":true}
