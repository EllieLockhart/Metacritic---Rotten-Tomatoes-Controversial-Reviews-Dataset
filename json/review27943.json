Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot holes as wide as the pacific\\, a Mary Sue protagonist and some of the worst writing I've ever witnessed. Rian Johnson should be ashamed of this dumpster fire he created with a beloved franchise.  Kathleen Kennedy should be run out of Hollywood.","true":true}
