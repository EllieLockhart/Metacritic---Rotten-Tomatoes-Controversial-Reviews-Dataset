Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I felt obligated to write this after reading stories discrediting fan disappointment in The NY Times. First let me say that I really enjoyed A Force Awakens\\, and Rogue One. I grew up on the original 3\\, and the 3 prequels aren\u2019t worth discussing because they are just awful. I\u2019ve never read any books\\, I walked into the theater with no theories\\, I had no real expectations. This movie was so bad I nearly walked out\\, and I\u2019m still kicking myself for not. This movie tries to do far too much\\, and it fails to do just about anything it set out to do. The character development is poor for the most part\\, the nostalgic references aren\u2019t enough to salvage it\\, and of none of the Central storylines captivate or satisfy. All in all it tends to be a boring cringeworthy mess. I\u2019ll leave it at that without going into spoilers\\, because if you are anything like me you have to see to believe. They\u2019ve made a mess of this in a manner I thought only George Lucas was capable of doing","true":true}
