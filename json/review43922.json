Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Though the visuals shine this film is let down by the awful screenplay and ploting. The plot doesn't make any sense on many levels and all common sense seems to be missing from every character in the movie. Beloved characters are reduced to shadows of their former selves. Don't bother watching it's terrible.","true":true}
