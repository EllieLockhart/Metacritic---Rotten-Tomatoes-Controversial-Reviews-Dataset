Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not sure what movie the critics were watching. This movie didn't honor the legacy of SW or the characters within the universe. With this new director and the Disney Storyboard team. There was great opportunity to offer new mind blowing\\, jaw dropping cinematic moments. Like the ones I remember from my childhood. Remember being in the cockpit of the snow speeder going up and down the arctic tundra of Hoth\\, the massiveness of AT-AT\\, the dark threats of evil constantly hunting down our heroes. In this movie\\, I never really felt our heroes were in any Sophie's Choice peril. As for the movie soundtrack\\, while it still sounds like a SW movie. I haven't hummed one single song\\, or know any other SW fans who has a SW ringtone from these new movies.","true":true}
