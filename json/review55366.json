Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it. For me\\, this movie may very well topple Empire off the top spot of my list of fave SW movies. Unbelievably layered\\, rich\\, compassionate\\, enriching\\, entertaining\\, complex\\, funny\\, and so much more! It captures the depth of relationships and pushes character arcs forward in wonderful ways. There's so much to see within it that I think I'll be watching it many more times. Rian Johnson cements himself as a fine writer\/director for good with this\\, and the performances of the cast rise to meet that same quality. Adam Driver\\, in particular\\, is riveting to watch. It's a return to the SW franchise that gives SO much if you dare welcome it into your heart. Excellent stuff!","true":true}
