Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a long time star wars fan\\, grew up with tge first trilogy and prequels and I can say that this is the most badass and entertaining episode yet! Was not a fan of the force awakens fue to it's unoriginal plot but The Last Jedi made it all up to me. Strong character developement\\, jaw dropping action scenes\\, and fantastic story.\\nIt is my new favorite episode.","true":true}
