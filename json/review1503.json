Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a huge Star Wars fan I speak. Nothing \u201cFresh\u201d about this movie. Only \u201cRotten\u201d. I\u2019m really disappointed. This movie was complete garbage. Who cares what the \u201cProfessional Critics\u201d say about the film. Everyone knows the audience score is what counts. Disney really messed up. This movie had the potential of being the greatest Star Wars movie of all time\\, and they messed it up big time!","true":true}
