Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely the worst Star Wars movie made. Their SNL type shtick during serious moments took away from the film. This movie was way too long and the story line did not live up to the hype. Disney needs to get it together with the next installment because this movie felt like it was made by a lazy director!","true":true}
