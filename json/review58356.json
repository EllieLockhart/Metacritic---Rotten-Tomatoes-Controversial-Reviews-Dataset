{"101487":99553,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A few things should be expected of high quality cinema\\, and a few things are expected of bad cinema. First\\, let me explain that I am NOT comparing this to the original trilogy. Period.\\n\\nSo\\, good cinema has coherent plot threads\\, good writing\\, good pacing\\, good directing\\, acting\\, cinematography (world building)\\, and entertains. This movie absolutely entertains with good special effects and action. So\\, those who don't really want to \\\"think\\\"\\, or with a short attention span\\, or those over-awed by star wars\\, will love this movie. Cinematography is good\\, special effects are good. It has the budget of a 200-million dollar movie\\, its not going to suck at that. What does it suck at? EVERYTHING ELSE. Case in point: As part of the above\\, I would expect a movie to have internal plot coherency\\, as well as (if it is a sequal) plot coherency to its prior movie. Its not fair to compare this to the old trilogy\\, but it IS fair to compare it to the Force Awakens. There is not a single plot thread\\, a single theme\\, a single aspect of the \\\"Force Awakens\\\" which is not ignored\\, contradicted\\, or abandoned by this film. Rey had a flashback scene of her parents? Contradicted. Kylo Ren listed a series of motivations in his interactions with Rey? Contradicted. Half the movie spent wondering what is on the planet that Luke went to\\, and why he left a map to him? Contradicted\/dropped\/ignored. This movie has so little regard for its predecessor it doesn't even bother to keep track of the difference between the Resistance and the Rebel Alliance. It has so little regard for the \\\"Force Awakens\\\" that its whole fundamental political premise contradicts that movie to the point of non-sensibility. You will probably enjoy this movie if you have not seen \\\"the force awakens\\\"\\, or if you don't really remember it. If you have - well\\, try not to think too hard. Absolutely nothing in this movie makes any sense in context of the last movie. That doesn't even go into original trilogy coherency\\, which I don't think is fair. \\n\\nDoing the unexpected is not the same thing as \\\"ignoring plot threads\\\". When an entire movie is spent wondering about the secrets of the first jedi temple\\, and who Rey is\\, and trying to establish the First Order as essentially being a small terrorist group with a single powerful military base and a few ships\\, it violates the mind to just magically turn it into something akin to the Empire of a previous trilogy just because the special effects of it look cool and make for good action. There is literally zero plot coherency here\\, if you consider both of these movies as a set. ZERO.","true":true}
