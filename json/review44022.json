Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TL;DR - I felt like I was watching Spaceballs 2017. \\n\\nThe movie opens with the least star wars-y schtick you can imagine and doesn't really get better from there. The worst part is\\, I could forgive it all if Luke and Leia had been given anything resembling decent\\, meaningful deaths- but NO\\, Luke's final line is the cringiest thing in the series","true":true}
