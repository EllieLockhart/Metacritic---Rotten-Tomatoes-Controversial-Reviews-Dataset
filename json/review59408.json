We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Incredible game\\, a true masterpiece. Nothing is black and white\\, every story has multiple sides to it. This game is about ending the cycle of violence and seeing that hurting and taking away other peoples lives and happiness won't help you or bring back the people you've lost\\, but stopping before you become a true monster will bring back the light you've lost\\, whether that be through saving others and becoming their family\\, or realising that you're hurting your family and you need to help yourself and then help them so you can really find peace and happiness together. I also thoroughly enjoyed the gameplay\\, the stealth aspect of the gameplay is phenomenal\\, so much fun to do\\, and there are so many ways through scenarios\\, whether that be avoiding all together or sneaking or just going full ham. I ended up adoring every single character by the end of it\\, and really empathised with each one and their individual struggles. Made me laugh\\, made me sob crying\\, made me angry\\, made me feel peace. What an amazing game to do that and put me through all these emotions\\, especially with hating certain characters\\, and coming to understand and then love them. This is what games should be about\\, not trying to do what they know fans will like that would be repetitive\\, but something truly unique\\, giving us a new story and a push forward. I havent stopped thinking about it!! Massively reccomend.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
