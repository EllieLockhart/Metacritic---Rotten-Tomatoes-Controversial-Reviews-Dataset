Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many separate plot lines without enough character development. Film felt very predictable\\, the humour often disrupts intense scenes and felt embarrassingly goofy. Filled to the brim with disappointing deaths. Sadly most of the talent in this film is wasted.","true":true}
