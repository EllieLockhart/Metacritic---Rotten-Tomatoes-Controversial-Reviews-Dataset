Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A lot has been said already about this movie .... As a woman who saw the first Star Wars movie at 17 I am disappointed with this movie. There is no plot progression nor do the actors develop in any way. There is insufficient 'story' to  care for any of the characters. The Rey character is totally unrealistic within the Star Wars universe. Anyone can be born with talent ... but some training is needed to show it off. This movie had too many protagonists 'ging nowhere'. The whole Fin story line is totally superflous ... or maybe intended to facilitate the destruction of the Rebels? Special effect do not make a movie ... Never thought I would drop Star Wars ... But I have.","true":true}
