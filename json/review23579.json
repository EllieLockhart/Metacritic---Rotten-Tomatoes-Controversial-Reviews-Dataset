Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved this so much. It's one of my top 3 of the saga\\, and it might be my favorite\\, depending on the day. I'm thrilled that something I've loved for 40 years is growing and changing withe me and doing something really interesting and new.","true":true}
