Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"NO Spoilers:  I actually created a Rotten Tomatoes Account just to rate this horrible movie. Disney has single-handedly killed the franchise with this dumpster fire. Even if you're not a Star Wars fan\\, you'll leave feeling confused and even a bit angry. The plot was just silly and the side story seems like it was created purely for the PC\/SJW crowd (No doubt why the Critics love it - The super positive reviews from the Critics are suspicious to say the least and may prove that these guys also double as Climate Scientists during the day.)  The Direction and pacing were simply terrible and the characters were remarkably uninteresting - So much so\\, I could've cared less if they were all killed off at the end. And Space Casinos straight out of Vegas??? Are you kidding me??!! This Movie felt like it was written by a bunch of Millennials over a PS4\\, Latte\\, and Redbull fueled weekend. In the end\\, this movie was pointless\\, messy\\, and will be enough to make you stop caring for the Franchise. What a sh*t-show.\\nP.S: With the overwhelming number of negative Audience Reviews\\, I find it  impossible for this movie to still have a 48% rating.","true":true}
