Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When you have an epic with nine episodes you have to stay consistent with the past episodes in order to give the series continuity.  Now\\, I have no interest in seeing nine because the narrative changed.  It's like if Hermoine all of a sudden became a bad student\\, Aragorn joining up with Sauron\\, or Neo was'\\\"The One\\\".  Wow\\, wow\\, wow!  Mind blown! This is an epic about individuals and the hero's journey through trials\\, struggles\\, and self discovery.  Shame on you Disney for using Star Wars as a political propaganda.","true":true}
