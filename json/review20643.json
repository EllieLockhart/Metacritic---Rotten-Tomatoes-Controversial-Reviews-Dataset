Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've seen it twice. I liked it better the second time. I really feel like the writer didn't know Luke Skywalker like the rest of us. Luke would be the first to step in and help his sister\\, friends and the rebels.  there was so much squandered potential in this film. with that being said\\, it was a solid and entertaining story. A little long\\, but well done\\, if you can overlook the character assassination of Luke.","true":true}
