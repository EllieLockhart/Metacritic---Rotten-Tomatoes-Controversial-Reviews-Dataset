Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is disappointing.   Not much happens other than Snoke getting run through\\, and Luke dying for some unexplained reason.  2.5 hours is too long for such little plot progression.  The guy two seats down from me agrees\\, as he actually slept and snored through the last ? of the movie.","true":true}
