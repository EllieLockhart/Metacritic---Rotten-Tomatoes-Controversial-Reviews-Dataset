Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was completely horrible in every aspect and eliminated the only reason it mattered anymore......Luke skywalker. Luke Skywalker was completely out of character. Mark Hamill was the only good actor left and his loss in the series will be enormous. The bad guys in this movie are completely weak in every aspect. This movie has destroyed The Complete Star Wars Saga. It's an utter embarrassment. I bought all kinds of Star Wars memorabilia and used to be a huge fan. It's all in the trash now because the idea and fantasy that was Star Wars is over and ended horribly. The director and the people making this movie should have taken a page out of LOGAN.........maybe it would have turned out different.","true":true}
