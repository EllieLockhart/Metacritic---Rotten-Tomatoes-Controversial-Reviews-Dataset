Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Killed star-wars for me. Ruined Luke\\, made the First Order into buffoons. If I wanted Team Rocket level antics from major villains\\, I'd just go watch Saturday morning cartoons. Theres a myriad of issues with the film just beyond that\\, but I'm not willing to write a 2\\,000 word essay on why I hate this. Theres more articulate reviews left concerning the problems with the film. In a word\\, its a string of scenes written before the story\\, and then plot contrivances connecting them\\, with little concern to the overall universe and existing characters.","true":true}
