Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poor fan service. I went into this film with lots of build up - and Rian Johnson just undercut it all. \\n\\nMajor characters just thrown away as though disposable\\, completely leaving the viewer dissatisfied with the build up they'd been given. Previous character development from previous films just binned as people act in bizarrely uncharacteristic fashion. Random and cheap acts of nostalgia turning up to explain plot points. The least funny star wars\\, crammed with forced jokes that don't land. \\n\\nSeriously worried that this has such high reviews just because it has entertaining fight scenes.","true":true}
