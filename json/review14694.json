{"101487":133822,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-31","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never seen a worser Star Wars movie than this. Bad character writing\\, bad story writing\\, logical failures and messages that don't have to be in a Star Wars movie. It began with the Force Awakening\\, where you have to ask yourself\\, what happened in the last 30 years after Return of the Jedi? The rebellion is now the resistance and the galactic empire is now called first order.\\nSo far we got it. But The Last Jedi took the nonsense two steps further.\\nThe movie starts normally direct after the ending of The Force Awakens\\, because Rey is still standing in front of Luke. So the first question: How did the first order\\, specially Hucs\\, Kylo and Phasma get so fast to the basis of the resistance? Kylo was wounded\\, the had to leave the exploding planet. How did they get that fast with that many ships to the hidden basis of the resistance?\\nOk\\, now they are here and want to purge the resistance. But here we have to ask the next question. Where are all the pilots from Ep VII? Does the resistance no longer have A-Wings\\, Y-Wings and B-Wings? What kind of bombers are they using? Do they want to troll us? A slug is faster. These ships would always be scanned from a far and blasted out of the universe. No trick to win time would help. But luckily one bomber made it and the gunner opens the lower door to extract the bombs. But bombs are not falling out of a spaceship\\, when a door opens. They get sucked out and the gunner too\\, but he is laying there like in normal atmosphere. Bombs don't fall downwards in space\\, when I park my spaceship above another one. Who wrote this shit?\\nDamerons trick to win time. What stupid guy wrote this? The first order looks like they are run by a bunch of idiots. Vader would have blasted Dameron and his ship after the first word. Vader never made any joke. Thats why he is the most impressive movie villain of all time. But in this movie everything has to be a joke.\\nThen the commando bridge with Ackbar and Leia explodes. Great - it's like look here is Admiral Ackbar - oh dead. And Leia never used the force actively\\, but here she can fly like Superman in space. Was the writer of the script on drugs? She should be dead. If not\\, all force users in the future should be able to fly around in the space like this.\\nThe whole situation about the chase. Spaceships don't use fuel. Once in motion it is moving till stopped. But the First Order has to chase the ships\\, because\\n- they don't have boarding ships anymore\\n- they cannot send T-Fighters (remember Ep IV how far away that one T-Fighter was from the Death Star)\\n- they cannot jump out of the system and jump in on another position\\nStupid storywriting again!\\nWhat else? Holdos plan. No she cannot tell Dameron\\, because then the senseless plot around Finn and Rose would never happen. There is NO reason to not tell Dameron. Not telling only causes problems. But at least Holdo sacrifices herself\\, though it's not necessary. There is autopilot for this and she is all time standing on the window\\, while crashing with Snokes destroyer. Another garbage. If this would work\\, no need for fighting anymore. Take some ships and crash all star destroyers and death stars like this.\\nThe sidestory with Finn and Rose was completely out of the Star Wars universe. And they had no time for this\\, the fuel lasting only for hours\\, a hyperspace jump takes some hours (remember Ep IV Tatooine to Alderaan). It looked like a mix of James Bond\\, Free Willy and Harry Potter. A casino in Star Wars should look different. Would have been a good option to bring in the criminal elements of the Star Wars universe. But no\\, we have to talk about weapon lobby\\, slavery and freeing animals\\, because we have to make some kind of allegorie in Star Wars. Stupid writers. Star Wars was never meant as an allegorie like this. And what did this side story bring? Nothing.\\nFinn and Rose stranded at the star destroyer\\, get betrayed by DJ\\, who one minute before gave the amulet back to Rose. Then they should get executed and everything is exploding. Only Finn and Rose rise again. But look - Phasma who was standing by the side of this two walks into the room again from afar with new troops. How did she do this? Teleport somewhere else during the explosion? It doesn't matter - another wasted character.\\nReys and Lukes story. Luke was leaving behind a map to find him. Now that they found him\\, he doesn't like it. Where is the logic in this? Luke\\, this Jedi\\, who saw the light in the most evil villain of the galaxy and wanted to redeem him\\, even surrendered himself to Vader and Palpatine to fulfill this\\, is now presented to us as a crazy murderer\\, because he has seen a glimpse of evil in his nephew. ARE YOU FOR REAL? This is not Luke Skywalker. Please\\, Rian Johnson\\, go home and make your homework\\, before shooting a Star Wars movie.\\nLuke denied the force for a long time\\, but he can force project himself to another planet\\, to fight Kylo Ren there\\, only to die anyway after the battle. Why not let him have a real heroic battle\\, Mr. Johnson? I can tell you. Because your creativity level is that of a stone\\, not to mention your logical sense.\\nBut hey\\, we have the cool connection between Rey and Kylo\\, and Rey is training herself. Who needs a teacher for the force? The whole plot around her falls apart. her parents are nothing. Then why even making a mystery out of it? Makes no sense and is a waste of time. But at least she is stronger than Yoda\\, Obi-Wan\\, Vader\\, Luke and all other force users together - out of nothing.\\nYOU ARE KILLING THE WHOLE FRANCHISE WITH THIS!\\nAnd we lose the new villain Snoke. Nobody knows who he was\\, where he came from and why he knew everything about Vader\\, the emperor and so on. He died stupid. Why did not Yoda simply kill him. He was even able to kill the tree with a lightning\\, though he is only a force ghost?\\nCongratulations Disney\\, you made it. And the worse\\, you promised this so called director another trilogy. Neither you\\, nor Kathleen Kennedy or Rian Johnson should ever be allowed to make a Star Wars movie again.","true":true}
