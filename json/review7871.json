Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Exceptionally poor writing influenced by current modish politics which will date the film very badly going forward. So many subplots were dropped that had been setup The Force Awakens - likely due to the chaotic changes of director. Characters are poorly drafted and developed\\, and real violence is done to the beloved canon of the series. The film i.s actually written so poorly that I think it does possibly terminal damage to the franchise\\, which is quite the achievement given how well loved Star Wars is. I hope Disney proves me wrong.","true":true}
