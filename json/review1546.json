Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a life long Star Wars fan I am disappointed... This film left more holes than TFA and similar to Rogue One did not live up to the hype of the trailer. Some scenes were good others were ruined.... Porgs were not needed.  No major fight scenes. Hux and Ren are just children around each other and are nothing compared to Tarkin and Vader.  Not sure if this is even worth seeing more than once.  If you are a hard core fan don\u0092t let the critics fool you. This was not a good film\\, maybe a B- at most.","true":true}
