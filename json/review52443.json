Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A great movie which entertains a lot. It payed homage to the Originals and Sequels by a lot of parallels and establishing and exploring Luke as a ccharacter. Still\\, Rian Johnson couldn't seem to resist adding the latest \\\"in-every-superhero-movie-found\\\" humor that took away some of the movie's original \\\"Star Wars feeling\\\" and pushed it more towards an usual blockbuster feeling.\\nGood\\, but not as good as \\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\"\\, though The Last Jedi had more than one shocking moment.","true":true}
