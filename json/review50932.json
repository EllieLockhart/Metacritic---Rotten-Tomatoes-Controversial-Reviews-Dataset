Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute garbage. And not because of the horrible decisions that alienated more than half the fans of the franchise to such a disrespectful extent\\, but because of the absolute vapid writing and immature directing. It feels like you're watching a hack movie with no purpose. I can't stand this fucking cheeze evil\\, after getting used to a more nuanced and intelligent approach in Game of Thrones where you actually can relate to the characters. This is just garbage writing\\, for the lowest common denominator\\, and most inexperienced and naive audience. This movie could have been a classic\\, but it went into the trashcan of forgettable formulaic writing instead. Stay away. Don't feed this abomination Disney has created.","true":true}
