Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing! They have treated the Star Wars mythology and lore with utter contempt in this diabolical disjointed movie\\, which gives true Star Wars fans the bird whilst trying to force feed viewers with a political agenda.\\n\\nPlot is flawed on many levels and defies credulity.\\n\\nMale characters are treated like goons.\\n\\nJedi lore and belief system is treated like ass paper.\\n\\nCarefully woven themes and plots from the previous movie are unceremoniously dumped in this one.","true":true}
