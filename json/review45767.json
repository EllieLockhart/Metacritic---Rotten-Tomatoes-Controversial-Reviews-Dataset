Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very lame story really hurts this movie. Luke is a whiner who can't get his act together until kicked in the butt by a green puppet. Rei's background is a huge letdown. Snoke is underdeveloped as a character and winds up marginalized. The rebellion seems to be fighting without a purpose. The empire\/first order has a ship in visual range of its entire fleet for the entire movie and can't shoot it down. And Disney used every opportunity to introduce stuffed animals for girls to buy. The suits at Disney are wrecking this.","true":true}
