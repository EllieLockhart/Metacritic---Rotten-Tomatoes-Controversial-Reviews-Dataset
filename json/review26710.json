Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok\\, so something was just off. I really\\, really wanted to like this movie. The first 10 min in...it hit me. It was like each actor started acting a few seconds after the director called for action. Throughout the movie\\, something else nagged me\\, and I couldn't put my finger on it until Roses character was introduced. Watching this Star Wars felt like an old 90s Disney afternoon show\\, or Drake and Josh. It was that bad. Once I realised this\\, on top of the huge disservice they did to Luke and Leia\\, ( did she have like 3 lines?\\, and I wont even get into the pose she strikes floating in space) \\nWe waited and were burned with the prequels. I honestly liked Force awakens\\, but this? This was just awful.","true":true}
