Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly the movie was pretty boring and it was too long. The story felt like a combination of episodes 5 and 6. The action was also boring\\, with boring lightsaber battles and boring battles in space. The only parts that were enjoyable were the few funny parts in the movie. I didn't expect much from this movie and I was still disappointed.","true":true}
