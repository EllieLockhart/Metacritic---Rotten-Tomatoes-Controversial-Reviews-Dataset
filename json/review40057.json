Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is my first time rate the movie in flixster. I am doing this only because these stupid star wars maniacs ruining its raiting. they are doing this only because Skywalker is not THAT cool in this movie. overall the movie was very good and 155 minutes felt like an hour. Kudos to the writer and director. Fuck you stupid star wars fanboys.","true":true}
