Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Whether you're a fan boy or a new-comer you should be dissapointed with this film. For those of us who have been attached to the Star Wars saga since our childhood\\, this film is a far cry and injustice to the scope and theater that Star Wars has become. So poorly written\\, dialogue such as \\\"Han was..well\\, Han\\\" (Try using your words Rian). Characters who betray every thing they are built upon in previous movies\\, leading me to utter confusion. You might say these character are dynamic and changing but I argue theyre just entirely new characters (Luke). Worst of all is the destroying of characters credibility\\, I.e. General Hux who If we are to believe that he is a general of a vicious and \\\"evil\\\" army\\, then who is he smacked around\\, made to be the butt of terrible\\, forced jokes and above all overridden and undermined in his command multiple times. *Sigh* Too much Disnification.\\n\\nThen there's the plot. A rebel fleet trying to out run the First Order\\, ohh but they're are being tracked through hyper space..oh but there's a way to disable it..oh but we need a codebreaker...oh but the characters will get side tracked..oh but they never needed that codebreaker...oh but the new guy will betray them. Seriously how did this make it past an editor. So many egregious offenses to film making\\, the series\\, the audience etc but I think the point has been made clearly. If there is any saving grace to this film It is probably the visuals. But there's more to film than that. \\n\\nIncredibly disappointing to take a successful franchise and in one foul swoop erase everything it's predicated on. I don't not recommend this film\\, wait for it to hit red box if you're interested in staying current with the series.\\n\\nNot sure if it's worth seeing anymore of these films I  theaters unfortunately.","true":true}
