Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed every minute of this movie! I usually judge how much I like a movie by how many times I looked at my watch. I was so engrossed in The Last Jedi\\, that I never looked to see what time it was! The cast was great\\, the music\\, of course\\, was five star all the way\\, the story was good\\, and the special effects were very good also. I felt this was an excellent addition to the Star Wars saga. I've been a fan since I was a teenager\\, and I hope I'll be around for several more movies if they continue to be this good.","true":true}
