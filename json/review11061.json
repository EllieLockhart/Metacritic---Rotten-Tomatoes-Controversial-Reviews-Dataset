Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Heres a basic list of what I had a problem with...\\n\\n\\n1) Corny Jokes (felt forced and dumb)\\n\\n2) Hux is now a bumbling idiot  \\n\\n3) Luke squeezing sea cow tits and drinking its milk. Wtf\\n\\n4) Leia flying in space was embarrassing \\n\\n5) Rose was pointless.\\n\\n6) 25 minute Casino scene was awful and dumb.\\n\\n7) Snoke wasted\\n\\n8) They completely mishandled Luke and his legacy.\\n\\n9) Completely crapped on TFA and everything it set up.\\n\\n10) Luke sending a hologram force projection of himself instead of showing up for real to battle Ren.","true":true}
