Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I analyzed well: Snoke's death was unnecessary\\, in fact his true power and origin was not known.\\nLuke: Ok\\, it was an epic ending but it generates a Why\\, it does not make sense\\, you see that Disney wants to kill the Skywalkers.\\n\\nNo duels with the saber\\, I seriously expected Luke and Snoke to meet.\\n\\nPhasma and Snoke were characters with a wasted history they had potential.\\n\\nThe origin of Ray is very trash\\n\\nJokes in moments where there must be seriousness.\\n\\nLeia: floating in space in the Mary Poppins style.\\n\\nThe movie is a mix of all the movies\\, I do not know but the first scene reminds me of the Battle of Hoth.
