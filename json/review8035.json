Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fans deserved better\\, this would have been more acceptable for the next movie...you've literally shit on the first trilogy in these movies. The only reason they included the old characters was to use them for shocking the audience.","true":true}
