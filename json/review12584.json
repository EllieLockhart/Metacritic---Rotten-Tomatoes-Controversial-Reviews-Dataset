Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't give this movie 1 star.\\nso bad and full of mistakes.\\nI hope disney will fix everything for the next movie or get someone who knows how to make good star wars movies.\\nWas so bad; I can't wait for the movie to be over.\\nI when over to see a movie who can answer some question and I end up with 1 big question.\\nWhy they make this movie.\\nI don't like to say anything about the story for people who haven't seen it.\\nBut I will say ( wait for redbox )","true":true}
