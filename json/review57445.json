Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was horrendous. Truly a let down for the Star Wars franchise. I won't go into detail as there's just too much to be said for how bad this movie was. I will not be going to see the final chapter as this has official killed it for me. I hope George Lucas speaks up and tells the truth on how he feels about this because it ruined his vision I'm sure.","true":true}
