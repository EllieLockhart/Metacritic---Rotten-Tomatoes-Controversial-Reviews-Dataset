Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible! It's not enough that social justice losers have destroyed comedy. They've now infected Star Wars with their ridiculous politics and virtue signaling. Shame on you Rian Johnson. Your agenda of tearing down traditions and old characters and replacing them with emasculated betas came through loud and clear.","true":true}
