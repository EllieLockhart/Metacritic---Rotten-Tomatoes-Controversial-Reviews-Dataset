Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was really excited to see this movie but from the ludicrous opening X-Wing vs Star Destroyer and Luke throwing Rey\u2019s lightsaber over his shoulder and playing hard to get for the entire movie\\, I just found myself disappointed over and over. It was like more work went into inventing cute CGI alien animals to sell as plush toys than developing the plot. Frustrating.","true":true}
