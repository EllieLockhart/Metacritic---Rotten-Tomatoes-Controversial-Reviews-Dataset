Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is an enjoyable film\\, that will leave a lasting impression for older and younger audiences. The Last Jedi really does \\\"not go the way you think\\\"\\, which is what I enjoy most about it. The film has some great twists and takes some new turns\\, yet still has nods back to the previous films. It has\\, in my opinion\\, some of the best scenes in the Star Wars saga. However\\, I still wonder what happened in between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens. You leave this film with more questions than answers.\\nAs you can tell with previous reviews\\, the fanbase is divided. Those that have invested heavily into the lore and side stories of Star Wars may be somewhat disappointed. However\\, I still enjoyed this film. I recommend going into the film with an open mind and make your own independent thoughts on the film.","true":true}
