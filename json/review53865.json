Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly\\, it's a great movie for the average fan. For Star Wars fans\\, you'll bask in moment that it's another Star Wars movie and then leave the theater with a lot to soak in. Then you'll start second guessing characters\\, plot points\\, and arcs. This is actually a good thing because I usually walk away from a Star Wars movie feeling entertained and that's all. This film caused me to have lengthy discussions with other Star Wars fans on so many levels - within the story\\, within the writing and directing\\, and within where Disney intends on taking the franchise. To me\\, this is good. Not since The Matrix have I contemplated all facets of a movie. It's not a perfect movie but neither are the characters and we forgot how imperfect they were when A New Hope first came to the big screen. Mark Hamill said it best when he said these are children who are taking over the franchise (paraphrase) so you need to understand the perspective they're sending off to viewers. They cannot further elevate and sustain the classic characters any more\\, yet they gave them their due. Instead\\, they took the new characters and are continuing to develop them in order to let them stand alone with their own agendas. It works. It's not an easy pill to swallow but Johnson does it to the best of his ability. I mean\\, I wouldn't want that colossal of a task. 4.5\/5.0","true":true}
