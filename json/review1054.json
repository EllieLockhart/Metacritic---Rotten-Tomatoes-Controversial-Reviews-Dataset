Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Another Star Wars movie with a rotten ending..UGGG!!!  Come on fellas....we don't come to see these movies to see the bad guys always win in the end...geez...please give us something to hoot and holler for.  Why do you think the original Star Wars Trilogy was so wonderful?  The good guys won in the end...duh!","true":true}
