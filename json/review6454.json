Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney went an interesting route with this one.  It's not often a corporation is stupid enough to make a movie in which their hardcore fans are depicted as awful people.  Yet\\, here we are\\, where Disney has made literally every white male in the movie a bad guy.  Oh\\, also\\, if you have any form of wealth\\, you are \\\"the worst people in the universe.\\\"  Personally\\, I am now done with Star Wars and will never go see another movie or buy any merchandise.  They have definitely lost me as a fan forever.","true":true}
