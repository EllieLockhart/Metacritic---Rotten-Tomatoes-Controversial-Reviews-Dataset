Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Total disregard for all prior stories and character development. Mostly a childish response and a attempt to bring a sega down to the levels of \\\"The Hangover\\\"  Not a serious attempt to tell a new story\\, but a regurgitation of the past with the premise that all the characters are morons. Much more like a parody then the next chapter of Skywalker sega.","true":true}
