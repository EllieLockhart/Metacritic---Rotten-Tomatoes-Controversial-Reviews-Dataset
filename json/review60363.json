Please bare my english since it is not my first language. After watching the playthrough of this game through the platform twitch since I am so excited to see some early game playthrough due to the fact that video game stores in my country do not even have the latest copies of ff7 remake and persona 5 royale and of course this shouldnt be out in stores in my country as well. 20 min watching the gameplay they **** did what is something I will never forget this director had ever done to one of the most loved character in the first game. Spoiler alert they killed joel and the worst and most despicable thing is that you will have to control the piece of **** who killed joel just to learn she hulks story. I no longer have the will to watch further into the playthrough and I also will cancel my preorder of this trash game. I am sad\\, disappointed\\, angry\\, and hateful towards not only this ****ty sequel but to the video game producers and directors of this game as well\\, sony\\, you better give us some good titles for ps5 cause xbox looks so much better right now.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
