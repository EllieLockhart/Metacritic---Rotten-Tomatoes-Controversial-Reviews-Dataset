Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"worst star wars film since attack of the clones. This movie does nothing to push the story forward at all. A lot of dumb jokes that dont land or make sense for star wars. They ruined lukes nephew making him go to an island to die from depression after trying to kill his nephew in his sleep...rey needs no training and is flawless and can lift more rocks than luke and yoda within a week of time. this movie is ridicuos and finns canto bite planet is a complete bore and adds way to much waste to the movie while adding politcal agendas. the movie is a disgrace to what star wars is and what the previous film set up.","true":true}
