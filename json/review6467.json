Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disorganized mess of a movie filled with Red Herrings\\, poorly written characters\\, weak story and an incoherent\\, bitter ending. The movie should've been named: \\\"Star Wars: Breaking Bad\\\"... Silver-lining: the actors did their job\\, but there's only so much they can do with a terrible script.","true":true}
