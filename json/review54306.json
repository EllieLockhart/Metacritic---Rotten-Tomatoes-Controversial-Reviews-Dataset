Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had to finally make a RT account just for this. The level of disappointment I felt leaving the theater last night was immense. Too much forced comedy. No pay off for any of the questions opened up by TFA. Irreparable damage to some of the most beloved characters in the whole franchise. \\n\\nI feel no anticipation for seeing an Episode 9; there's nothing left in this new trilogy for me to look forward to.
