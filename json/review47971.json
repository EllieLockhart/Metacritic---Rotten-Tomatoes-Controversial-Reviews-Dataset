Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While it's far from a perfect Star Wars flick\\, it takes bold new steps into a new era of the fandom. Rian Johnson delivers great chemistry between our two protagonists\\, Rey and Kylo Ren\/Ben Solo\\, and advances their story in  satistifying\\, albeit some small\\, ways. Even in his mid-eighties\\, John Williams delivered one heck of a score that accompanies his prior work masterfully. While some segments slow the film down\\, it makes up for itself it with a fantastic climax. Not the best Disney-era film\\, but far from bad. 9\/10","true":true}
