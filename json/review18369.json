Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I throughly enjoyed the movie\\, but my 9 year old son loved the movie. Almost 40 years after I saw a New Hope when released in the U.K. I got to see what it must have been like for me. That made this a 5* movie for me. \\nIgnore the sour puss detractors whose heads are stuck where the sun doesn't shine. Enjoy this well crafted storyline with excellent performances with sets that aren't all green screen.","true":true}
