Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can only conclude that Disney PURPOSEFULLY wanted to destroy their own franchise. They KNOWINGLY hired a terrible director; DELIBERATELY had awful jokes. As a fan\\, I  just really have to choke on the years of blood\\, sweat and tears that went into Star Wars and now all for nothing. Disney has created a child-like universe where everything is carrot and nothing is stick. DIE DISNEY DIE!","true":true}
