Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went to watch it twice\\, just in case I had really missed something but was sorely disappointed both times.  While \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" was my favorite of all the Star Wars films and Rey is my favorite character in the series\\, I simply couldn't bring myself to like what they did with this one.  Epic moments were thrown away for lame attempts at getting a laugh.  It was like the writers\/director didn't know the characters AT ALL.  This movie had the potential to be amazing but they threw away almost EVERY opportunity where a \\\"great\\\" and \\\"memorable\\\" moment could have taken place.  Leia should have died when Kylo stalled and the two other pilots blew up Leia's ship!  The levitating was ridiculous and embarassing.  That MOMENT could have been pivotal but they threw it away.  The Luke teleportation was ridiculous as well.  I can't believe this is what they came up with 2 years after the greatness that was the previous film. :(","true":true}
