Until Dawn was one of them.  I love choice\/consequence type games and I kept hearing how good this was.  After an hour into the game I was seriously thinking of just removing the game from the PS4 and pretending I never saw it.\r\rI expected a good story\\, really good voice acting considering who the VA's were\\, but all I got was an inconsistent story and voice acting that was cringe worthy at times and ok at others.  It reminded me of  B horror movie and l love a good horror movie\\, but this was your typical B movie where everything is predictable.  There were no scary moments\\, the story was all over the place with no real pacing and the controls\/camera angles were often frustratingly bad.  That could be from my inexperience with controllers\\, but I haven't had that problem in other console games.\r\rIn all I was really disappointed by the game.  Having played The Last of Us and Beyond Two souls just before Until Dawn\\, maybe I set my expectations a bit to high.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
