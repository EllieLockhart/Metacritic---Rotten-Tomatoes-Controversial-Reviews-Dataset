Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Outright terrible. Opening sequence all the way to the end of the movie either felt weak or unnecessary. Makes the previous title look good\\, which was not too bad of a picture as plot had more depth and interest ","true":true}
