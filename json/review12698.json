Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I couldn't help but be shocked by the many surprises that blindsided me\\, leaving me unable to properly review this film on first viewing. After knowing what to expect the second time\\, I can say the Last Jedi is possibly the most stunningly shot Star Wars film. There were some missed opportunities\\, and some added unnecessaries. But the Porgs!!!! And I can't help but love Poe Dameron. Definitely had some pacing issues\\, but hey\\, it's Star Wars\\, and it's wonderful.","true":true}
