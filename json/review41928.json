Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie it's like a transformers movie\\, it's made to catter the eye of the casual espectator\\, but fails as a part of a film legacy. As a long time star wats fan this movie feels like a slap in the face\\, as a cinephile this movie it's just a sad reminder of how a movie characters shouldn't be written. In the good news\\, I think totally kills my interest in the new movie.","true":true}
