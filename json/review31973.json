Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers ahead\\nI'll start off with the good: the film was visually stunning\\, with great effects particularly in the last part of the film that takes place on Crait\\, the salt planet. In the original trilogy\\, the second film was one of failure\\, and thematic-wise\\, this film also touched on that: Finn\/Rose's failed mission to take down the tracker\\, Poe's failure to trust his leaders and thus lose several Rebel lives\\, the Rebel leaders failing to communicate\\, and the revelation of Luke failing to trust Kylo. Unfortunately\\, a failure to add to that list is the overall execution of the film...\\n\\nThe bad: The plot was poorly organized and structured. While the casino storyline does fulfill the \\\"failure\\\" theme described above\\, it was a total waste of time\\, and that theme\\, along with Finn and Rose's character development could have been accomplished in other ways. Centering the whole Poe\/Leia arc around a ship outrunning the guns of a First Order destroyer was also ridiculous. Since when has ship fuel been brought up in Star Wars; we saw a First Order ship literally shoot from space to destroy a Rebel base\\, hard to believe that their lasers couldn't reach the Rebel ship \\\"escaping\\\" them on fumes; the whole tracking system through warp drive...cmon; it also seemed absolutely ridiculous that Leia\/Holdo wouldn't share their plan with Poe (even if they thought there might be a spy on the ship); don't even get me started on Leia [Mary Poppins] flying through space...Finally\\, the whole Rey\/Luke story arc was extremely disappointing as well. It was interesting character development to see Luke be not-as-perfect as we all thought (actually appreciated this bit)\\, but the \\\"lessons\\\" he taught Rey were lukewarm at best (pun intended)\\, and the whole Dark side mysterious hole thing was just weird and didn't offer any useful information to further the plot. Phasma again had a disappointing and frankly useless appearance\/death\\, and if Snoke really is dead\\, his whole buildup and demise was totally underwhelming. Finally\\, I understand the message Disney\/Johnson may have been aiming at with saying Rey's parents are basically no one (if Kylo was telling the truth)\\, but for me personally it was quite disappointing.\\n\\nOverall\\, a decent film\\, but for a Star Wars film\\, it was underwhelming. Definitely some moments that made you laugh\\, smile\\, and cry (especially in light of Carrie Fisher's death)\\, but many moments simply seemed like Disney creating future opportunities for marketing\/merch\/story lines for future books or movies. Here's hoping that Episode IX will be leaps and bounds better!","true":true}
