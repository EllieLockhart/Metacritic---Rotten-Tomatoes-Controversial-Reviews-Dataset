Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst of ALL the SW films. The SJW Politics made this movie almost unwatchable. All white men are either evil\\, incompetent\\, etc; while all major leaders are women or people of color who excel at being brave\\, capable leaders\\, and just good human beings. Lei's force flying is absurd\\, and was so cringey I almost walked out. Rey is totally unlikable\\, and yet is fully capable jedi master in like 1 day of training. No plot. No star wars mythos. No snoke backstory. No tie-in with other films other than it was a sad attempt at episode V. DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY!!!! TERRIBLE! SEND THEM A MESSAGE ON HOW BAD THIS FILM REALLY WAS!!!!!!!","true":true}
