Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just watched it again . Yoda will be turning in his grave\\, how can you have so much source material and do so little with it  I have so many questions like why was snoke so large and yet appear human . How do bombs fall in space .  Why make skywalker  so pointless . Ackbar just cast aside  dead gone . Let's not forget Luke milking a monster.. the most kick ass jedi  in the galaxy and he's a waste of film .  Disney's worse than Lucas they killed Bambi's mum and now killed starwars  still they will be able to sell some toys and monster milk fair trade  don't they get it look at the film  solo and the box office.  we don't care anymore just stop\\,  please\\, we still have at least 3 good films.","true":true}
