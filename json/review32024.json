Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS --- I can see how people would be disappointed by their fan theories not panning out\\, or the reveals maybe \\\"too dull\\\" in consideration of what could have been done; but personally\\, I enjoy the idea of someone from a family line of no importance becoming an epic hero. I think it to be actually quite poetic. The Last Jedi tastefully puts the past legacy behind while allowing the possibilities of the future to be hinted at throughout the film. Also\\, I have seen people complain about the seemingly pointless casino plot\\, but I think the importance of that plot line is two-fold: it allowed more exposure into the Star Wars universe\\, and we saw our heroes utterly fail. Their heroism is something we admire and value\\, but realizing that heroism does not mean victory is a lesson of value in itself. I think this lesson is true throughout the entirety of The Star Wars saga -- heroes may fail\\, but the good is ultimately victorious. No\\, I don't think this film was a sellout\\, rather a successful transition to Episode IX.","true":true}
