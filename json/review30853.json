Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So awful.  Forget about the \\\"critics reviews\\\" - they are kissing ass.  \\n\\nThe acting was terrible.  Jumping back and forth from scene to scene without any fluidity made it seem like it was put together in a high school movie club.  The humor was so awful\\, I was embarrassed for the actors.  \\n\\nHow did JJ Abrams let this go through?  I guarantee Lucas was pretty envious after Force Awakens\\, but not now.  He is laughing his ass off.  \\n\\nGive the people what they want - PT Barnum\\n\\nGive the people what they want\\, not your artistic interpretation which sucks.\\n\\nDisney - fire Rein Johnson from this franchise.  Pay to get rid of him.","true":true}
