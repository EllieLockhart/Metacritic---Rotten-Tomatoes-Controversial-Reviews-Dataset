{"101487":145131,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It wasn\u2019t until my second viewing of this film\\, at the very end\\, that I realized the sheer genius and brilliance of the newest entry to the Star Wars saga. Upon my first experience\\, I was like many of you\\, skeptical and conflicted with the new film. I knew that I liked it\\, but I could not decide if the bold and dramatic approach that director Rian Johnson took would bolster it to the top of my rankings\\, or fall into the mediocre disappointment of some of the other films. I have seen it again\\, and I have a definitive answer. \u201cStar Wars: The Last Jedi\u201d is possibly the best\\, if not the most important\\, Star Wars film ever. Before you continue to read\\, I warn you. Spoilers ahead. It was at the very end of the film on my second journey into a galaxy far\\, far away that I realized what I this film was all about. Luke Skywalker\\, the tattered and torn master\\, is facing down his grandson\\, Kylo Ren\\, in an saga defining showdown. Kylo tells him that the Resistance is crushed\\, that the war is over\\, and that he is about to kill the last Jedi. The wise and aged Skywalker simply tells him that everything he has said is wrong. The Resistance has been reborn\\, the war has just begun\\, and he will not be the last Jedi. This line is the perfect parallel for the franchise as a whole. Star Wars has been reborn\\, this is just the beginning\\, and it is no longer all about the Skywalkers. Though the film is not flawless\\, it boasts a clever and thought provoking story about growing old\\, growing up\\, and moving on. It is the first Star Wars film to truly show the grey in the galaxy on both sides\\, and offers us a fresh new look at The Force. No one is pure good or pure bad. There is balance. The film is burdened by an excess of characters\\, and a few plot lines that are underused or wasted. The entire side journey involving Finn and Rose traveling to the glamorous casino world of Canto Bight ends up be relatively irrelevant by the end of the film. It could\u2019ve all been taken out and the story would not have been altered that much. It should be pointed out\\, however\\, that this subplot serves as another example of the film\u2019s central themes. It serves Finn\u2019s own character development\\, as he grows into someone who realizes what\u2019s truly important in the galaxy. Initially\\, Finn is looking to abandon ship as the First Order Is hot on the Resistance\u2019s trail. He wants to get to safety so that Rey will not be in any danger when she finally returns (there is a duel tracker device that allows Rey to find the Resistance). Although Finn\u2019s actions are not completely selfless\\, they are far from the right decision. But by the end of the film\\, Canto Bight serving as an obstacle\\, Finn comes into his own as a selfless and valiant hero\\, nearly sacrificing himself for the good of the cause. Finn and Roses story\\, along with a few smaller skirmishes\\, like the battle between Captain Phasma and Finn\\, are fine\\, but often take away from the larger and more crucial story of Luke\\, Rey\\, and Kylo Ren. One instance in particular\\, where Rey and Kylo stand in the destroyed throne room of Snoke\\, Kylo\u2019s hand extended in an offer or unity to Rey\\, the movie cuts away to Finn and Rose as they face potential execution. It was infuriating. Every single scene involving either Rey or Kylo is palpable to watch\\, and it is frustrating\\, more than once\\, for the movie to break away from the main plot to follow a less important story. The good news is\\, though these sub stories are less important\\, all the characters are enjoyable to watch\\, and help to serve the greater meaning of the movie. I especially liked the inner-Resistance conflict between Poe and newcomer Vice Admiral Holdo. It showed that even our brave and noble characters often make the wrong decisions for the right reasons\\, which are costly nonetheless. By the end of the incredibly lengthy film\\, almost every great symbol and idea from the past seven films has been quite literally tossed off the slide of a cliff. The revered lightsaber of Anakin Skywalker is broken in two. The ghost of Yoda has set fire to an age old Force tree\\, imploring his old apprentice Luke to let go of the past. The mysterious and theory-provoking Snoke has been cut in half\\, allowing for Kylo Ren to become the true villain he was always meant to be. Luke Skywalker bids farewell to the physical world\\, becoming one with the force (though I predict he will return in the next episode to haunt his twisted nephew). And thanks to the terrible untimely death of Carrie Fisher last year\\, Princess Leia will not return to the fold ever again. Even the Resistance\\, which was mentioned to be 400 strong towards the beginning of the film\\, is reduced to a mere handful of survivors that can barely fill the Millennium Falcon by the time the credits roll. The Last Jedi finds losses stacked high on both sides\\, with a dark cloud hanging over our heroes and villains. But the future has never been brighter for the Star Wars franchise. Watch the film\\, listen to the dialogue\\, observe the symbolism. Rian Johnson has wiped the slate cleaning\\, allowing for a new era of Star Wars to flourish into anything it wants to be. The saga no longer requires a Skywalker presence to drive the film. The revelation of Rey\u2019s past\\, and the final scene is evidence of that. The Last Jedi paves the way for a mew landscape of Star Wars\\, one that does not have to be tied down by the weights of its predecessors. Anyone can be great. Hope can come from anywhere\\, not just a small moisture farm on Tatooine. That\u2019s what makes this film so special. ","true":true}
