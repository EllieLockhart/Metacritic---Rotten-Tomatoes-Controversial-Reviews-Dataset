Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a mess of a movie. Plot holes galore\\, poor characterization\\, a completely pointless casino planet side plot\\,  and  worst of all the treatment of Luke Skywalker. This will be the first Star Wars film I don't buy on blu ray.  It goes against the grain for me to be so negative about my beloved Star Wars but this movie is bloody awful.","true":true}
