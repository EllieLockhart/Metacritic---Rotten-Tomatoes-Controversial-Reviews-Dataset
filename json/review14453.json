Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had vague hopes Rian Johnson would deliver something at least more rewatchable than what JJ Abrams mustered. Unfortunately this was not the case and I feel naive for ever hoping the franchise could be redeemed since the classic original trilogy.","true":true}
