Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was great.  A lot of the movie had original concepts.  Definitely not what I expected at all.   It was a really impressive movie\\, and it made me think.  This give's me hope for Star wars. \\n\\nI noticed a lot of negative reviews about this movie.  And i'll put that into perspective bellow. \\n\\nMovies detailing that\\, of 100 random negative user reviews from Rotten Tomatoes\\, 94% of them either had no account or were first-time users. Of 100 random negative Metacritic user reviews\\, 72% of them were new users.\\n\\nBecause of this reason Rottern Tomatoes please change your system to allow only legitimate accounts to post reviews.  That way it will keep the review's honest.   I really do hope you can do that.  Only allow real accounts\\, with real people.  Not FAKE accounts. \\n\\nAnyone who add's an account then deletes it afterwards just to post a negative review should not count.   \\n\\nLast of all the amount of money this movie has made pretty much speaks for itself.  \\n\\nLast of all anyone who really loved this movie I would strongly encourage you to support to movie\\, and give it the rating it deserves.","true":true}
