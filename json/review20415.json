Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I understand why some fans hate this film\\, but it\u2019s for those same reasons that people should love it. It\u2019s precisely because Johnson didn\u2019t play by the rules\\, and refused to answer the conventional questions that makes this movie wonderful. No spoilers here\\, but I would describe the decisions is this movie less as \u201cshocking\u201d and more as \u201cbold.\u201d","true":true}
