Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is outdone only by The Phantom Menace in its blemish on an otherwise amazing franchise. The self-parody of Star Wars with uncharacteristic lame\\, cheesy joking throughout will induce many eye rolls. And\\, it takes all the promises from the wonderful The Force Awakens and throws them out the window as meaninglessness. Add in several unnecessary scenes and characters\\, and you have a recipe for most die-hard fans to leave feeling betrayed.","true":true}
