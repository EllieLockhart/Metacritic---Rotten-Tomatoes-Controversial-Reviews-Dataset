Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't like the Holdo character because Poe is right to be worried and the decision of not tell the plan even when she is threated her is very stupid\\, I like the Finn and Rose mission very much\\, I think it shows another interesting point of view\\, I don't think luke has a good reason to say the jedi must end\\, even if Luke thinks like that now he would resolve his mistake and then go to exile but the truth is that a jedi would never do that and least Luke\\, i think the Rey and Kylo arc is very interesting\\,  Yoda shows very later when he could show sooner\\, captain phasma and snoke are the worst and useless characters in the star wars saga and now it happens anyone can be a jedi just with being strong with the force and move a lightsaber a little\\, all felt in the sensation that has to be awesome but it happens to be very absurd","true":true}
