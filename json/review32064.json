{"101487":169479,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS\\n\\nIgnoring this as a Star Wars film\\, let's acknowledge this as a sequel to The Force Awakens\\nWhy does C3PO have 2 gold arms again?\\nWhy did Kylo's scar move?\\nWait if this movie starts with the resistance evacuation\\, and that happened right after Force Awakens ended\\, and the plot about only having 16 hours worth of fuel lasted 2 hours of the movie\\, and that last half hour took a few more hours\\, does that mean EVERYTHING in the movie happened in less than a day?\\nIf Starkiller Base was destroyed and the First Order retreated to get their bearings back and this film starts straight where the last one left off\\, why did they immediately get back on the attack and not prep for something?\\nIf Disney is celebrating inclusiveness why did they kill the strong female characters Phasma and Holdo\\, who also happening to be the main movie series' first LGBT+ character\\, as well as push their only POC actors into a D-plot that went nowhere and resulted in failure after 2 hours? When Disney says diverse do they mean they only really care about the white women\\, Rey and Leia?\\nIf JJ Abrams celebrated Force Awakens being a return to form and a throwback to the classic Star Wars filming style\\, why did Rian Johnson push for heavy use of CGI effects instead? And then why did he decide to deliberately use the old Yoda puppet but also CG on top of it?\\nIf Leia could use the force to escape space and fly back to the ship after being blown away\\, why did she never use it again? And why did nobody mention the fact she flew from space back to the ship?\\nWhy did Rian think it was funny to have Luke throw the lightsaber away almost immediately when we as an audience had to sit through a 2 hour movie previously to see him get the thing in the first place?\\nWhy did this movie attempt a more comedic approach than any Star Wars movie has ever used? Didn't the trailers\\, cast and crew all imply this movie would be the darkest? This was the goofiest Star Wars ever made\\, and not in a good way.\\n\\nNow acknowledging this as a Star Wars film:\\nWhy did Rian Johnson feel the need to show us Luke breastfeeding from an alien sloth? I'm not against breastfeeding or it being shown by any means\\, but this is Luke Skywalker\\, a 60 year old man\\, drinking milk from the boobs of a giant space sloth...\\nWhy did Yoda tell Luke to train new Jedi and begin the jedi way again in Return of the Jedi but then burn down the jedi temple in this movie and tell Luke to get fucked because Rey stole the books and doesn't need him to teach her?\\nWhy did Luke pardon a 50 year old warlord who killed countless men\\, women\\, children and others but nearly stab a kid in his sleep because he sensed a bit of the dark side in him?\\nSo Rey has no notable parents\\, doesn't need any training\\, and is supposedly the greatest jedi in the entire world but all she does is move rocks? Also when will we see her flaws...? Characters are a lot better when they have those because they seem more relatable\\, but the worst thing about her in this is... she wanted to know who her parents were and that's bad...?\\nIf flying into a big ship at warp speed not only destroys the ship but the surrounding 50 other ships around it why did nobody ever do that? Like throughout the prequels to now\\, why has nobody ever done it?\\nWhere did R2D2 go? He showed Luke Leia's video from A New Hope then disappeared forever.\\nWhy couldn't Laura Dern tell Poe the plan? Why didn't she even try? She would have saved a lot of arguments and an entire mutiny from happening.\\nWhy did Luke dodge the lightsaber on Crait if he was just projecting himself? And if it was to distract Kylo and save the others\\, why did he dodge it once then get bored and give up?\\nSince when can the ghosts actually affect the real world?\\nWhy take a character with a lot of potential like Rose and just use her to give Finn a girlfriend? Why didn't they make Finn gay for Poe like a lot of the fans were hoping for?\\nWhy did Rian just kill the characters JJ set up to be the trilogy's big bad guys? And why in such silly ways?\\nWhy couldn't Snoke hear the lightsaber moving next to him? Or see it? Why didn't his guards see it?\\nHow did Phasma fall down a hole when they were in space? Did she fall into space? In Disney's new Star Wars game a stormtrooper falls into space and she's fine and actually gets into another ship and leaves? Why didn't they do that with Phasma?\\nWhy Porgs? Other than toys\\, why? Not that there is actually a reason why\\, I know it's just for toys.\\nIf the resistance are supposed to be wise and smart why would Finn and Rose immediately give up finding the codebreaker because they were arrested after being on a planet for 5 minutes? And why would they then think it's a good idea to just hire a guy in a prison cell who tells them he can do it just cuz? Shouldn't they be suspicious of a guy who's eager to join their plan so quickly? Didn't orange Yoda tell them that one Master Codebreaker could do it? Why wouldn't they start getting suspicious when suddenly this guy can do it? Doesn't that ring a few alarm bells?\\nWhy did that kid at the end have the force? Is the force growing? Nobody said it was or even felt it. Surely if it was they'd feel it?\\nI have more questions but I cba atm\\n\\nLast Jedi wasn't the worst one but it's the most disappointing one. It's not my least favourite\\, but a longshot from my favourite. It belongs right in the middle\\, in the mediocre zone\\, where I'll probably forget about this film in a few years whilst I fondly look back at the originals.\\n\\nMaybe I'm too old for Star Wars now...
