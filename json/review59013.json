The Story is so bad and the writing doesn't make any sense. I tried giving this game a chance even after reading the leaks but the context actually made it worse. This game destroyed the characters we knew and they were doing stuff that doesn't match up with what we know about them and they made Ellie such a bad character and the game tries to force you to like characters that are so bleak and unlikable. THIS GAME DOESN'T EXIST FOR ME. Lazy writing and trying to surprise everyone with bad choices that doesn't make sense. And the ending makes it so much worse. You don't enjoy this game but you also don't learn anything from it and If it's about the cycle of violence then why is the main villain (who is a psychopath btw) is not punished for their violence but Ellie and Joel is?!\rAbsolute mess of a story and the pacing is awful.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
