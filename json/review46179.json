Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Walked into The Last Jedi with very high hopes\\, but walked out very disappointed.  The story was not the engaging adventure of cunning characters you look forward to from Star Wars.  Instead\\, it felt like a comic book movie with cheap jokes and lengthy plot-lines that went nowhere. I also did not like how Luke's character was handled one bit. Hopefully Ep9 will not be anything like this and saves this trilogy.","true":true}
