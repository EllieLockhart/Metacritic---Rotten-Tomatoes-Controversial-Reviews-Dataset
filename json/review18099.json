Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought I liked it the first time I watched it. I really tried to convince myself that it was good. I also tried to convince my friend that didn't like the film that it wasn't that bad then I realized that really is a bad film.The biggest problem I have for this film is that it could just have been a stand alone film because they didn't really care what happened in the force awakens. the last jedi had so much potential but didn't do anything with it.","true":true}
