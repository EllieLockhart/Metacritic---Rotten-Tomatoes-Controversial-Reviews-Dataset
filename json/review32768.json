Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":": Star Wars the last Jedi was a suspenseful action packed movie that will be sure to keep you at the edge of your seat. When the first order has the Galaxy in its grasp the resistance makes there last daring attempt to escape. This movie has so many twists that surprise the audience over and over again. When Rey wanted to learn the Jedi ways she had to convince Luke\\, but it wasn't that easy... Rey that that in order to save her friends she had to learn the ways of the force. So she went to Luke for help. Although this show had more humor and was less serious than the other star wars it still was action packed and filled with fun.","true":true}
