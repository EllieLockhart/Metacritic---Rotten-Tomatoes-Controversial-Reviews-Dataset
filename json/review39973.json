Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is honestly one of my least favorite star wars movies. It just feels too slow and drawn out. Also i was very disappointed in the ending because there was no cool lightsaber fight like all the other movies have. Not very interested in watching it again","true":true}
