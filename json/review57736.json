Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While this movie may be divided and clearly the internet has a mutual feeling all the way. I will say that I actually liked this movie because of how daring it was to do the complete opposite of every theory being thought up at the time. Sure I can see why some don't like this movie\\, but I can also see why some like this film. \\nNo matter if you like this movie or not\\, I think it's perfectly clear that all of us\\, as a fan base\\, care deeply for this franchise and want it to be; here's a real shocker\\, \\\"Fun\\\". I may be of the minority on this\\, but seriously; are we really willing to let differences in opinion ruin what used to be a fun and exciting franchise where we could laugh about the mistakes and still have long discussions about why we love this franchise.","true":true}
