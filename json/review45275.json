Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Upon catching the first glimpses of the 8th installment to the main Star Wars saga\\, I was blown away. I'd always enjoyed the films\\, even the infamous prequels\\, but I never imagined how much the third trilogy would blow me away. The Last Jedi is no exception. \\n\\nComing in at two and half hours\\, the film is a long one\\, and some might say that it was maybe a little too long. However\\, this was made up for in a dazzling display of special effects\\, a great score\\, and astounding acting. \\n\\nThis film didn't stack up however in the plot category. The plot meandered side to side\\, with no real sense of a story. This could be partially due to the film's focus on the Force\\, which can be just as mysterious. \\n\\nRegardless\\, the film still peaked my interest\\, and I would go see it again if I had the time. My advice for those who haven't seen it yet would be to re-watch The Force Awakens\\, as it will make sure that you are up to speed so you don't lose yourself in The Last Jedi.","true":true}
