Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney needs to stop shoving its obnoxious social agenda down our throats ruining a classic franchise. Know your audience\\, Disney. \\n\\nNot only that\\, but this script sucked big time. The professional critics must all be on crack to like this movie. Did Disney lean on you people or something?\\n\\nThe biggest problem\\, aside from all of the useless annoying subplots\\, was the disrespect to Luke's character. Destroying a hero by making him weak and killing him off was the same waste to Han Solo who died like a chump (without Luke & Leia to witness his death\\, for emotional impact\\, I might add). \\n\\n And changing hyperspace to make it trackable\\, just to create a new problem\\, was stupid.\\nAnd oh my God\\, what happened to Yoda's face? Speeder accident?","true":true}
