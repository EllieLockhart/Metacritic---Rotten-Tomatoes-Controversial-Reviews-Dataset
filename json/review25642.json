Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a perfect film\\, but after being disappointed by Force Awakens\\, this was utterly satisfying. It takes the franchise in new directions\\, while still feeling like Star Wars\\, through and through. I walked out of the theater re-experiencing the feeling of awe I had as a kid seeing A New Hope.","true":true}
