Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a huge disappointment and waste of my time and money.  Essentially\\, it felt like it was a 3 hour chase scene with the star-ships moving about 10 miles an hour.  Finn was just a filler who does not make any contribution to the film\\, Rey and Leia were boring\\, Luke was depressing and Kylo tried to be an emo vader and was not interesting as a character at all.  Also\\, all of a sudden humans can survive being in the vacuum of space? Give me a break.  This movie was too Disney-esque with lame humor\\, in fact\\, there are parts where it almost felt like I  was watching a Shrek movie (Chewie and the birds).  They are bleeding this series dry.  It's just awful.","true":true}
