Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a life long Star Wars fan I cannot emphasize enough how much this movie was everything to me.  One of the most interesting and wonderfully written of the Star Wars saga\\, nuanced and deep. LOOOOOOVED IT","true":true}
