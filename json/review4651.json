Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Complete and utter crap. Wow \\,  congratulations you ruined star wars !  I had been a massive fan since I was 6 years old \\, 30 years! You took everything great about it and destroyed it in two movies . Horrible lightsaber battles\\, no awesome displays of force powers \\, no cool lore or mythology and cool aliens .. anyone can be a Jedi now? Give me a break . Rei is the most boring character ever to enter the universe with no back story no reason to care about her blahh . Way to PC\\, way too feminist \\, you disgraced the legendary Luke Skywalker.. Gahh I want to vomit you bastards.","true":true}
