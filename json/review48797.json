Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst movie to date.\\nThe Mary Sue manages to best like skywalker in a duel\\, the first order manages to be so inept at military strategy they win\\, Kyle is still the most emotionally inconsistent man child ever\\, and Leia the Mary poppins.\\nThat's just some of the problems with this film.\\nDon't see it\\, save your money.","true":true}
