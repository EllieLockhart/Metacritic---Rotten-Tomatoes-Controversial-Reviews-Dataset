Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought The last Jedi could not be worse than it already is.\\nThen I watched the deleted scenes...\\n\\nOh my fucking God. \\n\\n- Hux harasses Rose sexually. And she (it\\, more appropriately) bites his hand and spits.\\n- A stormtrooper recognizes Finn and slaps his butt.\\n- Luke trolls MaRey teling her that some bad guys are coming to the island to rape the nuns and she runs to save them but discovers that they are nice guys who only want to dance with the ladies. \\n- Finn tells Phasma that she squealed like a whoop hog when she shut down Starkiller's shields. And Phasma kills all surrounding stormtroopers so that they don't tell anyone what they heard.\\n\\nThis movie is extremely bad\\, but it could have been really really worse.\\n\\nN.D. Please don't buy the digital download for this atrocious movie. Don't give your money to the ones who destroyed Star Wars.\\nThere are already excellent torrents around...","true":true}
