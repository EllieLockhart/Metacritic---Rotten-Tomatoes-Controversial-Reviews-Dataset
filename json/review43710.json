Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the best star was film yet it had lore \\,Action\\, bit  romance \\,Misdirection \\,lightsaber fights \\,comedy \\, suspense \\, loss and  amazing new worlds  this is the most  outstanding Star Wars collection","true":true}
