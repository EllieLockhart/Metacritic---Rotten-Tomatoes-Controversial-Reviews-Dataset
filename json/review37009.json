Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was too long\\, and the plot meandered at points. The Marvel type humor was annoying\\, and generally unnecessary. Twists and turns are great but it was deeply upsetting that the director threw out any hope of revelations about snore or two.","true":true}
