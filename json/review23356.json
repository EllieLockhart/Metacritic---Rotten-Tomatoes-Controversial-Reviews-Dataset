Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it so much. My favourite of them all. Incredibly sophisticated filmmaking; Not only was it a well-crafted shout out to the original trilogy\\, it built on its legacy and brought a freshness that didn't disappoint. Rian Johnson was the right man to pass on the baton. The moments of Kubrick-esque cinematography didn't hurt either!","true":true}
