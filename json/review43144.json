{"101487":187370,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This really is The Last Jedi\\, (movie) at least for me. Plot holes\\, weak characters\\, unnecessary and boring side quests (added to pad the film?). And why would they give Luke such a terrible character arc? He was never a coward in the original saga. Lea is a super-hero? (turns into Superman?) Snoke is a throw-away villain? Why even have him to begin with? Rey was\\, and is a Mary-Sue. It's not just nostalgia\\, I have always loved Star Wars. Not anymore. And it makes me very sad. Bad showing Disney.","true":true}
