Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The visuals of this movie are exactly what you'd want in a star wars movie every thing about this movie looks like it should be in a good Star Wars movie sadly the Last Jedi doesn't feel like a Star Wars film.this movie constantly drags behind making it nothing more than a slow chase across a star system. At the very least there are plenty of plot holes and sub plots that don't make sense in the movie at worst they completely contradict previously established cannon. It's ok space adventure film but it's not fit of bearing the name star wars  ","true":true}
