Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was furious! Saw the 6 p.m IMAX3D yesterday\\, and threw my glasses at the screen at the end! Also\\, I had tickets for a small screen at 11. I was so upset\\, but thank God I went and watched it again\\, because it made me realize that my emotions for Lukes loss were exactly that of anger\\, greed\\, pain\\, and suffering. Ha\\, my own personal path to the dark side. Star Wars is something I truly have loved since childhood\\, it was tough losing Luke. But watching it a second time made me not fear his loss anymore\\, I can't explain it. Everything came together\\, and if I didnt see the Jedi books Rey stole on the Falcon 2nd go around\\, I just don't know. Yoda was so right! He tricks Luke\\, making him believe he burned the books. Luke couldn't burn them\\, he even tried to save them! He was so convinced the Jedi must end\\, he saw only the tree\\, not the forest. I believe he wouldnt have saved the Resistance if he had not shed his attachments. Remember a true Jedi craves not these things. His journey teaches humility through failure. In the end\\, he pulls off the GREATEST Jedi Mind Trick in the history of the galaxy\\, then transcends into the Living Force. Embrace this we must\\, for now the Legend of Luke Skywalker lives forever. mtfbwy.","true":true}
