Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a fan from 77 and read the expanded universe this sucked! George gave Disney all the books and info from expanded universe which had to approve by him before being done. All that was missing from this was Mel Brooks not one lightsaber battle beats the any George did. Ray being able to move a ton of rocks no training yea sure lol. Anakin needed training and was higher count then yoda watch all of Hamills interviews he warned us. ","true":true}
