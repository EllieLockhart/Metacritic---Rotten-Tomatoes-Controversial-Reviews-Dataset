Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing nothing major happened in the movie. Snoke and Kylo Ren are really bad villains they are nothing like the emperor or Darth Vader There is no twist like the empire. I thought the movie would have a big twist but nothing happened. Also Finn was wasted as a character.","true":true}
