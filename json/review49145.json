Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie ever made. SJW politics forced into the movie. Luke's character completely destroyed and all that he accomolished in the provious 3 episode becmes completely irrelevant. All story and character arcs set up in The Force Awakens  now irrelevant. A sidestpry that goes for over 30 minutes with useless characters that goes no where\\, i could go on but you get the point","true":true}
