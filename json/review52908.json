Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An ambitious effort\\, this well-produced film contains a plot element so catastrophically flawed that it basically destroys the entire Star Wars franchise.  In this film\\, Luke Skywalker is a washed-up loser.  This is an unthinkable circumstance\\, and is entirely unrealistic.  It is well-known now that Mark Hamill also objected to this portrayal of Luke\\, but the \\\"brilliant\\\" writers pressed on!  I believe that The Last Jedi will go down in history as the most destructive Gil in movie history.  At the end\\, the lazy risk averse Luke Sywalker (what???  Did I have to write that?) \\\"phones in\\\" his last battle with a well-played and well-developed Kylo Ren.  What a disgrace.  I'm not sure I can ever watch the original films again\\, knowing that Luke ends up giving up on good and giving up on himself after all is said and done.  I will never buy a piece of Star Wars merchandise again\\, and if I find out who\\, specifically\\, is responsible for destroying Luke Skywalker\\, I cannot say what I could be capable of.  How this got past the highly-paid Disney executives is unimaginable.  Many people should lose their jobs over this insane blunder of a film.","true":true}
