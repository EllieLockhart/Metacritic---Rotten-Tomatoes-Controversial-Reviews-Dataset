Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"it's just good my dudes\\n\\ni dont have a big review i just wanted to counter all the blatant review bombing from people who don't like the idea of playing with an audience's expectations and\/or women","true":true}
