Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film just about missed every mark by a titanic mile. Underwhelming\\, bloated\\, and uneven. None of the characters feel like they have much of an arc and the usage of Luke was laughable. Hard pass on this one.","true":true}
