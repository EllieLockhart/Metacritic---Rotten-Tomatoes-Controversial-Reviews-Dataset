Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie broke everything that is loved about Star Wars. Clearly the director doesn't love or understand Star Wars lore. Also\\, building a trilogy without even an outline is a failure from the start. I went in optimistic but came out dissalousioned.","true":true}
