Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed this movie immensely. I wont say that the movie was perfect and there were some parts of it that even I was like \\\"really you pulled that from out of no where. However most of the movie was so enjoyable and well acted that I lost myself and gave squeals of delight that I just don't do at movies anymore so I have to give this a 5 star just for honestly making me happy and not just some mindless action or corny joke every 5 seconds.","true":true}
