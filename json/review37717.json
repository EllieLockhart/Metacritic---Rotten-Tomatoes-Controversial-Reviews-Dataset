Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There was a good bit of action in this movie\\, but it was a complete slap in the face to the story that preceded it.\\n\\nLuke's character was trampled\\, Leia apparently has been watching Mary Poppins and now beings with no experience using the force can instantly wield lightsabers with expert precision.\\n\\nThe way this movie treated the older characters was shameful. It left me with such a bad taste that I'm no longer interested in the franchise. This ends a love that has spanned 41 of my 50 years.","true":true}
