Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is well made\\, funny\\, and truly inspiring. All the people saying they dont like it are just trying to find something to complain about. Sure there are a few flaws\\, but this was the best viewing experience I've had in a movie theater in my life.","true":true}
