Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely terrible movie. Extremely unoriginal and did not feel even remotely like a Star Wars film. It felt more like a Guardians or Thor movie honestly. \\nTerribly unoriginal. The cheap wannabe Spaceball jokes\\, the poor version of the BSG episode 33 minutes\\,  Star Wars chocobos\\, then reversing Empire & Jedi weren't great. \\nWorst Star Wars movie ever!","true":true}
