Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a fan from the old days\\, episodes I\\, II and III are still not in my favorites\\, this episode is now side by side with the Return of the Jedi. They had the courage to surprise us and move the franchise ahead. Great Movie and great cinematic experience (even more if you are a real fan - to be surprised again .. the way we were in the 80's).","true":true}
