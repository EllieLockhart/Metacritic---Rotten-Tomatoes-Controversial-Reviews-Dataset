Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Minus all the Canto Bight sequences\\, this to me would have been 5 stars. People are mainly upset with the arc of Luke Skywalker. That is the divisive tissue of this film. Rian Johnson made a phenomenal Star Wars film in my opinion and took it in a bold new direction. I wish he would have stayed on to write and direct episode 9.","true":true}
