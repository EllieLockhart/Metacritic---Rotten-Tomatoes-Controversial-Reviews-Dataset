Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very self-aware film. Teases mirroring empire\\, then offers new takes and directions. Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher give strong performances that are more than nostalgia. Don't really understand the audience response thus far. ","true":true}
