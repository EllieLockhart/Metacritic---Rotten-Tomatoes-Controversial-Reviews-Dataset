Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Death of Star Wars!!!\\nI have been a fan since I was a child. I have never\\, ever been harsh with any criticisms I may have had with previous films. However the Last Jedi was just too awef to give any sort of pass on. Weak plot\\, wasted characters\\, too much comedy with what was marketed as a darker film\\, not to mention all the forced plot points and one very oddly shot scene. So much wasted potential in this film. I love Star Wars\\, it has essentially been my life. This was NOT Star Wars!!!","true":true}
