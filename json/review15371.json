Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I lost interest and and was disappointed from the moment Luke tossed his lightsaber over his shoulder... It was like: screw this and screw you... and I felt: okej\\, screw this movie. And it was all down hill from there. I was detached. The story didn't glue on me\\, and the current political awareness permeated every action made me feel like it wasn't a Star Wars saga I was experiencing. Zero stars","true":true}
