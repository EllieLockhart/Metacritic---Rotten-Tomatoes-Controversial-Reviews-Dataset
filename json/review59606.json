Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I understand some of the complaints people have with the story but it doesn't deserve the level of hate it's getting\\, if you give this game a rating lower than 7 that is crazy for me but to each their own. This is a great game in every aspect\\, loved the gameplay\\, obviously the graphics and the art design are amazing\\, the music is perfect and the storytelling is so good it made me feel all kind of emotions and the story makes perfect sense after the event that happened at the end of the first one. The characters are great and complex\\, i loved Ellie and\\, after killing Joel i didn't think i would say this but\\, i loved Abby too and they made me feel for her and understand her motivation.The only complaint i have is that the ending is too depressing i would have preferred a more bittersweet ending\\, showing Ellie reuniting with Dina and JJ\\, and even tough i liked the last flashback it left me wanting more\\, like maybe having them play guitar together one last time would have been perfect. So that is why is not a 10\/10 for me but it was really close to it and maybe after experiencing the story a second time knowing what happens it could get there.I am happy that i was able to experience this game. When i replay the first game killing the doctor at the end is going to feel so different.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
