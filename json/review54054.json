Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I created an account just to review this movie. It's so divisive -- the creators took a lot of risks. I had to throw my two-cents in an say that for me\\, those risks absolutely paid off.\\nThis movie serves to subvert everything Star Wars has created in the past. From the very start\\, it tells us that it's not going to go where we think it's going to go. Heck\\, if we actually listen to what the characters are saying\\, the movie TELLS us we have to let go of our preconceptions. That things are not going to be safe\\, and comfortable\\, because this story is subversive. With that in mind\\, I'm not surprised so many people disliked it.\\nHowever\\, I see this movie as an extended metaphor for the star wars universe. Big\\, bad\\, definitive \\\"evil\\\" forces\\, prophecy\\, a clear black and white -- these are tropes of the past. \\nI've had hours of conversation regarding the symbolism in various parts of the film -- suffice to say\\, it's intelligent\\, and challenging. A far cry from most other sci-fi and fantasy nowadays\\, which sadly\\, has been reduced to formulaic\\, uninteresting remakes of past stories.\\nThat's not to say it's a perfect film. There are pacing issues\\, and there is 40 minutes of denouement. But damn\\, is it a step in the right direction. Layered stories\\, diverse characters (the number of strong women in this film made me want to cry!); I really\\, really hope that this sets a precedent for sci-fi and fantasy storytelling in the future!","true":true}
