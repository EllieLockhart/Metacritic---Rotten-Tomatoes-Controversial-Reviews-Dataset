Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The destruction of what Star Wars has stood for\\, basically for the past 40 years. The classic characters of Leia and Luke have been ruined; turning Leia into Mary Poppins and Luke into an old coward\\, who betrays his family and basically the entire galaxy. Questions from 'The Force Awakens' are left either unanswered or simply dismissed. Unfitting humor\\, no consistency\\, characters like Snoke\\, Captain Phasma and the Knights of Ren\\, wasted\\, simply wasted. And at the end\\, Disney revealing their plans for Star Wars: Getting rid of the Skywalker-family Saga and making the concept applicable to any \\\"nobody\\\" character. This way they can repeat the Trilogy-System forever and make another 100 movies. I was afraid when I heard of Disneys purchase of Lucasfilm and now it's all becoming reality: Milking Star Wars till the end.\\n\\nA total disapointment of a movie and an insult to any true Star Wars Fan.","true":true}
