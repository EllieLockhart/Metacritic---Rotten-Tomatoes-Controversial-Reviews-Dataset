Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie did what I did not think it could do\\, make Star Wars feel new and fresh again\\, it was excellent and the better than rogue one. The score was great as always\\, the cinematography and sound design are award worthy and the actors all delivered. All the new characters like Rose Tico and the codebreaker fit organically into the story. The movie takes a direction you wouldn't expect and is satisfying. And while it is 2.5 hours long it was never boring","true":true}
