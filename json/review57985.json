Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"''Where'd you go\\, psycho boy?''\\n''I felt like destroying something beautiful.''\\nFight Club\\n\\nThe audience score and average rating are so rigged I almost pity Rotten Tomatoes to choose to bluemilk Disney that way... Changing your half star rating to one star is not going to change those figures by the way. Someone was brave enough to waste his time and did the maths : the actual audience rating is somewhere between 23 and 24% !\\n\\nNot only this third ''Star Walt'' is the worst Star Wars ever but it is one of the worst movies I have seen : ludicrous scenario\\, shallow characterisation\\, bad writting\\, worse acting...\\nJedi master maRey Sue\\nWhining Emo Ren\\nJake Skywalker with ptsd milking Kathleen Kennedy\\nSupreme looser Snoke\\nFat asian Jar Jar\\nCarrie Poppins\\nRun Forrest Finn\\nVegan Chewbacca\\nOne-droid-army BB8\\nSpace penguins\\n... all this crap dipped in crypto-marxist postmodernist SJW diarrhea and anticapitalist propaganda (seriously ! Disney !!? DI$$$NEY !!!?).\\n\\nWhen leaving the theatre\\, I actually couldn't help to think about the end scene of Full Metal Jacket\\, when the marines\\, leaving the city in flames\\, ironically sing the Mickey Mouse Club march : ''Who's the leader of the Club that's made for you and me? M-I-C-K-E-Y-M-O-U-S-E ! Mickey Mouse\\, Mickey Mouse !''\\n\\nIf you sincerely liked this ''movie''\\, maybe you should consider the possibility that you are a cinema illiterate\\, easily thrilled by one dimensional superheroes\\, ridiculous costumes\\, brainless humor\\, flashy effects and loud sounds.\\n\\nAnyway\\, I wish I had never witnessed this autodafe and we've lost any and all  interest in more Star WALT movies... and merchandise ! Our money will go where the talent is !","true":true}
