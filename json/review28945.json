Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really enjoyed episode 8 in the Star Wars saga. While I\u0092m the first to admit it dragged a bit in the middle of the movie it\u0092s to be expected in a 2.5 hour film. I found the character development and interplay between Rey\\, Luke\\, and Kylo to be very enjoyable and there were several shocking twists and turns. Fabulous movie and look forward to episode 9 and the Hans solo movie!","true":true}
