Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So much hate from Star Wars fan\\, I saw the movie last night\\, watched a few Star Wars Explained videos\\, and some others thoughts\\, not that I cared much what other people think\\, but was trying to figure out why they hated it so much.  Some of it was how Luke was protrayed\\, others about Snokes death\\, others mad about a chase in space.  However\\, i went back and looked at these peoples complaints about Force Awakens as well\\, and you have to realise\\, this is a group of middle-aged folks who have nothing else to look forward to.  This movie was awesome\\, real\\, and i dont care what anyone else says made me love Luke Skywalker even more.  What's more than that\\, i felt Rey's passion to be something\\, to actually matter for once and do something about it\\, tired of thinking that a wait on Jakku would be her destiny.  What I missed from the movie?  Some details on the Knights of Ren\\, no biggie.  Phasma could have done more\\, but holy crap\\, there wasn't enough to make me bash this movie the way so many cry-babies are.  Grow up\\, is my advice to you\\, or earn 5.2 billion dollars and man up and buy LucasFilm and make the movie you want...oh you cant?  So shut up.","true":true}
