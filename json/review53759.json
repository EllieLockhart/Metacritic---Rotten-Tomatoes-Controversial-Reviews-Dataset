Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Grade: A\\nI think this film is very misunderstood. I think fans were expecting something explosive and action packed along with really crazy plots that were theorized by fans for two years ...but what I liked is that it wasn't action packed... and was very different. It may have been a bit long but really it took the time to explain basically what the hell is going on!!! It did that by also bringing new life instead of just being so repetitive. Johnson brought back originality to Star Wars. I think fans need to understand that. This was a way to truly fix these broken characters\\, to take a breather and realize where they are at. The way he showcases the force is so different and honestly very detailed and I love that. This film was not just about to entertain but to connect with people like never before and bring them to new places. I respect his vision.","true":true}
