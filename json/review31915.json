Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILER FREE\\nI am dissappointed. Great fight scenes\\, a good plot but horribly implemented at the important parts. We learn absolutely nothing new about Snoke and key sequences are overshadowed by political correctness or pure childishness (casino scene). I am not going to see episode 9 at the cinema because of some major plotholes. It is okay to have them in the first movie\\, and teasing for the next one is okay\\, too\\, but this was just to much. 2 Stars because of the action\\, so transformers level. Cannot understand the good ratings\\, critics must be bought or simply gotten dull. The worst part is not the movie itself\\, but that the makers seemed to have a clear picture of what it should have looked like and crippled it down because of Disney-moneymaking-guidelines. Phantom Menace over this everyday.","true":true}
