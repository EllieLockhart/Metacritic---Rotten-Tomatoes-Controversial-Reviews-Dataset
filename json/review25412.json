Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nonspecific Spoilers: The movie tells you what it\u2019s doing through Kylo Ren\u2014 burning up the past\\, the old tropes and formula of the earlier films\\, subverting mythology. You can hate that but it does do that effectively. To me\\, Disney said with TFA\\, \u201cHey look we can do Star Wars a la a retro mashup.\u201d With TLJ\\, it said\\, \u201cBut we\u2019re not going there.\u201d And with Ep. 9\\, \u201cThis is where we\u2019re going.\u201d","true":true}
