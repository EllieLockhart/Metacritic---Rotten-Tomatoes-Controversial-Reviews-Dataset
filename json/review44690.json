Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To true STAR WARS lovers\\, this movie is RICH. \\nDELICIOUS! \\nIt's always been about the story...the mythology. Yes\\, the film making and special effects are always state of the art and flawless.\\nBut those of us who know and follow the story could care less about that. \\n\\nTHE LAST JEDI opens the continuing saga up  much in the same as Episode V...The Empire Strikes Back. \\nIt Literally sells a half a Billion dollars worth of tickets for Episode IX. \\n\\nGREAT MOVIE.","true":true}
