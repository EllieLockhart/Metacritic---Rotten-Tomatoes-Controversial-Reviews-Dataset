Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie definitely took everything you were expecting to happen with the trilogy and flipped it upside down. Rian Johnson took a great risk with where he decided to take the series\\, and I believe it turned into a good movie. This definitely has a vibe that is very different than any previous Star Wars movie. I personally do wish Luke was portrayed a little differently\\, maybe a little more like the Luke of the original trilogy\\, thought I absolutely LOVE his sass. But this movie kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time\\, extremely excited for what was going to happen next. \\nNow\\, this movie does leave a few questions unanswered\\, but these are questions that can be answered in episode IX.\\nSPOILERS:\\nLuke dies at the very end\\, if you haven't seen or heard that already. I wish he didn't\\, at least not with the timing that he did. However\\, I don't believe he's done yet. Force ghosts are a thing. I'm excited to see how Episode IX resolves this trilogy.","true":true}
