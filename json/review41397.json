Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is an affront to anyone who knows even very little about Star Wars. Aside from the great cinematography\\, this movie is not worth seeing. Rian Johnson singlehandedly ruined a 30yr legacy in just two hours. If you LOVE Star Wars\\, please DO NOT see this film. ","true":true}
