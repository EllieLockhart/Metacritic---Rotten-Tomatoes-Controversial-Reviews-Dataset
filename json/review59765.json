We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Honestly\\, you know what you did wrong Naughty Dog.\rYou don't need me to say how you **** up.\rYou know what you did\\, you had your chance.\rJoel is dead.\rEllie's relationship gets thrown down the gutter.\rShe doesn't find true love and doesn't get her revenge because she imagines Joel playing a guitar.\rWhich I guess is supposed to mean \\\"He doesn't want you to kill her\\\"\rBut people who played the last game know damn well if Ellie died Joel would burn forests and shatter mountains to find the bastard that killed Ellie just to perform every Mortal Kombat Finisher imaginable on them.\r\rPeople are now trying to discredit these reviews as review bombers who haven't played the full 25-30 game experience and thus can't criticize the game but that is **** personified. If the game kills off a main character in the first hour\\, and you give it another 4 hours to get good\\, why would you spend the next 20-25 hours playing the game if you don't like it. How many chances are you required to give a game before your review is seen as valid.\rThey're also saying this is because of the \\\"lgbt and trans characters in the game\\\" but we've been fine with those characters every since that DLC of the first game came out. Also THEY are the ones that ended the only lgbt relationship in the damn game\\, not me. I would've prefered at the very least for Ellie to find love or someone to comfort her after the game's ending other than a **** guitar. But THEY are the ones that ruined that. Don't say the reviewer hate lgbt characters when the developers don't seem to want those relationships in the game either.\r\rDon't buy the game. The entirety of the cutscenes are on youtube and the gameplay isn't that much diferent from the last game. If you're so desperate for gameplay then play the last game or play a better one. Because otherwise if you're a fan of the series then the story isn't for you.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
