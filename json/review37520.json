Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are\\, undoubtedly\\, some issues with this movie\\, but that does little to take away from the fact that it is a fantastic film. Being an entry into the Star Wars universe comes with expectations that are very difficult to live up to. And\\, other than a few questionable twists\\, and a the fact that it's about 20 minutes too long\\, this is an amazing feat of film making. Overall I's give The Last Jedi a 4 out of 5 and a 7.5 out of 10. Bring on 'Solo'!","true":true}
