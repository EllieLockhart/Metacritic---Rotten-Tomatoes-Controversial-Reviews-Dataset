Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Takes a while to get going (probably why it\u0092s 2hrs 30mins long) but when it does your treated to a movie with emotionally heft\\, a small dose of humour and\\, of course\\, thrills and spills. Interested to know where it\u0092s going next","true":true}
