But everything he promised\\, he fulfills with wisdom and still being better than expected\\, such as: Beautiful graphics and full of details\\, as well as the effect of blood\\, animations\\, footprints in the mud\\, water\\, facial expressions\\, in the setting (giving the impression that this has really been abandoned for years). His story\\, which is actually very good\\, is also courageous\\, giving a great twist at the end\\, giving several life lessons and also approaching the point of view of some characters since in the game we control more than one character. It also brings striking scenes and emotions with very impactful deaths. Another thing I liked was that the game got bloodier and more realistic\\, addressing heavy topics (such as pregnancy\\, revenge\\, grief\\, loss and insanity). Speaking of gameplay\\, it is not very different from the first one and as I said up there \\\"it is not revolutionary\\\"\\, but it still has some small improvements. Another positive point is that the places were more open\\, with stores with intensity that can help you. Containing parallel stories that even connect with events. The only thing that took some of my immersion out of the game was the artificial intelligence that is still kind of stupid compared to the first but that's it Besides\\, the game is incredible and it was one of the best experiences I've ever had in the gaming world.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
