Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was ready to enjoy the movie\\, the next chapter of my favorite movies series.  Unfortunately\\, a bad plot\\, unlikable characters\\, and poorly executed humor was delivered.  Honestly\\, by the end of this mess\\, I'm pulling for the bad guys.  I was hoping Mark Hamill was exaggerating with his description of the wasted opportunity.  He wasn't.  It's bad\\, really really bad.","true":true}
