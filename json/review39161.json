Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This Episode has too much talking and not much of a light saber action! Last Episode I seen that is good was the Revenge of the Sith because of better actors and actress. Natalie Portman and Hayden C. was way better!!! John and Daisy sucks!!! Only Adam Driver was the only new actor was good role!! And that\u2019s the Facts!! ","true":true}
