Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I'm not going to leave any spoilers\\, so anyone who sees this doesn't get any form of depression.So\\, you liked the Last of Us huh... Who didn't. So to put it bluntly\\, STAY AWAY FROM THE GAME OR ANYTHING RELATED TO THE PLOT. It's bad\\, you really don't want to know what happens.

They've somehow made one of the worst sequels in all media I've seen\\, out of one of the best games ever. I'm not gonna hint what happens\\, but there is a very painful moment that happens near the beginning of the game. If you loved the first game\\, it'll definitely put a sour taste in your mouth for months. That's all I'm gonna say about that\\, I just really don't want to think about it. Like seriously\\, what were the writers thinking. You'd have to be brain dead to think people would be fine with it.Now the characters. I never had an issue with the new Ellie really\\, I know many other people did but other than her issue with a bigot sandwich\\, her agenda wasn't too eye rolling for me. But all the new characters are throw aways. None of them were well written\\, or at least written to be enjoyable to play as or watch.I can't really say anything else without spoiling stuff\\, just don't play this game. The atmosphere is amazing\\, the combat is fun and usually doesn't get stale which is why this isn't a 1 out of 10. But if you're a fan of the first game\\, I beg you not to even look at this game. It'll ruin your faith in humanity\\, and not for the right reasons like Come and See.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
