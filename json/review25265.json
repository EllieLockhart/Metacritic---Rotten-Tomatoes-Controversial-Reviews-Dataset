Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"- No characters\/ development\\n- Overly long\\n- Boring\\n- Themes contradicted incessantly.\\nIt's bad\\, does nothing to really advance any story\\, character or plot and will probably be made an utterly redundant and pointless film between 7 and 9.","true":true}
