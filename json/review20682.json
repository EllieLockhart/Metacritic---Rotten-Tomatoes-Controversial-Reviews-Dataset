Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've watched Star   since I could walk and this movie was not Star Wars in any sense no lore no addition to the franchise just an agenda to please people who will watch the movie once  and a disregard to the true fans who love the series I'm not going to watch the 9th one witch is tuff for me cuzz I love the series but when Luke the strongest Jedi the son of the man who was literally born by the force Gets beat by ANYONE who has no practice with the force in a duel that's when I draw the line end rant","true":true}
