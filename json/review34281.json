Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The 8th  installment of the Star Wars saga(excluding Rogue One\\, The Clone Wars movie\\, the Ewok movies & the holiday special) showed a different perspective from it's predecessors. Great new additions from an already great cast\\, great writing and directing from Rian Johnson and his co-writers and a perfect farewell to the amazing Carrie Fisher(even though unused shots of Leia will be used in Episode 9).The plot took an unexpected and dark turn(which did upset many fans) but the unorthodox turn was necessary even if many people thought it was not. Most critics actually thought the movie was really good but most fans hated it\\, my own opinion\\, I have to side with the critics\\, this was a really good film.","true":true}
