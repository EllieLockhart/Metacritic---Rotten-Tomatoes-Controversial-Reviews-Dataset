Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie destroy Star Wars franchise... Rose is at level of Jar Jar... Bombers? Casino Planet? Dull not wanted women characters? Plotholes\\, dull characters... disappointment after disappointment from the beginning of the movie... Worst spent money in last months... Not watch the nine episode. Star Wars is dead...","true":true}
