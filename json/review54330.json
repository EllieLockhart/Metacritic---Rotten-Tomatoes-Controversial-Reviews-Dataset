Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a Star Wars fan since the first film opened in theatres in 1977 and I take issue with the glowing reviews of the critics over this latest Star Wars installment\\, \\\"The Last Jedi\\\". \\n\\nI loved The Force Awakens and actors like Boyega\\, Isaac\\, Ridley and Driver have great potential. But\\, given the disparity between the ratings of the \\\"professionals\\\" and the ratings (and the feelings) of the viewing audience one has to wonder whether these critics haven't been given their thirty pieces of silver from Disney to write inflated reviews. A pox on all their houses.\\n\\nNo one I know who saw The Last Jedi liked it\\, no disrespect intended to the actors or the technical staff. It doesn't have a Star Wars soul. Its story line is incoherent\\, it doesn't follow on from The Force Awakens and it is disrespectful to all that came before. \\n\\nThis will be remembered as the anti-Star Wars film.\\n\\nI have no issue with the new kid on the block taking Star Wars in a different direction and introducing new characters but I don't like the revisionism. Johnson is corrupting the past. Leave the past alone it doesn't belong to Disney. People\\, like me\\, are angry with this film for good reason.\\n\\nI won't point out all the defects in this dog's breakfast of a film\\, you can see them for yourself when you go see it\\, but one thing that truly bothers me is the diminishment of iconic characters like Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker.\\n\\nLeia has been reduced to a bimbo who utters vulgarities like \\\"get your head out of your cockpit\\\" to Poe Dameron the great fighter pilot. In another scene she slaps his face ostensibly because he is a man and all men need to be put in their place. I found this kind of behaviour agenda driven and out of character for Leia and for the film.\\n\\nWhat they did to the character of Luke Skywalker was worse and unforgivable. Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy and whoever else was involved in creating this lesser film threw Skywalker under the bus.\\n\\nIt beggars belief that the Luke Skywalker in this film is the same Luke Skywalker who turned Darth Vader from the Dark Side and helped bring down the Empire. Luke Skywalker\\, as we've all known for the last forty years\\, is a selfless hero who would gladly sacrifice himself for his friends and for what is right and good.\\n\\nThe way Johnson has revised and finished off the Skywalker character is complete and utter bullshit and totally unbelievable. I have great respect for Mark Hamill and I'm sorry Disney did this to him\\, he deserved better. Disney has lost the goodwill of many Star Wars fans and for good reason.\\n\\nFolks\\, please go see this movie for yourself and come back here and share your honest opinion with the rest of us. Let's see if you agree with the critics that this is a 91% fresh film or if you think something else is going on here.","true":true}
