Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Garbage. This movie destroys the franchise.  I hate Rian Johnson more than Jar Jar Binks.  \\nFirst they have a main character who basically is off the streets and has nothing to do with anyone from the first six films.  Gee\\, I can't wait until the next Game of Thrones book that gets introduced and she's the daughter of a blacksmith and she'll have more power than everyone than the previous five books and all the focus will be on her.\\nWe have a bunch of new character who we're supposed to care about when they die\\, and characters that have been featured for six movies die off screen. Purple haired women and fat asians?  They got some in TLJ. Too much to complain about.  Moral of the story is this movie sucks.","true":true}
