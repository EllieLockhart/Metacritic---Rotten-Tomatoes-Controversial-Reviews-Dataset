Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"half the movie was unnecesarry and prescious plot time could have been used to develope characters more instead of killing them off almost right away. that is the short and sweet review. in all the last Jedi was\\, in the eyes of a long-time fan\\, was a giant mess and sucked. If you are a star wars fan go see it for yourself and have your own opinion. all i know is many ithers didn't like how this installment of the new trilogy turned out. Many old characters like Luke didnt actually feel like he was Luke Skywalker just mark hamill playing the character that wasnt true to his personality from the old movies at all. If Episode VIII could be redone then it most definitely should be redone.","true":true}
