Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was not impressed with TFA\\, but I held onto the hope that it could be redeemed by TLJ and the continuing saga. Now that hope is gone and not even Princess Leia could convince me otherwise. The worst thing about this movie is that it made me not want to see any new Star Wars films\\, and that is a very depressing feeling for a life-long fan.","true":true}
