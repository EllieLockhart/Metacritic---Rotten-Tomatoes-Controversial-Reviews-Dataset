Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had to stop watching this movie 3 times.  I'm a lifelong star wars fan and was looking forward to sharing the franchise with my kids.... congratulations you have destroyed it.  I just don't understand how Hollywood has to push this political agenda on everyone.  Well\\, you reap what you sow\\, I will not be seeing an future movies\\, buying any merc. and I will not be taking my kids to Disney or sharing buying any movies post 2003.  Way to go destroying your core demographic... and for what?  Hangout with your richie friends in hollywood? Here is an idea\\, some production company should start making real movies\\,with real plots and characters that make sense.  That represent everyone\\, not just identity politics demographics.","true":true}
