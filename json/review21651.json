Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just a bit disappointing.  I'm just now sure why the critics are loving this.  There are some interesting things happening visually but it has a real \\\"written by committee\\\" feel to it.  The side stories just seem tacked on and really predictable.  There never feels like there are any stakes.  The humor falls flat.  Worst of all\\, the movie pretty much ends right back where it starts.  Nothing of import changes.  I'll bet if future generations just skipped this movie\\, it wouldn't make much of a difference in the overall narrative.","true":true}
