Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"absolutely terrible movie. Would give it -10 stars if I could. Important plot points are thrown away for cheap laughs\\, awkward and uninteresting side story and romance arc\\, too many plot holes to take seriously.\\n\\nI would highly suggest you sign this petition\\n https:\/\/www.change.org\/p\/the-walt-disney-company-have-disney-strike-star-wars-episode-viii-from-the-official-canon","true":true}
