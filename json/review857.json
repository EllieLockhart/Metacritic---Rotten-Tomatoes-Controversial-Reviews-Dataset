Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An fairly decent Star Wars film\\, with twists and turns and fantastic new creatures. But with an ending that left me stabbed through my fandom heart like Han\u2019s betrayal in Episode 7. The whole film builds to this triumphant moment of Luke where we all cheered\\, only to have it mercilessly ripped away from us as he meets a pointless and unceremonious end. I think Disney owes us all an apology for the most disrespectful way in which they handled the end of Luke Skywalker. I will not be buying advance tickets to anymore Star Wars films because of the how this ended. Shame on Disney for this betrayal of the fandom and their disrespect of one of the most beloved characters in human fictional history. ","true":true}
