Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"No one hates Star Wars more than Star Wars fans.\\\"\\n\\n\\nThis quotes rings true\\, with the amount of hate coming from the fan base. This film brings Star Wars closer to its original trilogy roots\\, but then adds a enough twists to make it unique. It adds new layers to new and old characters alike. While brining back the humor that the original trilogy had in spades\\, while still passing the torch to a new generation. \\n\\nI recommend seeing it with an open mind\\, and give it at chance before letting the hate flow through you.","true":true}
