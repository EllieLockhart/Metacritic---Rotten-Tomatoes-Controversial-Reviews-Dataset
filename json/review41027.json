{"101487":183848,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-03","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie fell short in soo many key ways. Every single mystery left over by The Force Awakens was answered with sloppy writing. Finn was a side character left to go on unnecessary journey's with this new \\\"Rose\\\" character. Both were left as underdeveloped messes. Luke's portrayal was so poorly done. So many unnecessary scenes that should have replaced by time to explain the dynamic between Kylo and Luke and\/or Kylo and Snoke. This was the opportunity to develop Kylo Ren as the key antogonist of this story and it failed. Killing off Luke was also a crucial mistake that ended up hurting Kylo's character rather than strengthening it. Leia's saga could have easily been ended in space given that Fisher died irl. This would give more time to go into something interesting under Kylo's character such as the Knights of Ren.\\n\\nWarning: spoilers ahead!\\n\\nTHE BAD:\\n\\nThe movie starts at the exact moment The Force Awakens left off. No time has passed since the Episode VII. Rey is holding out the lightsaber to Luke\\, and we see what happens next in one of the first scenes in The Last Jedi.\\nSo that means\\, all of a sudden the New Republic-turned-Resistance is down to just a few ships?! They were much more significant force in TFA. The First Order got too powerful too fast for the sake of this movie. \\nAnd there's no explanation on the origins of the First Order. It would have been much more interesting if the two sides were a bit more evenly matched and strategized like chess pieces\\, and asked questions like\\, who is on whose side?\\n Who will double-cross each other? Who will turn to the dark side\\, etc.?\\n\\nThe slow\\, hours-long space chase. The Resistance cruiser must have had the strongest shields in the galaxy\\, because the First Order kept firing on it the whole time\\, constantly pummeling them with heavy lasers for like 18 HOURS. \\nIn hot pursuit\\, there was Snoke's huge flagship and a convoy of Star Destroyers! Why didn't some of those First Order ships just go to light speed to travel IN FRONT of the Resistance cruiser and FLANK it? \\nTrap it with nowhere to go. Instead\\, we have this dumb\\, slow chase just to bring a false sense of peril in the movie. Outside of Rey's journey\\, THIS IS THE WHOLE PLOT OF THE MOVIE; \\nThe First Order is flying behind the Resistance ships\\, WAITING FOR THEM TO RUN OUT OF GAS.\\n\\nLeia Poppins flying through space. Suddenly all of the Jar Jar Binks scenes from the prequels don't look so bad.\\n\\nNo explanation on who Snoke is. He's just another disfigured dark side of the force guy who's a copycat of Emperor Palpatine.\\n\\nWhy wasn't the Millennium Falcon used to evacuate the Resistance people during the slow chase? It just dropped Rey off to see Kylo and Snoke and then...Chewie just flew off? I said out loud in the theatre\\, \\\"why did he just fly off...?\\\" \\nThe Falcon was still the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy. It could have outrun the First Order ships in hyperspace. The Falcon was used at the very end for this same purpose\\, but this solution was ignored earlier in The Last Jedi \\nbecause the movie would have ended an hour earlier.\\n\\nThe Canto Bight (casino planet) sequence. TOTALLY unnecessary. The Finn and Rose story...ugh...who cares? Oh\\, let's also have some animal cruelty subplot thrown in there and crammed down our throats. \\nAnd the whole Benicio Del Toro character\/plot. (Why has his safe-cracker character laying around in his cell with a key the entire time until Finn and Rose were thrown in the cell with him? What was he waiting for? \\nNothing. Actually\\, he was just waiting for the writers to tell him what to do next. Nice.) The whole sub-plot of finding a \\\"safe-cracker\\\" was useless and pointless and went nowhere. \\nIt was just something for the Finn character to do to have 30 minutes of screen time. And the casino scenes...they looked too much like earth; just throw a few aliens in any modern casino here on earth and film it there.\\n\\nWhy didn't Vice Admiral Holdo (the Laura Dern character) share her plans with the rest of the crew? It would have prevented the Poe mutiny\\, and then Finn and Rose would have known that their mission subplot was completely unnecessary. \\nIn fact\\, it would have potentially saved hundreds (thousands?) of lives as Benicio Del Toro\\, the reward for their sidequest\\, wouldn't have been in a position to tell the First Order about the escaping transport vessels General Leia \\nhad bet the house on all along. Such sloppy writing by Rian Johnson.\\n\\nThe puppet Yoda was distracting. Why on earth can't Lucasfilm make a Yoda look consistent in two Star Wars movies in a row? (Well\\, they did with Empire and ROTJ\\, but not since.) With all of the technical tools at their disposal\\, \\nadvanced CGI and hundreds of millions of dollars to throw at recreating him\\, this could easily be done by the filmmakers. Yoda looked so \\\"bubble-like\\\" and weird-looking\\, like they based his puppet around the way he looks in the cartoons.\\n\\nIn The Last Jedi\\, Luke just wanted to go to the island planet\\, leave everyone else behind\\, become a grumpy old man and die...the problem is\\, it was one of the MAJOR PLOT POINTS in The Force Awakens that Luke previously hid detailed maps\\n inside of R2-D2 (and the other part was in BB-8) so that people could find him. EVERYONE was wanting to know where Luke was\\, especially Kylo Ren. But I guess now all of that has been forgotten about. Yep. Makes sense.\\n\\nWhy did C3PO have a red arm in TFA\\, but not here? As I said earlier\\, this took place directly after the previous movie.\\n\\nOn the topic of Snoke... I realize that Emperor Palpatine didn't have much of a backstory in the Original Trilogy. I get it. We don't need volumes of material on Snoke\\, either. But ANH\\, ESB\\, and ROTJ established that the bad guys were\\n the Empire\\, and what do you have as a leader in an Empire? An Emperor. Not a whole lot more had to be said. Palpatine was the main baddie. But after ROTJ\\, you had a \\\"happily ever after\\\" where the good guys had won. \\nThen\\, what happened in those thirty years that made the First Order and Snoke even more powerful than the original Empire and made their rise to dominance so ridiculously fast? Who was Snoke? Where did he come from? \\nHow did he get so powerful and proficient in the Dark Side of the Force? What was he doing during the time frame in the original trilogy? You see\\, Star Wars as a whole is a SERIAL. The stories interconnect and tell a larger story. \\nThey all affect each other. Places\\, people and events in one film have a bearing on other movies. How did they go from \\\"happily ever after\\\" to nearly wiping out the entire Resistance so quickly?\\n\\nThe Force Awakens teased us with intriguing questions and speculations. Why was Rey able to pilot the Millennium Falcon so well? Why did Luke's\/Anakin's lightsaber \\\"call out\\\" to her? Speaking of that\\, how did Maz Kenatta even retrieve \\nLuke's lightsaber that he lost in Cloud City 30 years ago? What did Rey's vision mean? Why did she see so many scenes from Luke's life in it? Why did Obi Wan speak to her in that vision? Might the identity of Rey's parents hold some \\nof the answers? We waited two years to find out. And...we got nothing. None of the questions were answered or addressed\\, except her parents\\, which was really a non-answer. Why bother showing them in the vision? It was an answer that \\nRian Johnson could have replied with\\, \\\"I'm not playing this game. I don't even like Star Wars. Take your mythology and shove it.\\\"\\n\\nUgh...Wasted characters. The Force Awakens built up the new Rebel\/Resistance characters well\\, Po & Finn as great friends\\, Rey & Finn as friends and potential love interests... Rey... Who is she? Where is Luke... Why is he in hiding?\\n The Last Jedi quickly takes all of these questions and gives them the same boring answer...that NONE of it really matters. Chewie and Artoo were criminally underused in the movie; they were practically extras (they got as much screen \\ntime as those frog costumed creatures on Luke's island). Who are the Knights of Ren? Oh\\, nevermind\\, let's just drop it and everything else. More sloppy writing.\\n\\nAt the battle at the end\\, Finn was going to make the ultimate sacrifice and fly into the giant cannon to put it out of commission\\, and then...Rose just knocks him out of the way to save him to just give him a kiss? WHAT?? She says \\nsomething like\\, \\\"you win by saving those who you love.\\\" Um\\, no\\, you win by destroying the enemy! Finn had a chance\\, and she blew it. It reminds me of a quote by General Patton: \\\"The object of war is not to die for your country\\, \\nbut to make the other bastard die for his.\\\" It also undercut the story arc for Finn's character. He\\, near the beginning of the movie\\, was ready to sneak out in the escape pod before Rose stopped him. Fast forward to the final battle\\, \\nand Finn supposedly grew as a character\\, and was ready to make the ultimate sacrifice\\, kill the First Order\\, and die for the rebels instead of running away and...she prevented that. Just pointless and stupid.\\n\\nThere was no real cliffhanger or any hanging plots leading into the next movie that make me want to see it. The Resistance is too small (what are they\\, like 15 people at this point?) and in too much of a low point to realistically \\nbuilt back up in one movie's time to defeat the First Order\\, who at this point is too powerful.\\n\\nLuke is now dead. Carrie Fisher is dead (no Leia in the next movie\\, as Disney has stated that they're not going to use real footage or a CGI Leia in the next one). Snoke is dead. There are about fifteen \\\"good guys\\\" left and \\n(as stated in the film)\\, their allies in the Outer Rim territories don't care about them any more. The only real\\, halfway-interesting question remaining is\\, what will happen in the relationship between Kylo and Rey?\\n\\nTHE GOOD:\\n\\nThe Kylo\/Rey interactions. This was probably the only good thing that has been added to the mythos of the Force since the the tale of Darth Plagueis in Revenge of the Sith.\\n\\nSpeaking of that\\, Adam Driver was EXCELLENT as Kylo Ren. \\n\\nMark Hamill turned in a heavy\\, emotional performance\\, even though the Luke Skywalker character got crapped on. The twin sunset scene right before Luke died was cool. Bookends\\, so to speak\\, of his hero's journey.\\n\\nThe fact that there were not a lot of references to other movies and the hit-you-over-the-head fan service that bogged down The Force Awakens and Rogue One.\\n\\nArtoo projecting the Princess Leia hologram from A New Hope. This callback actually made sense!\\n\\nThe visual effects. But since effects houses can pretty much do anything\\, is it even something to point out anymore here in 2017?\\n\\nYoda. I'm glad he was back\\, and it was great to hear Frank Oz doing his voice once again. But to be honest\\, I didn't hear half of his dialog because I was so distracted that he looked so weird.\\n\\nIN CONCLUSION:\\n\\nI would have settled for silly\\, childish slapstick like in The Phantom Menace. Or terrible dialogue and acting like in Attack of the Clones. The Last Jedi has done something far worse than the prequels did: it made me not \\ncare about the characters or Star Wars any more. I'm just done.","true":true}
