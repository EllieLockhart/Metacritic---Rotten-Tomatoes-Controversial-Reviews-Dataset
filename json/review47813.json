{"101487":196274,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-31","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where JJ Abrams \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" gave us with little cookie crumbs and left us wanting more\\, Rian Johnson's \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" made us consider taking a break from cookies for a while.\\n\\nDisclaimer: This review contains some spoilers. I have seen this movie 2x\\, and I am an avid Star Wars fan. The 2nd viewing I went to a theater that served alcohol\\, and this luxury greatly improved the movie watching experience.\\n\\nPositives: This movie has all the glitz and glam you've come to expect from the Disney-Lucas backed trilogy. With beautiful sets\\, fantastical creatures\\, action packed battle scenes (other reviewers believe that the Kylo-Ren\/Rey battle against Snoke's Praetorian guard was exceptional)\\, scenes shot in Ireland\\, and a CGI Carrie Fisher\\, the only low budget thing about this movie was a re-animated puppet Yoda. This blockbuster is worth seeing based on production value alone.\\n\\nPoe's character receives some much needed character development. A large portion of the film is entirely devoted to him learning from his initial mistake in the beginning scene. By the end of the film\\, he apparently elevates his wisdom\\, so if\/when the next director has him lead the rebellion\\, after they presumably kill off Ms. Fisher in the third installment\\, he'll be ready. \\n\\nKelly Marie Tran adds to the diversity of the new Star Wars franchise as an asian female playing a prominent role\\, Rose Tico\\, that is neither damsel in distress nor riffing off of stereotyped caricatures. As an actress she is enthusiastic and makes use of her poorly written role.\\n\\nAdam Driver is a good actor. There's one scene where our goofy HBO series \\\"Girls\\\" boyfriend turns into hunky evil villain refusing to put on a shirt while he mind melds with Rey. Alas\\, our hunky evil villain continues to confront whether he is good or evil and Rian Johnson does a good job of incorporating\/continuing this internal conflict into his installment. \\n\\nNegatives: I watched this movie the first time with a friend who rightfully pointed out after the movie that the central plot is actually recycled from the revamped Battlestar Galactica's pilot episode \\\"33\\\" (The human fleet can't escape the Cylons after traveling through warp speed\/hyperspace). Rian Johnson admits he borrowed from Battlestar Galactica\\, there are definitely major variations\\, and lots of movies employ chase scenes. Yet a two and a half hour chase movie is too long and cuts in and out too many times to maintain our fickle millennial attention spans. The beauty of the low-budget Battlestar Galactica episode is that its only 40 minutes. Don't get me wrong: I came into this movie with the enthusiasm of any Star Wars nut\\, wholeheartedly ready to forgive clunky Lucas dialogue (see \\\"Padme I don't like sand\\\") and wearing an adult diaper so that I don't miss any of it (kidding\\, but am I?). This movie is long though\\, and it feels like it. Your kidneys will thank you if you use the RunPee app.\\n\\nUNDERDEVELOPED. I know I said Poe received some much needed character development\\, but honestly there was nothing humanistic about it. Sure we see that Poe makes mistakes like the rest of us that end up killing hundreds of his companions\\, but what about his back story? What about the teasers we saw in interviews that he might be the first openly gay Star Wars characters? Why does Poe crack so many bad jokes allaying the suspense of the moment? (Not in the Hans Solo debonair way either)\\n\\nThis young and enthusiastic cast doesn't get a chance in Rian Johnson's Star Wars to build off of JJ Abram's plausible characters. Finn and Rose Tico's subplot is utterly pointless. Sure there is world building (a casino world where war profiteers indulge in a PG hedonistic fashion)\\, Rose shows compassion for the fathiers (alien horses)\\, and I guess we now have to indulge in a romance between Finn and Rose (I so wanted Finn and Rey to work :()\\, but for the most part their subplot does not add to the development of the plot at all. Their characters feel entirely situational without the direction of individual personalities (Finn does continue his switching between comic buffoonery and courageous hero space janitor the entire movie). At one point you're even worried Finn is going to kamikaze his way out of the franchise (we love you John Boyega please don't do that). \\n\\nRey has her moments\\, as she navigates her new powers and the utterly bizarre world she's been thrust into\\, but Mark Hamill is bad at acting so I expected their screen time to be limited in content. We also don't get any information about why she was left on Jakku or who left her their. She is becoming a majorly awesome butt kicking jedi though\\, so there is that.\\n\\nThe most underdeveloped parts to me are the little goodies JJ Abrams left us with that were thrown away. Remember the scene where Kylo Ren is leaving Luke's Jedi academy with a cohort of other evil Jedis? Well Rian Johnson doesn't\\, we don't hear anything about this cohort unless they're meant to be Snoke's Praetorian guard\\, which Kylo and Rey promptly slaughter. Oh yea and Snoke? The humanoid life form with a face full of cavities\\, who has significant command over the force\\, and apparently has lived for generations - what's his deal? How did he take Kylo Ren under his wing? Rian Johnson cares not\\, and kills Snoke without any explanation as to who or what this being really is. I guess this leaves room for the idea that Kylo Ren was nursing an evil force inside him long before Snoke\\, but honestly I felt like the audience was cheated. \\n\\nSummary: The movie is much like this review\\, clunky and all over the place with little uniformity. Definitely go see it and decide for yourself. The movie is 100% watchable.\\n\\nWill I see it 7 times like I've seen the other Star Wars films? Probably\\, but you definitely shouldn't.\\n\\nMay the force be with you.","true":true}
