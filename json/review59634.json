Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"If this had been multiplayer only I would have scored it much higher.  Visually the game is gorgeous\\, I loved the gameplay from the first game and this one is very similar. I don't agree with some that it needs to evolve so much when you have dozens of first person shooters that use the same engines and don't feel very different to each other\\, there was only one Last of Us.  If you enjoyed the gameplay mechanics from the first one there's no reason you wont enjoy this one too\\, I personally love the gameplay mechanics.Unfortunately its impossible to play it and avoid the story\\, and if you are also a big fan of the first one you will quite likely be hugely disappointed by the direction they take in the second one.  It feels very jolting which although I'm sure was their intention\\, it just takes too much away from the first one and doesn't build on it in a meaningful way.  Their treatment of the characters we grew to love in my opinion is just horrible.  The inclusion of representation (gender identity politics) feels forced and transparent which comes across both lecturey and unnecessary in a post apocolyptic world whereas games like Dragonage Inquisition were able to include it without having that effect.  It also felt a bit immersion breaking to play as a female character that was obviously on steroids with hulking arms and legs - where does she get access to that much quality and quantity of food along with steroids in a post apocolyptic world where people are just trying to survive (the steroid physique is not an exaggeration).  To be clear I have no issue playing as female characters and where choice is given I usually do just that\\, I chose to play as Kassandra on AC Odyssey.As far as Last of Us gameplay goes again I feel that has remained in tact and improved\\, visually\\, functionally and shouldn't disappoint anyone familiar with and fond of the first\\, I would definitely buy a separate multiplayer if that's the route they choose to take.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
