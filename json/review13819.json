Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy came to bury Star Wars\\, and not enliven it\\, then their spark will light the fire that will burn the whole galactic edifice down. Little to no hope that JJ Abrams can restore any sense of fun or hope or mystery to this franchise in Episode Whatever. The porgs are cute\\, though.","true":true}
