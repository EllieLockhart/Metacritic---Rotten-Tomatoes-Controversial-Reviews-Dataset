Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No idea what Rian Johnson was smoking when he wrote this.  It contained a whole bunch of plot holes\\, awkward scenes\\, poorly executed ideas\\, and really corny philosophical concepts that didn't really connect to the plot.  Out of all the other star wars movies\\, this one is the worst.  Even out of most movies in general\\, it was pretty much bad all around.  The scenes don't really build you up to anything that makes sense overall\\, I just felt like they were throwing way too many ideas at me at the same time without going into enough details.  As a star wars movie\\, they sort of ruined a bunch of characters from the originals which really turned me off.","true":true}
