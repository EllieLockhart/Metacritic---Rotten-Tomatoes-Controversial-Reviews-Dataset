Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved this movie.  I want to see it 5 more times.\\n\\nI have been a Star Wars fan since I saw Return of the Jedi in the theater\\, the first movie I remember seeing in the theater.  This was a beautiful\\, unpredictable story full of interesting twists and misdirections.  I thought all the notes they hit were awesome\\, and I can't wait to see it again.","true":true}
