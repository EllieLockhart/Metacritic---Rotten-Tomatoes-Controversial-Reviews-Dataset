Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*Spoilers* It's not a good movie anyways\\n\\nThis movie was bad you lack the bond with characters that you felt in the original trilogy and the prequels. When luke was dying to Darth sidious we cared when Anakin was left for dead by obi wan we cared hit honestly the olnly person I care for at all is Rey.Also if snoke is strong enough to grab Rey a Jedi who can use the force means he is super strong. So why was kylo ren able to grab the lightsaber 2 feet away from snoke with the force and kill him. Like seriously he can grab Rey and treat her like a rag doll but cant stop kylo ren from grabbing the lightsaber 2 ft away from him. Also could the fight scene between kylo ren and luke be longer than 2 minutes and just to find out that it was basically just a hologram. This movie was garbage. The only good thing about this was seeing Leia use the force and seeing weapon variants in the vibroblades the praetorian guards used.","true":true}
