Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I made a point to see The Last Jedi at the earliest opportunity\\, so as to avoid having my enjoyment influenced by critics\\, fan reviews\\, or spoilers. But with that came the responsibility to not spoil it for others\\, so I chose not to openly discuss it or review it on social media until some time has passed. With opening weekend behind us\\, and the fan debate in full swing\\, I'll share my thoughts now. I'll do my best to avoid spoilers.\\n\\nI loved The Last Jedi. Ryan Johnson has crafted a unique Star Wars film that's weird\\, wild\\, and wonderful. From start to finish\\, there wasn't a moment of this two and a half hour film where I wasn't clamoring for more. Johnson takes some bold risks that pay off at every turn\\, creating a film that's visually stunning and emotionally resonant. He takes you places the saga has never been\\, both literally and philosophically. This is a movie that makes you question what you think you know about the good vs. evil dynamic. Forget about good guys\\, bad guys\\, heroes\\, and villains. These characters\\, be they established as legends or relative newcomers\\, they're all human. Humans are fallible. The themes that emerge from that idea give the film a suspenseful tone that previous Star Wars films have lacked. True\\, the odds for our heroes traditionally have never been great. But here\\, you feel the weight of those situations and the risks involved.\\n\\nI want to discuss Rey\\, Kylo Ren\\, Finn\\, Poe\\, and the new cast\\, but I feel like getting into their stories reveals too much. Everything I said above applies to them. I do want to address Luke and Leia\\, whose roles in this one expand beyond what amounted to cameos in The Force Awakens to a real reintroduction in The Last Jedi. I went from \\\"Oh there they are' to \\\"Oh THERE they are!\\\" And what a joy it is to reconnect with them.\\n\\nThis movie was a thrill from the opening scene to the end credits. It made me laugh\\, cheer\\, and even got me choked up at few points - all the while keeping me on the edge of my seat. Beyond that\\, it left me with questions - not just mysteries to be unraveled in the next installment\\, but real questions about the line between right and wrong\\, reevaluating established series concepts\\, and themes I'll discuss at a later point so as to let others discover them for themselves.\\n\\nAll this said\\, I'm genuinely upset at the negative fan backlash this film has received. I know other people's opinions on this shouldn't affect me\\, but it does. It hurts me to know that a movie that I found so enjoyable and moving and profound is met with hatred or apathy. I knew not everyone would love it\\, but I didn't expect fans to be this divided. I don't understand it. I plan on seeing it in theaters again\\, and it's practically guaranteed that I won't have the same feelings for it as I did when it was new and surprising. I'm hoping those who hated it but claim to love Star Wars would give it a second chance\\, too\\, and maybe their immediate dislike for it will cool down a bit. Either way\\, time will tell where it lands in the rankings of the greater Star Wars mythology. As for me\\, I got my money's worth and then some.","true":true}
