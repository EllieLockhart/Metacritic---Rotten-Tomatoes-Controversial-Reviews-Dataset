Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think that the story of Luke Skywalker has gone off course.  Why did the exertion of projecting his image across the galaxy kill him?  This seems like lazy writing.  The movie was visually stunning and I like the idea of the Resistance fleet being pursued and hounded by the First Order.  The dialogue about war profiteering could have been handled in a smarter manner.  The mirror cave seemed to serve no purpose as well.  The interactions between Rey and Kylo were great.","true":true}
