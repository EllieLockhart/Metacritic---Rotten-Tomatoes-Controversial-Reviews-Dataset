Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\/s\\n\\nI loved the movie\\, you guys are crazy.\\n\\nThe Finn\/Rose romance storyline was fantastic and a breath of fresh air. Truly the Romeo and Juliet of this generation\\n\\nLuke Skywalker was badass in this movie. The way he milked a sea cow and acted emo was awesome. I also like how he died by meditating\\n\\nI like that Snoke ended up having no backstory or anything and went out like a bitch. Was good to see them hype up a character and shock the fans by throwing him away so easily\\n\\nI like that Finn\/Rose\/Oscar devised this scheme to go to the casino city\\, sneak on to the starship and ultimately do nothing besides getting caught (and killing their friends I might add)\\n\\nI liked that they randomly killed beloved fan favorite Admiral Ackbar without any fanfare\\n\\nI like that they focused so much on purple haired captain and her death. She was such a pivotal character\\n\\n\/s","true":true}
