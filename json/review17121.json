Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed this movie.\\n\\nWhy are so many nerds online mad about it though? How did Disney \\\"ruin the franchise\\\"? Star Wars really shouldn't be held up to that high of standards... Did you see the prequels? Did you see how campy some of the originals even are?","true":true}
