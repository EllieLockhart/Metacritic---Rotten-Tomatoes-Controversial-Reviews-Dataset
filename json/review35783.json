Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"'The Last Jedi' is going to make a lot of money for Disney\\, so in respect to it being a product and considering its return on investment the picture is a financial success.  But the studio executives would be wrong to assume anything beyond just that\\, and for a 4 billion dollar acquisition which they hope to have legs\\, that's a big problem.  Because film is also an artistic media\\, creative interests are also an important consideration and objectively it's very hard to argue that this is not a deeply compromised work.  \\nUltimately one person to blame for this unnecessary situation\\, and her name is Kathleen Kennedy.\\nAs the Executive Producer of Lucasfilm\\, Mrs. Kennedy has the unenviable task of serving two masters: the powers that be at the Mouse House whom sank $4 billion into a galaxy far far away and want their money back with interest\\, and an important consumer base which has very particular demands of what an epic saga that has come to define the cinematic tastes and expectations of multiple generations of filmgoers.\\nStar Wars is a transcendental piece of art\\, it has eclipsed its genre and has become embedded into the mainstream culture.\\nImportant to the continued success of the Star Wars property into the foreseeable future is a coherent and intelligible evolution of the lore that is both recognizable yet enriching with fresh elements whilst paying respect to what came before\\, 'The Last Jedi' fails spectacularly on both fronts.\\nWithout spoiling specific story elements\\, the film severely alters course in terms of important plot elements established in \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" without practical rationale or logical explanation consistent with the audiences' understanding of the events and characters to date.\\nThe result here is a jarring experience for viewers as these abrupt course changes in character and story narrative. Fostering a cognitive dissonance between what the audience was led to expect by way of previous installments in the series and the reconciling those shared collective memories with the narrative choices and vision of 'The Last Jedi'.\\nIn television\\, having multiple writers and directors splitting duties in an episodic series is a practical necessity; and given Disney's desire to crank out a Star Wars film every year\\, the same approach is necessary here as well\\, but what works in television with a strong producer team of showrunners reconciling disparate works into a unified season\/series is lacking at Lucasfilm.\\n2015's Force Awakens had a troubled pre-production with the dismissal of Lucas' original outlines for the sequel trilogy followed by defection from writers ultimately leading to JJ Abrams and Star Wars script veteran Larry Kasdan coming in to clean up and shoot the first installment.  'Rogue One' similarly suffered from a troubled production and required re-shoots.  It's been confirmed that the new Han Solo project has also suffered production chaos necessitating even more extensive re-shoots as well.  On top of that\\, Episode IX is in turmoil with directorial changes once again and late script being submitted to the studio by replacement director\\, JJ Abrams. 'Last Jedi' suffers from even more egregious issues than the other aforementioned Disney\/Lucasfilm productions whereas the critical flaws such as weak writing and poor continuity of character and even prop placement were allowed to be baked into the cake and show on-screen.  \\nThis latest entry in the saga is bloated in runtime\\, laden with a B-subplot seemingly taken out of the worst ideas of the Lucas prequels with ultimately no narrative impact in the final outcome of the film\\, and most egregious of all fails to deliver on the important questions raised not by the fans but by the series itself in the hanging plot elements left unresolved by the last installment.\\nIn closing\\, the 'Last Jedi' may be both the best looking and worst written Star Wars entry of the whole series and potentially paints its successors into rough narrative corners from which there may be little to no escape from commercial and artistic disappointment.\\nP.S. There is no gravity to 'drop' bombs in space\\, Luke's lightsaber is green-bladed not blue. #ContinuityMatters","true":true}
