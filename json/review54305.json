Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had such a promising start - a daredevil stunt by a cocky but self-assured pilot with some dry-faced humour from the First Order soldiery.  It rapidly started to fall apart\\, taking what were key cornerstones to the franchise style and trying to shoehorn them into nonsensical side-stories that ended up in the most cringe-worthy declaration of love I've seen in a long\\, long time.  When compared with the originals (now hear me out before assuming what I have to say) there was no distinct real aim that the rebels could have bannered behind\\, whilst the First Order could have summoned in another fleet in front of the rebel ships left over.\\n\\nWeirdly\\, the one thing that let me down was the dreadful set for the Kylo Ren\/Rey fight scene vs the rest.  The backdrop looked weak and contrived\\, and completely impractical for what it was meant to be.  And the fight scene made me cringe\\, watching Daisy desperately looking for Driver's side to maintain the fight scene.\\n\\nLastly\\, I just hope that things are lightened a bit. Have the meaning no less important\\, but use tricks\\, smart tactics and double-triple betrayals.  Forget the empowerment of any group is unimportant\\, just can people play the roles\\, or bring something new to the roles.  That's it - as an 'old skool' Star Wars fan I really don't give a crud about social politics\\, I wanted to see an adventure like we did in Episodes 5 and 6.","true":true}
