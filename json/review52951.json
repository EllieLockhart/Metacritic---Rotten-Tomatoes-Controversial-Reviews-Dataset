Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Apart from being surprised that there were inserted jokes which seemed out-of-character (allowing for a new director used to Star Trek humor)\\, the movie delivered.  Space combat (X-wings\\, Tie fighters\\, Star destroyers\\, rebel capital ships\\, plus more)\\, Jedi lightsabre fights\\, passing of the baton (old cast new cast)\\, Jedi lore\\, storyline closure... all there.  The only disconnect was the \\\"let's get a a codebreaker from a gambling planet\\\" in the middle of the Rebel's \\\"last stand\\\" space battle (which conveniently became a slow motion chase) seemed to be forced. It also opens the door to use \\\"light-speed travel\\\" to be a fixer for any impending doom.  I mean\\, the \\\"let's let them run out of gas\\\" thing was a bit rough.  The First Order literally had a half dozen star destroyers with full compliments of tie fighters and that is their tactic? Suspended belief on these topics still lends itself to high marks for enjoyment with all the space and laser rich combat (and no Jar Jars or kids racing pods).","true":true}
