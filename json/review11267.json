Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly\\, the movie is...intersting. I like the story and it's actually a good idea. The characters are fine and the acting is ok but man the way it was pulled off. Captian Phasma's fate is wasted potential. Imagine HER becoming the Supreme Leader. Wasted potential. Luke's fate as well. The movie is overral fine","true":true}
