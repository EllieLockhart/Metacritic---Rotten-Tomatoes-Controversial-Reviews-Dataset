Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Can they please stop making this shit up as they go? Good god the story can't go anywhere like this.\\n\\nSpoiler Warning:\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n*Fin stays friend zoned where cowards belongs.\\n*Cool surprise fight scene where Snoke gets axed. \\n*Kylo gains an ounce of masculinity and pulls a coup d'\u00e9tat.\\n*Production value was top notch.\\n*Yoda.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n*Moral of the story: Don't take risks and don't question authority.\\n*Completely undid the only interesting ideas about the last movie (The Snoke\/Rey origin mysteries).\\n*Milking scene.\\n*Rose.\\n*Anti rich people propaganda. Which is funny\\, because the people who produced this crap...........are rich.\\n*Hollywood is incapable of making a movie without blatant political propaganda and now they've ruined Star Wars with it.\\n*Poor Mark Hamill's legacy was flushed down the toilet. He should sue.\\n*No Obi Wan or Anakin ghosts. We know they can be ghosts. We seent it.\\n*FEAR OF WHAT THEY WILL DO NEXT. I can see the next boardroom meeting \\\"Hey guys. What if force ghosts were like...a Scooby Do thing? You know\\, like\\, they aren't real. What if we make it so it's been some guy trolling this whole time?\\\".\\n\\nThey don't care about our reviews. They only care about sales. So for that reason\\, I'm done spending money on Star Wars until they get their shit together.","true":true}
