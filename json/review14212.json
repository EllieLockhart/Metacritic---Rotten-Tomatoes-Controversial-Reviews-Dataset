Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I get the low scores but I enjoyed it and thought it was definitely a good movie. little bummed that it was a separate movie that didn't answer any of the questions from force awakens.....snoke\\, reys parents (weak explanation)\\, kylo's knights...I think that this could have been so much better but it was still a good movie and I left the theatre kind of in shock. Lots happened and what we all wished happened with Luke didn't happen...but it was still a good movie. hopefully the 3rd one will answer some of these questions and somehow tie it all together. I got faith in Abrams to do this last one right. ","true":true}
