Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I think a reason that people are reviewing it poorly is that it's different from the ideas they put in their head about what it would be. The story is well written. There are a few less than believable parts during the movie\\, but most fantasy movies have those portions. Will definitely watch another time in theaters and look forward.","true":true}
