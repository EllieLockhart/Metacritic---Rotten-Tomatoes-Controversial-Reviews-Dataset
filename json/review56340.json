Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Tamara W said it best and I quote :\\n\\n\\\"The movie was visually stunning\\, with all of the VFX that we have come to expect. Some Matrix-style camera work in one of the main fights was disconcerting\\, as it didn't connect with the rest of the movie style.\\n\\nThat said\\, the movie is very weak. There is no story arc\\, as everyone ends up in essentially the same place at the end of the movie as they were in at the start. The Luke storyline is excessively introspective\\, to no point. The Finn storyline feels like an add on - oh\\, we forgot him\\, what can we have him do for 30 minutes?\\n\\nCharacter motivations are opaque\\, and the resolution of the main storyline comes completely from left field\\, using something apparently picked out of a hat\\, with no connection to anything before. Of the 3 new major characters\\, only one has a raison d'\u00c3\u00aatre\\, and resolves adequately - the other two appear without justification\\, and leave without having had a point. And the entire movie climax is based on a Jedi \\\"power\\\" that I don't remember ever seeing before... which is probably why it is so effective on the bad guys.\\n\\nI left the movie\\, wanting it to be great. 16 hours later\\, I have to say that it was more pointless and aimless than Ep 1.\\n\\n2 stars is for the visuals. If you are deeply invested in Star Wars\\, you will likely be disappointed. If you are new to the franchise\\, you will wonder what all the hype was about.\\\"","true":true}
