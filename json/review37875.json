Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The saga continues. I liked the The Force awakens\\, but The Last Jedi is a bit more dicey proposition. It's interesting that the critics nearly unanimously prize\\, and significant segment of the audience completely rejects it\\, giving it no star or one star out of five; the comments show that large segment of the audience is really disappointed. Why might that be? Maybe because in the story the good and evil\\,the force and the dark force are again too close to each other\\, Ray being attracted to Kylo\\, like Luke was attracted to his father Darth Vader. It's another variation on the familiar topics\\, a recognizable pattern. But this twists and turns in the plot have their role in the making of this cosmic fantasy. I jast hope that the next film\\, the third part of the this trilogy will not offer again poor acting as was the case with Mark Hamill in first trilogy and Hayden Chrstiansen in the second and that we already have some indications in this film. The next installment is of crucial importance\\, it'll either vindicate this one or bury it. With the full awareness that we are dealing with Hollywood spectacle targeting mostly children\\, their parents and old fans that got hooked on the saga as children. If we take this discount into account\\, overall not a bad movie\\,","true":true}
