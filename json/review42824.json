Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie wasn't all bad\\, I think parts of it should even be a shoo in for some awards....\\n\\nWorst script = Rian Johnson\\nObvious product placement = Porgs\\nMost likely to make you miss Jar Jar Binks = Rose\\nBiggest in-your-face feminazi = Purple haired lady\\nMost underused character = Chewbacca\\nCringiest kiss ever laid in a movie = Rose again\\nLamest death scene = Snoke\\nWorst character assassination = Luke\\nLaugh-out-loud scene that wasn't supposed to be funny = Leia Poppins\\nMost annoyingly patronizing speech ever given = Rose for the trifecta!\\n\\nSo please stop with your \\\"this was awful\\\" and \\\"The Last Jedi ruined my childhood\\\".   Instead\\, eat the tripe Disney has given us and don't forget to say thank you!","true":true}
