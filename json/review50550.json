Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"2\/10.  Visually and audio-wise\\, this was the best Star Wars movie yet\\, and if that was all that mattered this would be a masterpiece.  Unfortunately\\, it isn't and this movie is a dumpster fire of missed opportunities\\, plot holes\\, and social justice bullcrap.\\n\\nI'd say skip it\\, but everyone should see this as a warning of what not to do with a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
