I understand why controversy surrounds it\\, but I truly hope that folks realize the controversy was inevitable. This is game designed to put you through its paces\\, to force you to experience its narrative. It\u2019s not a game about choices\\, which by itself makes it sort of a throwback in these days of almost infinite character design and open worlds. This is a game with a story to tell\\, and it requires you to travel with it.\r\rAnd what a story it is\\, far more akin to a novel than a game. You won\u2019t be able to empathize with one character throughout\\, because that character\u2019s actions will force you to reevaluate your feelings. Likewise\\, your initial impressions of other characters will change because of their deeds and motivations. I\u2019ve never seen anything like in a game before. It\u2019s clear that enormous thought and planning and artistry went into this story before any programmer touched a keyboard.\r\rPerhaps that is what impresses me most about the game\\, that Naughty Dog had a singular vision and\\, holy hell\\, did they follow through on it. I still find it hard to grasp the sheer scope of it all\\, the ridiculous beauty of the mountains surrounding Jackson\\, the heartbreaking devastation of Seattle\\, the set pieces that had me as tense as I\u2019ve ever felt during a game. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I asked\\, \u201cHow did they do that?\u201d Even though it\u2019s been seven years since the original\\, it\u2019s hard to believe they pulled off this massive \u2014 there\u2019s no other word for it \u2014 world in such detail.\r\rI will play it again\\, but not anytime soon. I want to approach it after it\u2019s not so fresh in my mind. If you are on the fence\\, or have been concerned by the mixed or negative reviews\u2014please\\, give it a shot. This game was created by talented professionals working at the very peak of their powers. You may love it\\, you may hate it\\, but I promise you that it is an experience you won\u2019t soon forget.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
