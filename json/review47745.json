Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When my 9 year old son\\, who loves Star Wars\\, has no idea what is going on\\, it is truly a poorly made film.  The blame lies squarely on Mr. Johnson and those who hired him since he doesn't know what it is that people like about Star Wars.","true":true}
