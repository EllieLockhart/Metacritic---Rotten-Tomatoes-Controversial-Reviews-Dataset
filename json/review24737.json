Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Much better than all the negative reviews suggest. Looks like Star Wars is now getting trolled with people sending in negative reviews when they haven\u2019t even seen the movie. The movie has its flaws but the overall experience was very satisfying. It filled me with great joy of which I haven\u2019t had since the original movies from the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s. ","true":true}
