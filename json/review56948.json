Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The visuals were amazing. Looked great. Sound design was pitch perfect and the CGI was seemless. But I come to Star Wars for the world and the story which wasn't present beyond deconstructing the plot and fan theories by the director. It wasn't much a story\\, more of a screenwriter monologue about being invested means nothing since anything can be dismantled\\, subverted\\, killed or omitted enitrely. Didn't feel like a continuation to the story of The Force Awakens\\, changed everything about the film in a way that cuts off any overarching plotlines\\, breaks canon by utilizing the in-universe technology in a way that makes space battles pointless and feels like a 15 minute episode rather than a 2 hour feature film. I like Rian's work but he himself said that he hates working with an already built universe and especially with a story that isn't enitrely under him control (he prefers one-off stories\\, which seems to be perfect for his style). The Last Jedi was a mistake that derailed the entire trilogy and begun the downfall of Disney Star Wars","true":true}
