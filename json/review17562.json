Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Is it bad that I think Star Wars the last Jedi sucked more than Episode 1? I think at this point I\u2019ll take Jar Jar Binks and Hayden\u2019s horrible lines over whatever shit Disney calls Star Wars these days. I really enjoyed Ray & Snoke. That\u2019s pretty much it. Lol. The new characters they\u2019ve introduced in this trilogy are not worth killing off any of the old ones. Disney has a choice to make I think. Bring J.J Abrams back for episode 9 or just sell Lucas arts to Someone else. Someone willing to fix the total mess that is Star Wars the \u201cNew\u201d generation.","true":true}
