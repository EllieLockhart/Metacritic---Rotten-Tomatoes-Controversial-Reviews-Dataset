Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great movie. I feel like a lot of the hate is due to people going in with a certain expectation about how the movie was supposed to go. Rian Johnson doesn't service the fans and uses the characters and plot how he wants to which will upset fans who had strong theories they wanted him to use.","true":true}
