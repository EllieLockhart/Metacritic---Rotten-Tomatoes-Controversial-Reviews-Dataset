Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Aside from the casino part I really liked The Last Jedi. The new look on the jedi is really interesting and the subversion of the hot shot pilot solving everything is very refreshing.","true":true}
