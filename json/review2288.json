Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A trainwreck of a movie that pushes a beloved franchise off a cliff and into an erupting volcano. There are too many narratives happening at the same time\\, too many plot twists\\, and too much nonsensical behavior from characters with little to no evolution. Several cinematic and choreographic blunders can also be spotted in the film.","true":true}
