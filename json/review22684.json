Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like Mark Hamil said\\, I fundementally disagreed with everything Rian Johnson had in store for Luke. TLJ disrespected the original trilogy. The characters all felt \\\"out of character\\\". Luke's treatment was particularly cruel and unjust. The film created many plot holes raised more questions than answers. For the Star Wars fan\\, this was a hard movie to take in. It felt like the fans were being disrespected. The movie itself wasn't bad. If you are a casual fan or just wanna see a good movie\\, this is the movie for you. But for the die hard fan\\, this was a huge disappointment that really destroyed the legacy that The Return of The Jedi left. As a die hard fan\\, I was very sad and unimpressed with the direction that Rian Johnson went.","true":true}
