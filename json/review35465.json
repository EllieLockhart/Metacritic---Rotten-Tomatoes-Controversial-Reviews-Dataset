Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi does not honors the saga's rich legacy. The new adding things are parody\\, which was not nessecery at these level and there is no respect to grow up the new characters or to keep the old ones as they really was or failed to explain the changes over the characters. Too much parody and too much funny moments where they had no place. The biggest problem is that there is no real connection to the prior movies\\, as this was not a stand alone movie . Disney killed Luke and stole the books of JEdi knowledge to keep up with the crime it started over the Saga","true":true}
