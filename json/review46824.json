Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well paced\\, full of twists\\, left you guessing what would happen next. Action scenes are tight and full of drama and many shots look like paintings they are so beautiful. Rian Johnson did his homework\\, paying homage to samurai and king fu films\\, the World War Two epics and thrillers that influenced George Lucas. A fitting send off to a beloved character and some damn fine supporting performances as well.","true":true}
