Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The haters should re-watch the original movies\\, especially Return of the Jedi. This is a better film\\, while doing many of the same things\\, but better. The plotting in the middle\\, with Finn and with Poe is not incredible\\, but  Jabba's palace... The asteroid chase and hiding in the Space Slug.. They were the most important to the overall plot either. I loved Luke in this\\, a human\\, a Jedi\\, and a true Master.  Like\\, watch Justice League and then this.. no comparison and no bad CGI lips!","true":true}
