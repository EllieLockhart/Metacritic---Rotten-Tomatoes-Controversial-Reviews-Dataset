{"101487":100300,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-11","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A good example of \\\"How to make a bad movie\\\". \\nSo many wasted opportunites\\, so disappointing. At times it felt just like a parody with all the \\\"not so good\\\" jokes. \\nIt was so eyebrow raising from the beginning with again no explanation\\, why the First Order is so powerfull. This mess has got a \\\"Your Momma\\\"Joke\\, an out-of-place \\\"Flat Iron\\\" Scene\\, a totally unimportant subplot\\, where people actually get in jail for parking the car in the wrong spot(!)\\, a completely change in the character of Luke Skywalker\\, he\u00b4s now a whiny old man that milks seacows and disrespects the Lightsaber of his father by tossing it away emotionless. \\nThey forced in some cute birds just to make you buy the stuffed animal version of it. These so called Porgs don\u00b4t serve a purpose in the movie at all! They\u00b4re just there. Back in the day the Ewoks were cute too\\, but they at least HAD a relevance for the plot\\, even saved\/helped our heroes. Guess giving potential merchendise a reason to be in the movie in the first place is no longer needed these days.\\nThe ridiculous mirror scene to reveal Reys parents was straight from Harry Potter just like the fleeing on the back of some giant cat\/camel-horse animals\\, the guys had to free from their cages they were kept in for bad bad entertainment of animal racing. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH STAR WARS!\\nTo round things up\\, Leia flies like Superman in Space\\, an underwhelming reveal of Reys parents\\, Kylo takes his shirt off \\, Chewie goes vegan and Snoke dies like he was an unimportant extra.\\nThey introduced new force powers out of the blue like force skype and astro projection.\\nThey treated the main protagonist of the whole franchise Luke Skywalker like a nobody\\, like rubbish you have to get rid of quickly. They did\u00b4t even give him a last challenge to take on or a last decent fight with a lightsaber. He only force projects an image of himself in front of Kylo as a decoy. That\u00b4s all! Unbelieveable! He then dies cause he is too exhausted!\\nAnd as icing on the cake\\, the movie ends with a scene that just could have been a toys r us commercial.\\nTFA was a bad rehash of Episode 4. But The last Jedi is way beyond bad\\, it\u00b4s a weak movie with a ridiculous plot. And it\u00b4s the worst Star Wars Movie of all.","true":true}
