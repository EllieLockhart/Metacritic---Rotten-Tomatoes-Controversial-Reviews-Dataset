Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie - it harkened back to the original trilogy and felt heartwarming and action packed. The effects were well done\\, the scenery was beautiful and the acting and dialogue fits right in with its place in the new trilogy and it's Empire Strikes Back positioning. I went in wanting space opera and I got it in spades :)","true":true}
