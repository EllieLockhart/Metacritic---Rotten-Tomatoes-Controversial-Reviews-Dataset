{"101487":121280,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-21","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Firstly\\, I am NOT a bot\\, no matter what Disney wants you to believe. Secondly\\, this is my first time signing up and reviewing a film on Rotten Tomatoes; and Thirdly\\, if you are NOT a Star Wars fan and you like pretty\/eye candy action films (no shame in that)\\, you might enjoy this film in the same way you might enjoy Pacific Rim\\, Thor Ragnarok (which I personally enjoyed btw ) etc.\\n\\n***SPOILERS*** \\n\\nWithout getting into too many details (I could write a book on the problems of this movie on so many levels) I will say this:\\n\\nThe Last Jedi fails (1) as respectable Film in general\\, (2) it fails as a Sci-film Film\\, (3) it fails as a sequel to The Force Awakens\\, and (4) most importantly it fails as a Star Wars film.\\n\\n1. It fails a respectable Film\\, as although the visuals and score are very very good\\, and the performances are not bad at all\\, everything else falls flat. The tone is all over the place\\, the pacing is bad\\, the editing is jerky\\, the writing is full of plot holes and non-sequiturs\\, there are several manufactured and forced twists\/themes throughout\\, and it comes off as extremely messy.\\n\\n2. It fails as a Sci-fi movie\\, as physics\\, space\\, and logic are thrown out the window completely (space apparently has gravity and atmosphere whenever it suits the script)\\, and it is very inconsistent about the ''rules of the game'' in several cases. Eye-candy value only.\\n\\n3. It fails as a sequel to The Force Awakens\\, as it drops almost all questions and themes raised by the first film in the new trilogy (Snoke background\/importance\\, Ray's background\/backstory\\, the knights of Ren\\, Finns in-ability to pilot\\, etc etc etc)\\n\\n4. And finally\\, and worst of all\\, it Fails HARD as a Star Wars film\\, as it proceeds to blatantly disrespect\\, betray\\, and completely demolish Luke Skywalker's character\\, and almost all of the achievements\\, progress\\, and sacrifices made by the characters of the original trilogy. World building is not only non-existent\\, but the film actually throws away\/goes against many aspects of the Star Wars galaxy\\, society\\, rules\\, relationships\\, and world in general in terms of structure and logic on several levels. Tone\/humor\/atmosphere is cringy and very out of place especially for Star Wars\\, and not to mention nit-picks such as making up new rules regarding the force and space battles\\, timeline issues\\, non-sequiturs etc etc etc.\\n\\nExtremely disappointing in many ways and on several levels. Almost feels like a joke\/troll Film (This is not an exaggeration). Feels forced\\, sloppy\\, arrogant\\, disrespectful\\, shallow\\, hamfisted\\, lazy\\, and frankly very dumb.\\n\\nMy final statement\\, which I say with a very heavy heart\\, realizing the implications and weight of it; and something I honestly never thought would be possible\\, is: The Last Jedi is most probably the WORST Star Wars film in the franchise (including the amazingly cringe-worthy prequels). # NewFoundRespectForGeorgeLucas \\n\\n*Have seen the film twice\\, just to make sure.","true":true}
