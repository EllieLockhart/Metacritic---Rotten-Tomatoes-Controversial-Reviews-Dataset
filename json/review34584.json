Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The biggest Problem with the movie is\\, that it doesn't feel like a Star Wars Movie. It feels like a Marvel Movie in the Star Wars universe. Poorly written\\, lazy story\\, a lot of stuff that doesn't fit into the lore\\, really unnecessary \\\"side-quests\\\" that prolong the film\\, always looking for the cheap laugh. In all I'm very disappointed after such a promising \\\"The Force Awakens\\\". J.J. Abrams really has a been left with a mess for the last Episode... I wish him luck\\, because I really liked his Star Wars Movie... The Last Jedi is so far the weakest of them all... (There are even figures that are more unnecessary than Jaja Binks...)","true":true}
