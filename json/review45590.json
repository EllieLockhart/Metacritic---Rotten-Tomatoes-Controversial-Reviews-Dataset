Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing\\, passionless filmmaking Disney only cares about appealing to the masses and their bottom line. Not good for long term Star Wars fans. Hurts to see what Disney has done to a franchise I have held dear to my heart for so long.","true":true}
