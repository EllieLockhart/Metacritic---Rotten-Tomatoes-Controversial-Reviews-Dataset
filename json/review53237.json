Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bribing critics and manipulating audience scores won't save this film!!   \\nIt'll still make a LOT of money BUT... in the long term\\, its damaged the 'brand' and diminished its value.\\n\\nConsider these facts: Its 2nd week box office plunge\u00a0was the steepest in history.  It has just bombed in China (despite Force Awakens doing well there).  It has prompted a petition\u00a0(drawing over 80\\,000 signatures as of writing) demanding it be 'struck from canon'.  Even its FAKE audience score is still the lowest in the saga. And for the first time in the franchise's 40yr history\\, there are predictions the next entry (a Han Solo spinoff scheduled for May) could flop. \\n\\nThats what happens when you prioritise identity politics over telling a good story. You have paid the price for your lack of vision\\, Disney!","true":true}
