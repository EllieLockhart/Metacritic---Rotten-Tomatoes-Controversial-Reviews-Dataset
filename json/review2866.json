Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful... the best example of bad story telling I have ever seen. Written by an arrogant baffoon. If only there was a way to delete this movie from existence. Waited eagerly for two years and got slapped in the face by a Johnson. Marvellous... count me out for any future Disney Star Wars movies. I won't be wasting my time or money as they clearly don't give a shit about fans.","true":true}
