Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Darth Vader will be turning in fire pit... Disney have remade Space balls and called it a Star Wars film...  Could probably be made only worst by a film on Jar Jar Binks life story\\, surely coming\\, think of the merchandise Disney !! No plot development\\, one liners every two minutes\\, Leia as Mary Poppins... This really was an insult!!","true":true}
