Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too short in my opinion. So many characters\\, so much story to tell. They should have split this movie up. One can hope for more when the extended cut is on disc next year.","true":true}
