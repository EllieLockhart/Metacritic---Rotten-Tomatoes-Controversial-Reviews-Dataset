Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie. I'm a hardcore Star Wars fan\\, and though there were some aspects that I didn't love\\, this felt like the most Star Wars-y addition to the franchise that we've seen since the original trilogy. I felt immersed in the world we were introduced to in ANH. The humor really landed with me\\, we got amazing character development\\, and it was just a lot of fun. The visuals were stunning as well. I don't understand  what the negative reviewers really want. People complained that TFA was too much like ANH\\, so they try something totally different with Last Jedi and they still have something to complain about. For me\\, it wasn't what I expected but that was why i loved it. It was fresh but it also felt familiar. The second half is definitely stronger than the first\\, but overall it was a great movie.","true":true}
