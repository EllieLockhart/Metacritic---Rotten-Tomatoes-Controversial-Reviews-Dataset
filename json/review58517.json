(I play on Survivor so the AI is a bit more human and challenging\\, since they\u2019re kind of dumb on moderate difficulty) On moderate things can get too easy and bland. I strongly recommend the challenge of Survivor difficulty. I am definitely going back for a second playthrough\u2026 Expand","true":true}
