Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie threw out the window everything that The Force Awakens developed. It felt like a confusing cluster fuck rather than a developed story line. The movie makes me think of essays that have not been proofread. \\n\\nI felt it was shitting on fans for the hell of it. They built up all these mysteries and egged fans on ... only to decide these weren't mysteries at all.","true":true}
