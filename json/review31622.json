Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So my mind is open and I will say that this was not a good installment. The bad moments far outweighed the few good moments in this film. Also I am all about a different story and the unexpected. However the different story and the unexpected needed to be good. In this movie\\, that was not the case for most of it. It was underwhelming & all over the place. There is no build off of what was started in episode 7. A few scenes were good but a lot of things just felt out of place.\\n\\nIt currently has a lower audience score than the Phantom Menace. And it deserves it. This release also proves that 'critics' are well paid for their lies.","true":true}
