Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably my least favourite Star Wars movie I've seen. Worse than the prequels. So many plot holes\\, so many epic sub-plot setups from the previous movie that were scrapped. Just a mess! Very disappointing\\, This movie makes it seem that there is no hope of another trilogy that is even close to the original. I struggle to see the last movie solving this mess. \\nI only hope that the spin offs stay good.","true":true}
