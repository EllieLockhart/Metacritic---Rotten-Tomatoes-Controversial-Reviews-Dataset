Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is not perfect but it is a fantastic movie.  It is fun and exciting\\, the characters are interesting.  I grew up with Star Wars.  I saw A New Hope in the theater when I was seven and have been hooked ever since.  Nothing will be like the summer of 1980 when Empire Strikes back was released.  Trying to compare these films to those is just silly\\, so don't try.  But this film is worthy in its own right and is already firing the passions of a whole new generation.  I took my son and his friends to see this and they came out with a look on their face that sent me back to that summer of 1980 because I had the same look then.  They were talking about the events and what will happen and plotting some of there own.  Thank you Star Wars!!!!","true":true}
