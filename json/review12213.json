Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am going to see it again but my first impression is that this movie took the Star Wars Rebels approach. It's technically Star Wars but not for anyone who already liked Star Wars. This did not feel like a sequel to SFA at all. After the second view I could appreciate the story more. I can't give it higher than +1 in good conscience though.","true":true}
