Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Though the movie suffers from the Canto Bight fiasco and the poor usage of BDT\\, it excels in its Rey\/Kylo character arc and Luke's handling.  This movie will stand the test of time.","true":true}
