Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would have to be 10 years old as a young boy so excited about the Star Wars universe\\, to watch Star Wars for the first time where technology has that fashion and style that isn't the 70's or 80's old school sense of humor\\, this being 2010s where evil becomes more like breaking the ice\\, becoming angry is the new style instead of smiling and being a polite stereotype - be angry\\, swear if you have to we aint first-time strangers unless I suffer memory loss not knowing who you are kind of we aint perfect but we move forward to be polite in public places like school or workplace. Being middle aged at 54\\, I can see employment of all kinds in this movie- people need to work to survive without losing their marbles and doing time in the mental hospital or prison.  \/*\\;\\,.","true":true}
