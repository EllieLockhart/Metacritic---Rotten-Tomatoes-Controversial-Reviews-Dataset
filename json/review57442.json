Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was good\\, in terms of a random space\/sci-fi movie.\\nHowever\\, in terms of the Star Wars franchise\\, this movie was impressively terrible. So many subplots that were useless or make no sense. Characters acting out of character\\, from an established canonical point of view.  And perhaps the worse of all\\, a completely wasted chance to have Luke and Leia work together in what is now the last movie that will have both of them in it. In short\\, watch this movie if you want to see some cool CGI\\, not if you want to see more of the Star Wars saga.","true":true}
