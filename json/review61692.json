Enemies are incredibly lifelike and fighting humans is really fun\\, although there are some annoying sections that feel like filler with random infected\\, there are some key moments with the infected that are well executed and they are some of the most memorable encounters. Scrambling around for parts is also a pain\\, and takes you out of the flow of the game frequently.\r\rThe worst part of the game for me was the pacing and the story jumping around. You will play as multiple characters and the transition between them is jarring and not very satisfying. I kept trying to plow through certain content just to get back to the characters I was invested in. Some of the back and forts are outright frustrating.\r\rAs for the story\\, there are some legitimate complaints here. I found some characters to be unlikable and some arcs to be a bit out of place in the universe\\, but overall its nothing too jarring and I think the story ends up being a pretty satisfying ride that reaches very high highs at times.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
