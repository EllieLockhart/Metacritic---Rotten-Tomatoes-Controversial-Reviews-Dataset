Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A bunch of fresh and exciting new ideas\\, locations\\, and directions for the franchise\\, all to be bogged down by an insufferable quip quota beyond even that of a Marvel film. Every sequence that began to resemble the heart and wonder of Star Wars was spliced with throwaway humor\\, the likes of which you'd expect in the DVD extras 'Gag Reel'. Every moment that began to build tension was immediately neutered by some tone deaf interruption. I do not mean that Star Wars is to be humorless - some of the comedy worked\\, staying in character and in tune with the containing scenes much like that of the other films. However the rest will take quite the surgery with a digital hacksaw to cut out. Given the nature of these flaws\\, inconsequential to the plot as they are\\, and the strong narrative around which the film is built\\, I'm confident that this film will be edited by dedicated fans into a fairly enjoyable addition to the franchise upon digital release. Regardless\\, the movie as it is in the theaters today is nothing short of a disappointment.","true":true}
