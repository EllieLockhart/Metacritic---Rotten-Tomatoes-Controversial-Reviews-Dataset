Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Has as many fun moments and characters as any other Star Wars movie\\, while still being thought-provoking and relevant. The element I think I enjoyed most from\\, aside from the stunning visuals\\, was an understated performance from Benicio Del Toro\\, who steals every scene he's in.","true":true}
