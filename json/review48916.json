Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars ever. The movie is only a Plothole. The changed Lukes Char Totally. The Story is dumb and boring. Every Charakter Acts irrational. The Movies destroys everything. Star Wars is not fairy tale for Kids and Adults anymore.","true":true}
