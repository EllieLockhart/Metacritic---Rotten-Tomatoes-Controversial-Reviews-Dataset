Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This new run of the Star-War saga lives up to many of the earlier telling of the story with great acting - special effects a few twist & turns here & there that makes the story feel fresh & alive so that the time seems to go by very quickly! Another part of the saga that you would want to see over just to get the parts that you may have missed the 1st time around!","true":true}
