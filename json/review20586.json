Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never posted a review on Rotten Tomatoes\\, but I feel obligated to support this film's audience rating given the groupthink panning that seems to have taken off. I thoroughly enjoyed the film\\, especially the deeper character development of Kylo & Rey\\, & the tense relationship that emerged between them. And kudos for the original script (compared with the lazy rehashing of the plots of IV & V in The Force Awakens). These new films are never going to be the Skywalker fairy tales of the original line-up -- nor should they be -- so get over it\\, fellow fans. And let's be thankful that they're not the pathetically scripted prequels with poorly cast Anakin\\, which still irks me (so disappointing). I'd rank this as one of the top four Star Wars alongside IV & V.","true":true}
