Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The fact that this movie has received massively different ratings from the critics and the moviegoers is actually pretty understandable. This was two films; one is sort of bland\\, ridiculous\\, when-will-this-be-over\\, and the other is this fantastic\\, edge of your seat\\, highly satisfying\\, electrically charged experience. The difference is notable by anyone who's seen the film. Scenes with Kylo Ren\\, Rey\\, and\/or Luke are brilliant. The rest of the movie is so unimpressive by contrast\\, you get the feeling that these actors had a different writer and director for their scenes. I will say this\\, that no matter how bad half the film is\\, the rest of it is so good that when I got out of that theatre\\, I was absolutely enthralled. I had forgotten that there were ridiculous floating Leia's and a half-baked side kick for Finn. Who cares? For me\\, the good parts were good enough that I wouldn't care if they brought Jar Jar Binks back\\, as long as he didn't interact with the golden three. Five stars\\, because I haven't been that excited coming out of a theatre since I was a kid.","true":true}
