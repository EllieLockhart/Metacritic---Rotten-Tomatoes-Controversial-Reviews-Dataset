Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A very boring episode of the Star Wars saga.  At no point during the viewing if this movie did I feel any sense of adventure or danger.  Anyone claiming to have been on the edge of their seat is either lying or lives a life so sheltered that anything other than staring at a computer screen is exciting. \\n\\nWhile some people are upset about the way the legacy characters were treated\\, my biggest grip is I do not care one bit what happens to Rey\\, Kylo\\, Finn\\, Poe or anyone else in this franchise.  Sorry Disney\\, you lost a lifelong Star Wars fan.   The past two movies were not Star Wars movies.","true":true}
