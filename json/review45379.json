Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Vastly copied & pasted from ESB\/RotJ\\, turned into a 150 minute gag reel by splattergun of over-the-top\\, inappropriate humour. Impossible to generate or maintain drama. The 'hero' (Rey) is a model of social media narcissism: 'I don't need to train\\, I demand instant ability'. And the film bends over to give her it.\\n\\nThere's nothing left to care about for Episode IX. No capable villain\\, no cohesive threat to the galaxy\\, no plausible hero\\, no notable rebellion.\\n\\nCan anyone say\\, 'Babylon 5 season five'...?","true":true}
