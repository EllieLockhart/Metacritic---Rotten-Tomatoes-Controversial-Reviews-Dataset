Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The visuals\\, acting\\, and music were good\\, as with most Star Wars movies. But the writing was so horrible... so horrible...  In the original trilogy\\, Princess Leah was set up as a princess\\, then turned it on it's head by kicking butt\\, then developed an emotional connection to the other equally able heroes. That's called a character arc.  Strong female characters are welcome... however\\, to push a political agenda\\, it's an insult to women everywhere who've ever accomplished a difficult goal. Rey instantly achieves anything she tries without coaching\\, without help\\, without guidance and is better than Luke and Vader put together after they had training\\, and a better pilot than Han Solo even though she just recently left a planet on her first ever starship.  The message to girls is... you don't have to overcome obstacles\\, work hard\\, or take help from anyone\\, you should expect to be better than anyone at anything without ever trying.  To achieve this insane message\\, the movie gutted all the other characters and killed the entire point of the whole first movie\\, which was that Luke was this special destination at the end of a special map that Luke apparently had some part in creating...   did Luke even leave the planet that he failed to train Ben on?  How did everyone just forget where he was?  Why did he take part in providing a map to find him\\, only to be like... \\\"meh\\\" when someone finally showed up?\\n\\nThere's too much wrong with this film to list in even an hour.  I'm all in favor of strong female characters or political points subtly crafted into a film via expert writing.\\n\\nThis film might as well have had a boom mic with Kathleen whomever yelling direction... \\\"Give Rey more powers for no reason... also she should be smarter than everyone\\, even though she had no schooling or parents...\\\"\\n\\nThis is a complete insult to any woman who has busted her butt to achieve something great... It's so glaring and blatant\\, I don't know how women could like this movie?   Just because Rocky Balboa was a guy too\\, I wouldn't have liked Rocky if he fell off a turnip truck\\, threw two punches at a bag\\, and then beat the heavyweight champ and became a brain surgeon without anyone helping him learn anything at any point.  I'd be insulted.  \\n\\nThis movie is the equivalent of having a Shelby Cobra at a car show\\, but covering it in political bumper stickers\\, then being surprised when people are disappointed with what you did to what should have been a wonderful\\, rare\\, and expensive car.  Awful... just awful.","true":true}
