Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a manual on how to direct a terrible movie with all the good cards.\\nIt's amazing how they were able to destroy every single possible plotline\\, every single character development\\, all the pathos or epic creation.\\nSeriously\\, this movie really convinced me to put aside all the interest on how this story can possibly end in the next movie.","true":true}
