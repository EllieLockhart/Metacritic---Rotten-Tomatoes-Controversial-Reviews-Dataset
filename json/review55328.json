Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Literally I'm so disappointed in this movie. Like wtf was this. Like half of the plot wasn't needed. Like someone tell me why the fuck Luke Skywalker turned into an angsty teenager and did absolutely nothing the whole time. How the fuck did Leia survive in space and don't tell me it's bc of the fucking force bc the force didn't do shit for Luke when he got his hand cut off. So how the did it suddenly unthaw and revive Leia. Oh and what was the point of those small ass birds\\, the foxes and the casino scenes like those were so unneeded. And don't get me wrong I love chewy but what was he even there for he didn't do anything. And what was with snoke why introduce someone like that just to kill him off. And then rose\\, oh yes\\, Rose you mean to tell me that you introduce someone like Rose only to have turn into a love obsessed girl with little to no reason like that\\, like no\\, no\\, miss me with that romance bullshit. The only good scene in this whole movie was when Luke pulled a obiwan and yoda combo hit and died on all our asses like wtf. Like imma tell you rn don't waste your fucking money.","true":true}
