Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The force is not strong here. There are nice moments to be sure. At times\\, visually they absolutely nail it. There are moments and characters that resonate and are well executed. But at the end\\, when you check off all of the events that transpired\\, you are left unconnected and uncaring about some of the most beloved characters in cinematic history. Important moments seem rushed\\, which is saying a lot considering a 153 minute run time. The movie almost seems to have been concocted scene by scene\\, with no thought to explanation\\, cohesion\\, or the integrity of what was once the greatest story in the universe. Everyone will see it. It will make a crap ton of money. It shouldn't. Rian Johnson is better than this.....or so I thought. I think Disney has given up on an integral universe with depth and insight into our nature\\, and is settling for just enough to entertain without thought. In the end\\, we all lose. ","true":true}
