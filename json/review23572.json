Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved this movie to bits. From the start it was great. Action \\, adventure\\, humour and some major emotional scenes too. Not so sure I liked DJ though\\, but very pleased with everything else. Great little visual clues and easter eggs everywhere as well as clever hints in dialogue made this even better. Definitely worth multiple viewings.","true":true}
