Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"luke skywalker one of the greatest jedi in the galaxy decided to end the entire jedi order and cut off from the force and wait for death in a island when the galaxy is in turmoil. and why did he do that? because he thought of murdering his nephew coz he found darkness in him. so he made a mistake and blamed the entire jedi order for it and went to the first jedi temple. he stayed there for many years but didn't bother to read the sacred jedi texts. this is not luke skywalker. this is takeing a huge dump on his legacy. i am not saying he should be all powerful. he should be tempted and also fail. but not to the degree where he decides to blame like a teenage girl an entire jedi order for his mistake. this is not consistent with his character. this is twist just for the sake of a twist. so childish.","true":true}
