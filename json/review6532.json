Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Divisive identity politics in a Star Wars movie? Are you joking me? This movie is dated by the ideas of the here and now. It cannot hold up in the future\\, therefor it's not a timeless story as the original trilogy was. Wooden characters although Mark Hamill did a terrific job. Luke Skywalker is Mark Hamill's legacy. For Mark Hamill to act brilliantly on a script that destroyed to a degree his legacy took more courage than I could ever have. Bravo Mark! That is a man of character if I've ever met one!","true":true}
