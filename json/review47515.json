Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What movie did all these negative reviewers watch? This film took so many bold chances and I loved it. The Finn\/Rose story arc was the weakest but overall Rion Johnson took risks and didn't rely on doing what we've already seen. Poe's arc was very impactful. Kylo delivered bettee than anticipated. The conflict Luke has with himself adds new elements to his character. The cinematography for the battle scenes was masterful and provided viewpoint unseen in any other SW film. I'm a bigger Star Wars fan today than before I saw this. Empire still ranks #1 but this could sneak into my top 3 Star Wars films. Wish Rion Johnson would come back for Episode IX but I'm looking forward to his next chapter with the franchise.","true":true}
