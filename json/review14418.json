Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had only a few problems in the area of plot... I shall keep these spoilers under wraps. I enjoyed the movie as a whole and was in awe at times at the jaw dropping magic. See it in the theater and avoid any info on it like the plague. Solid effort 4.5.","true":true}
