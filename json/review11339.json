Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrendous. Where even to begin. None of the characters made any sense.  Luke was just a grumpy old asshole who had to be taught by Rei\\, who somehow knew everything about the force already.  The writer obviously has no concept of what space is! gravity worked to drop bombs from the first ship\\, there was air in space\\, Leia somehow was a trained jedi who could fly through space on her own.  It was just stupid lazy writing I could go on all day.  Don't watch.","true":true}
