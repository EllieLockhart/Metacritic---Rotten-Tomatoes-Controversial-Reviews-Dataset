Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Brilliant movie. I love how it blew away my expectations and threw things on its edge\\, shaking things up\\, and challenging the characters in new ways. I don\u2019t get all the criticism so I\u2019m posting my first review ever. May bump it up to a full 5 stars after more viewings. Had more viewings. Bumped to 5. ","true":true}
