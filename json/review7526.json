Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everyone has already said it\\, but this movie sucked. Way to kill a franchise! I don't know whether the fault lies with Rian Johnson or Disney\\, but I'm going back to the expanded universe books and pretend this doesn't exist. If you want to see future Luke as he should have been\\, read Dark Empire and others.\\n\\nThoroughly disappointed. Mark Hamill was right. Look up some of his thoughts on how they destroyed Luke's character. #notmyluke","true":true}
