Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don\u2019t listen to any of the haters! They just don\u2019t like it because it\u2019s not how they wanted the movie to be. I thought it was filmed beautifully and the story was great. Benicia del Toro was great!","true":true}
