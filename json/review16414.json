Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm so conflicted by this film and the way it was done. There seems to have been great effort to break away from the original cast\\, and back story\\, which is understandable. But I really feel that they have stripped away the heart and soul of the story for the newer characters\\, without delivering enough depth on their characters. There are two many characters or things crammed in for the sake of it and some of the humour is unnecessary at times. The way it has been delivered left me confused\\, underwhelmed and empty. That said\\, there are some really great moments between Ray and Kilo. Ray and Luke\\, but they are not backed up with the surrounding plot or side stories. I want to like it\\, but I'm not sure I ever will. Help us Obi Wan Kenobi - you're our only hope!","true":true}
