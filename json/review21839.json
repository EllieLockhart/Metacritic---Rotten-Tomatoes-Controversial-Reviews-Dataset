Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just had my second viewing and loved it again. The acting is tremendous. When you can\\, pay attention to the quality of the acting in every single scene. There are so many wonderful moments\\, looks\\, glances\\, etc. that really shine through. This time I noticed John Boyega's excellent work during the Crait sequence. \\n\\nAlso\\, I noticed R2-D2 did one small thing in the movie in addition to the Leia hologram scene: During the Crait sequence he was helping Rey scan for life signs.","true":true}
