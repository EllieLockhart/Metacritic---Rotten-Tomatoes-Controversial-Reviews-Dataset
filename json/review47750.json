Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When provided with the chance to add gravity to the protagonist's current predicament\\, the film opts to spend a significant portion of its runtime saturating itself with an overabundance of uninteresting new characters\\, unwarranted political messages\\, seemingly needless side ventures and failed potential.","true":true}
