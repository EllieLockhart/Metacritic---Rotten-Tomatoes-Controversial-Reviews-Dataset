Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Tried too many things without remembering to ever connect us to the characters we needed to connect to. Plot felt rushed and acting was subpar. Tried too hard with the comedy and Finn's character fell flat. The new characters in the movie barely had time to connect with the audience before being rushed into main roles and don't even get me started about that Leia scene. ??","true":true}
