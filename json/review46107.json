Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning. This is not the Star Wars I was looking for. The Republic has vanished from existence over night with no explanation\\, surely the New Republic was bigger than a handful of planets. Snoke appears as if from nowhere & no back story worthy of the back of a cigarette packet\\, before exiting. The seeds planted by the Farce Awakens barely acknowledged & most ignored or the story was as explosive as a dude firework. The character DJ added nothing to the story & perhaps was just added to satisfy the actors ego?! The Mary Poppins moment was bile worthy. There was a mention of God I believe\\, so I guess he\/ she is now canon! Luke is portrayed as a crazy old hermit\\, sound familiar? So much more could\u2019ve been done with Luke in this episode. George Lucas may have been a weak director but his stories & world building were great. His input should\u2019ve been sought. Perhaps it\u2019s time for Disney to end the Jedi & kill off Deadpool while they\u2019re at it.","true":true}
