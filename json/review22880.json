Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Look\\, before I begin\\, I'd just like to say the film was a good ride. One off viewing\\, it's enjoyable for 2 and a half hours (roughly)... but as a fan of Star Wars (games\\, movies\\, extended universe that was entirely thrown into the garbage)\\, I sat through the movie constantly asking... what on earth is the point of all this?\\nAt no point in this film do I believe the \\\"Resistance\\\" should win at the end of the 9th film... The leadership is inept\\, their plans are terrible and I later found out that the reason they are still \\\"the Resistance\\\" is because after the ending of RotJ\\, the Republic they put in place decided that they didn't need a military to stop anything like this happening again...\\nAnyway\\, this film has no suspense in it whatsoever... I actually started rooting for Snoke half way through this film with him toying with them so badly and then they ruin that too with some half-baked ex machina that makes no sense.\\nRose's and Finn's story arc is not an arc\\, it's a disney movie smashed into a Star Wars film that they're just tripping over and rolling down the hill through. It's awful.\\nPoe's for some reason completely disregarded by upper management woman because she decides the best pilot in the ship doesn't need to know that she actually does have a plan\\, thus causing her plan to fail (think about it\\, what caused her cloaking plan to fail?).\\nBasically\\, I get that the concept of this movie is that failure is OK and helps you grow... but these idiots should be dead by now and the only reason they're not is because the Empire is as stupid as they are.\\n\\nEnd point\\, this is a child's\/young teenager's movie. It's good for a single viewing as an adult and then never again cause the more you think about the plot and story of this movie\\, the more it makes less sense.\\nIt's not so much filled with plot holes as it is just a gaping plot abyss and I can tell you I've stared into it too long...","true":true}
