Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Without spoiling anything\\, this movie met my expectations by not being what I expected. There are a few missed beats and sometimes the cgi goes into prequal territory but when this movie wins it wins big. There are so many twists and turns psychologically it will stick with you for days. Mark Hamill is brilliant in his role breaking all our notions of what it means to be a hero. For the first time since being a Star Wars fan I feel like the slate is clean to start fresh--and we haven't even finished this trilogy yet.","true":true}
