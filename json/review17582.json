Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"is not respectful for Jedi\\, Luke and previous JJ Abrams movie. Rian Johson doesn't know what is a Jedi or the force\\, so why he can make a movie? A lot of accion and a long movie is no the solution.","true":true}
