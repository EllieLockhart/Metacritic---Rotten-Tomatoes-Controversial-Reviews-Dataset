Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How on earth this gets a 92% on RT is beyond me. This was a horrible star wars movie and for the first time ever in any star wars movie I was looking at my watch waiting for the mercy ending. \\n\\nHorrible writing with subplots that make no sense whatsoever.  The code breaker space vegas subplot was beyond the dumbest thing ever in any star wars movie. The entire Rey \/ Luke subplot was boring and void of any reasoning whatsoever.  \\n\\nThe director totally botched the Luke skywalker character in this movie and there's no undoing that. The kylo Ren character is weak\\,  I could see him as a minor villian like boba fett but not the main villian. \\n\\nThe final show down with kylo and Luke.... and no light saber battle?  No\\, instead Luke has a conversation with kylo so he can buy time for the remaining forces to escape( weak sauce) and a total misuse of one of the most iconic characters in the star wars franchise.  \\n\\nFor the first time ever I have no interest in seeing another star wars movie. How on earth the next director will recover from this horrible star wars movie is beyond me but you wont find me in line next time around to find out.\\n\\nOh and who paid off all these critics to obtain that 92% rating?  Like the death of the last Jedi.... so dies this star wars fan.....sad","true":true}
