Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Could have been better. TFA had so many questions and this movie failed to answer them in a inventive way. It seemed as they were just null and void. One point that made no sense from TFA was when Leia sent Rey to find Luke and insisting that she should go and by implication there would be some sort of connection but\\, there was no connection made in this film. Luke appears to not want to be bothered but then why did R2 have the missing part of the map in the TFA? I understand creating new characters and killing off old ones but Luke could have been handled in a better way and the connections between him and Rey should have been answered. No cool death for him either was a let down. He also had virtually no emotion upon seeing Chewie and learning of Han's death. They were all close friends.  Snoke is a wasted character in this film and Leia is supergirl? The Rose character was not exciting at all and the chase scene with the space ships should have lasted 10 mins not 2 hours. Effects were great  and the direction was fine it just seemed like there were so many great questions to build on for the new trilogy and there answers were unsatisfying. I'm not sure what the point of episode 9 will be seems like the air was taken out and not much else to do with it. There are only 8 episode films and this one seemed like a wasted opportunity. Hopefully 9 will fix the issues and end the series on a high note.","true":true}
