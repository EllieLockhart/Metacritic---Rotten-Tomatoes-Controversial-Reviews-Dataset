Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a BAD movie with a handful of genuinely amazing moments. The first 30 minutes or so are possibly my favorite in any Star Wars movie\\, I\u2019ll say without spoiling anything that there are some really really cool moments sprinkled here and there. But a handful of good moments do not a good movie make. The second act was such a mess\\, I felt like I was watching a prequel. And that\u2019s one of the harshest things I could ever say about a movie. ","true":true}
