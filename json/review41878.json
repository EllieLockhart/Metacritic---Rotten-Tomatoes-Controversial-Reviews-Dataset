Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is the worst of the 8 main(4\\,5\\,6\\,1\\,2\\,3\\,7\\, 8) thanks to the director and head of Lucasfilm. It's entertaining\\, but doesn't make much sense. It feels like he tried to do too much and screwed everything up with his yes maam attitude. I would say he did it on purpose\\, but he's also killing his own career.","true":true}
