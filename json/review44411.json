Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too much analysis.You can pick holes in it if you want but you can find holes in every Star Wars film... every film...\\nThis is an excellent movie. It's a brilliant Star Wars. \\nIt is the best since Empire. Mark Hammill absolutely bosses it as an aged embittered Jedi. It's gripping. You think you can guess the ending but there are about 5 times you think the film ends and then there more story - which is great. \\nI'm staggered by the low user ratings. Geeky cynics maybe? Watch it\\, you will love it.","true":true}
