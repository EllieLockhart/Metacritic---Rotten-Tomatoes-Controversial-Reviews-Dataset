Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie! The story was written by a first time writer who never watched a Star Wars movie. Plot holes in every scene. looked at every fan theory and did the opposite. Disney does not care anything for this franchise except to profit it from it.","true":true}
