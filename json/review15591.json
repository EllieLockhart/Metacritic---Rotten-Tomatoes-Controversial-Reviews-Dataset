Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved the last jedi. Its an incredibly fresh star wars film that left me reeling in the aftermath of seeing it. Everything I theorized about what would happen in it was wrong. And that's ok. I loved where they took the characters and I can't wait to see where they go. Don't listen to the haters\\, go see the movie for yourself and formulate your own opinion.","true":true}
