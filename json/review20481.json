Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a Star Wars fan for years and had high hopes for the movie. Overall the movie was ok\\, and I was ok with some of the choices the director decided to take. But all of the plot holes and unnecessary parts that were thrown in there could have been left out and made this movie much shorter. They had two years to fix all of those problems. If people would stop sucking up to Disney and the director\\, maybe we could get something better than waiting 90 minutes for some action. The critic's consensus says that the movie delivered the emotion-rich action fans wanted\\, well it doesn't tell you that it come after 90 minutes of nothing.","true":true}
