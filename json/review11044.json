Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hello\\,\\nMy first review! \\nThe Good: The effects and all the usual Star Wars movie crafting are great. Loved the Star Wars throw back stuff\\, such as the dices\\, and the talk about hope.\\nThe Bad: The plot sucks. I don't mind having holes\\, every movie is going to have them. I don't mind unrealistic plot devices\\, again this is a movie about space wizards\\, ghosts\\, and all the rest. However\\, all those elements can be woven together to make a great movie\\, or even one that is intelligent. It is not here! There are whole episodes in the movie that last for 30 or more minutes that serve NO purpose. There is next to no character growth in the film. Rey starts are young learning Rey\\, and ends as Rey. Kylo start as conflicted Kylo and ends as conflicted Kylo. Finn starts as\\, well you get the point. The only character with a arc is Poe. I can forgive some of that to a point\\, but we should have seen Rey grow more. Also\\, on a side note\\, in the desire to insert comedy into the movie\\, they make the bad guys less threatening. The 2nd in command of the bad guys\\, waits on hold while the heroes plan an attack. Seriously. If only they had called up Tarkin the first Star Wars\\, and put him on hold while Luke blew up the Death Star. I have no problem with humor\\, but it serves to make the bad guys look like Keystone cops. At the end\\, there is just no credible threat to the heroes from the First Order.  The only Resistance guys who are in danger are those who are extras. Another massive plot hole is the space chase. It felt like a bad episode of BattleStar Galactica.  BSGs episode about a tracker\\, and so was an excellent episode\\, with a unrelently enemy\\, an exhuaste crew\\, and everyone desperate to save the fleet.  In this we have the same set up\\, a ship is running out of fuel\\, and can't get away. Why they can't out run them\\, or why the First Order cant chase them down\\, is never really explained. If the Resistance ship is faster\\, and they say it is\\, than it should slowly get away\\, and maybe find the tracking device and destroy it. Instead it is a two hour space chase. A two hour slooow space chase. Like stuck in the traffic on the 405 at rush hour slow. This plot device has been done better\\, with a lot more success. It was badly done\\, and made the middle of the movie drag. Also\\, to borrow what someone else said\\, what is up with \\\"I'm Leia Poppins y'all.\\\" scene? Leia the space wizard (I have no problemif they had done it in a different way\\, but it seemed over dramatic) flies back into the ship. It worked in Guardians of the Galaxy because it was played for laughs\\, here\\, not so much. I would have loved for her to yell the line of Leia Poppins. If you are going to make Kylo Renn a joke\\, make the whole thing a joke. For me it was just too much. All of these actions\\, lead to a interesting final act that fell flat\\, due in part\\, to the bad lead up of the 2nd act. It was so bad that I felt relief when Rey closed the door of the Flacon\\, and ended the movie. It was over!\\n\\nFinal Thoughts: Thanks for reading this far. I don't mind a long movie that makes great sense\\, and builds to a great final act. This movie is not it. It is fun seeing Star Wars\\, but there are better Star Wars movies than this one. While I was in the movie theater today\\, I watched as kids chatted through it\\, and others fell asleep. A good movie captures the imaginations of the viewers\\, and not just their money. A great Star Wars movie leaves them wishing for more time in a galaxy far far away\\, rather than wondering why the middle of the movie was needed at all.","true":true}
