Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok\\, let's cut the sh**.  The  93% hast to be\\, it HAS to be\\, from people paid by Disney.  There is no other explanation for correlating what I just watched with that rating. \\n\\\"It was right up there with Empire Strikes Back!\\\"\\nShut up. No it wasn't. You have no idea what you are talking about.  ESB did not have a subplot taking up a significant part of the timeframe that had  *literally* no pay off. Casino planet to get this codebreaker to sabotage the tracker to...suspension of disbelief is officially gone. Nevermind that it lead to nothing- it made no sense.\\nEmpire Strikes Back also had no obvious axe to grind. Minority quota for the good guys but not bad guys? Check.  Animal acitivism subplot? Check. Anti-capitalism soapbox? Check. Beyond being preachy\\, it dates the film\\, considerably.\\nThen we have another pink elephant in the room- Snoke. They had all of this mystery and build up in the previous film(which\\, aside for being an obvious soft reboot\\, was decent). Now- no explanation for it. He gets killed off rather nonchalantly.\\nSo we have poorly developed characters\\, some being killed off for no reason\\, subplots that lead to nowhere\\, underlying agendas and a main story without any real thrust.  Then there is the tone- all over the place. Namely humor where it shouldn't have been that sort of kills the tension.","true":true}
