Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Last Jedi seems to \u202apander to the lowest common denominator with gratuitous \u201ccute\u201d creatures\\, a five minute space commute back and forth from gambling planet to war zone and misc. dead-end story lines. I\u2019m a real person with an honest opinion of this film. I\u2019m not sure why people assume the bad reviews are bots because they seem spot-on to me. ","true":true}
