Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hate. This movie has been made by people full of hate. They hate Star Wars because it is all about family\\, faith\\, courage\\, sacrifice. These true values are the ones they despise. So they tried to destroy everything we loved in Star Wars. They transformed our heroes into failed human beings\\, the villains into bumbling buffoons\\, the women into all-too-perfect Mary Sues without any need to learn\\, struggle\\, fall and rise again.\\nThen they accused us of being mysoginists\\, sexists\\, racists. Truth is that Disney is all of that and even more. They are also hypocrites.","true":true}
