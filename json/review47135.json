Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a load of rubbish\\, clearly just Disney churning out movies for cash\\, the franchise is popular so why not use it to make money..... This movie answers no questions posed in the previous film and leaves the audience wondering what the hell is going on. very poor film\\, if i could give it less than one star i would. Disney are destroying Star Wars..","true":true}
