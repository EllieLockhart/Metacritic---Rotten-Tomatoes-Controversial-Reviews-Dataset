Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson gave a shit sandwich with this stinker of a movie.  So disappointed.  I wanted to see some background on characters that TFA gave us...who was Snoke?  What is Rey's parentage?  etc...instead we follow Rose Rose Binks around and hear her lecture us on animal rights and class warfare.  No thanks.\\n\\nNot a bot or a fanboy\\, just an annoyed lifelong fan who isn't impressed with these new characters and direction this movie gave us.  Save your SJW issues for the voting booth.","true":true}
