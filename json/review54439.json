Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I LOVE Star Wars...but this was a TERRIBLE movie (as others have stated here).  Total waste of time.  I want my money back.\\n\\nLUKE - I get that they wanted to show how Luke had changed but the direction they took him was NOT congruent to the Luke of Return of the Jedi.  \\n\\nLEIA - ummm yeah ok.  So you're more powerful than Mace Windu?\\n\\nSNOKE - So yeah you're so powerful yet...\\n\\nPlot holes (non-sensical fleet chase\\, stupid casino scene\\, Rey's escape).  Trying too hard to be funny with bad jokes and obviously trying to play to a younger audience. The fun and exciting characters from Awakens were not fun nor exciting (Poe\\, Finn\\, Rey).  Miserable child acting from the extras.  \\n\\nStay at home and watch \\\"Force Awakens\\\" - heck I left the cinema wishing I had just watched \\\"Phantom Menace\\\".  That's how much this POS sucks.  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.","true":true}
