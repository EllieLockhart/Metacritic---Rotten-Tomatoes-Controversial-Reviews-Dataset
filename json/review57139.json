Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"'This is not going go the way you think' is absolutely correct.\\n\\nI came out of the movie absolutely dejected. I didn't get the movie I expected. I didn't get answers I thought were coming. I even thought that TLJ was the worst Star Wars movie since the Phantom Menace.\\n\\nBut\\, ive had a few days to think about it and to be honest\\, I've thought about little else.  I didn't get what I expected and that is a GOOD THING! This film could have easily been an Empire Strikes Back clone but they took a brave and different route which on reflection I really love! \\n\\nOk\\, it was too long. A couple of scenes didn't stand up very well but on the whole TLJ gave star wars a much needed kick up the ass! I can't wait for Blu Ray!","true":true}
