Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Zero Respect For the Orginals\\, Never at Any Point Did You Feel Like You Were Watching a StarWars Movie. Completely takes Everything A Full Movie (The Force Awakens) and disposed of it weakly\\, Halve assed and disrespectful. The Whole Plot is a Messy disaster Wait.. there is No Plot... Well the Whole Movie is a Mess Every Character Ends Up where they were in the beginning in the End. Finn and Rose are literally absolute useless and Serve ZERO Purpose. And worse of All Zero respect and dignity to Luke Skywalker and his Rich History. You can't make this stuff up people. Seriously the worse StarWars Movie of all time .","true":true}
