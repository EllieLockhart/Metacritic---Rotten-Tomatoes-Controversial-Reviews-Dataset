Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Major plot holes\\, needless side quest the lacK of narative iS Realised after you see the film and the awe of the special effects subsides and leaves you with the whys on a multitude of levels\\, so much of the vital story from \\\"a force awakens\\\" was ingnored\\, Major characters were done away with in minor ways \\, Half the film was like the last twightlight film were everthing was a dream and no purpose in investing your emotions in. This film is a very sad response to a force awakens  stars given are for special Effects  minus narrative and the ingnorance of plot holes the size of the grand canyon","true":true}
