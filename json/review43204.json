Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This Star Wars installment was exceptionally breath taking in the actions leading up to this movie from previous episodes. This really shows what true cinema is all about I will deffiently be seeing it many more times. The force is strong with this one!","true":true}
