Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best action adventure movies I've seen. And I'm very happy to use this adjective to a Star Wars movie\\, which I did not have any expectations for. Don't mind the low audience score as most of it is due to some groups of mindless haters drowned in nostalgia\\, sexists or paranoid about big corporations like Disney.","true":true}
