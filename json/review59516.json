Entire textures and levels would disappear and some models would be glowing neon pink at times. It never interfered with the game (thank god). It\u2019s not a perfect 10 in my book because of the glitches\\, but with such innovative detailed environment design and one of the most ambitious games in the last decade\\, any tall order like the magnitude of creating a sequel to The Last Of Us is going to have its shortcomings for any AAA studio.
