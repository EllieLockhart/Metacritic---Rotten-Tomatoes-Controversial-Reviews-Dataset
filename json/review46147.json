Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visualy\\, one of the best. Storytelling and especialy a feeling for the right moment for a joke are way of. It was painful to watch the first time\\, it got better the second time since the shock wasn't as bad\\, though it it was still bad.","true":true}
