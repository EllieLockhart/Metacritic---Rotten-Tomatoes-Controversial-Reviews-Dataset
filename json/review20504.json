Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been left very disappointed by The Last Jedi. Far too many plot holes and errors to make it live up to the hype promised to us by critics.\\nIf you like your sci-fi to include gravity in space\\, characters with lesser abilities seemingly better than the masters and protagonists hiding their agendas from their own crew for no explainable reason\\, the film is ok. Otherwise I wouldn't hype this film anywhere above less than average. Overall\\, seen worse\\, but for Star Wars this wasn't great.","true":true}
