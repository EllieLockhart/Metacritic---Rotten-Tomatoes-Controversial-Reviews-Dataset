Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Best Star Wars movie since Empire Strikes Back and arguably the best performance of Mark Hamill's career. Could have done without the time spent on a few of the subplots or Jar Jar Binks-esque humor from time to time\\, but entertaining nonetheless. I'm glad Rian Johnson didn't \\\"play it safe\\\" and recycle old Star Wars plots like Abrams did with The Force Awakens. Force Awakens is very enjoyable too\\, but not nearly as profound as Johnson's take. Give it a decade\\, and the \\\"fanboys\\\" will realize the greatness of Johnson's vision.","true":true}
