Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" at the midnight premiere\\, as I did see every Star Wars movie that was theatrically released since the OT Special Editions. And I'm still angry. This was the most disappointing Star Wars film I have ever seen\\, not even Episode I left this bad of a taste in my mouth\\, despite ultimately being a real disappointment since expectations were incredibly high back then. When I heard they were making a new trilogy with the original cast\\, I felt really elated. After seeing TFA at the movie theater (twice)\\, I felt that while it was unoriginal\\, they still did not manage to mess much up\\, and I was hopeful for Episode VIII. My thinking was that since Disney spent 4 billion USD on the franchise\\, they were going to play it safe for Episode VII to test the waters\\, set everything up and then go into full Star Wars mode by Episode VIII. What I got with Episode VIII was an utter disappointment.  I feel like most of the issues have been thoroughly discussed here\\, nevertheless\\, here are my biggest issues with the film: Illogical\\, bloated\\, silly storytelling (the slowest\\, worst space chase ever)\\, an unwatchable side plot (Finn & Rose) in a setting that felt like a computer game\\, next to no character development. Flying Leia\\, that took me right out of the movie. They wasted the return of Luke Skywalker to the big screen. I fail to see where this was the logical way to go with Luke. The humor was misplaced.On the plus side\\, some of the visuals were spectacular. In my opinion\\, the film would not have worked as a run of the mill sci-fi film. It makes me wonder whether anyone at Disney felt the need to read the script. As for myself personally\\, I will steer clear of any new Star Wars films\\, at least for a good while\\, now\\, before the franchise gets spoiled for me even more. I have zero interest in \\\"Solo\\\"\\, zero interest in an Episode IX. I'm still baffled why - even if they wished to set the scene for new characters - they could not send our childhood heroes into the sunset in a respectful manner. They have all the time in the world to experiment with further sequels now\\, why rush it? And I never thought I would say this\\, but I've garnered new respect for Lucas' prequel trilogy. They were Shakespearean\\, the dialogue was stilted\\, the effects were sub-par\\, but at least they felt like Star Wars and Lucas understood the hero's journey. I just wish Johnson had read Joseph Campbell and stuck to what's worked in the past. A terrible\\, terrible movie\\, and a horrible addition to the Star Wars Saga.","true":true}
