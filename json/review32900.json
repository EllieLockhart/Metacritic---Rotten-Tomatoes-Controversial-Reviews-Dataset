Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Stef C\\, may I ask you a question? What movie did you watch?\\n\\nYou say you are a fan of Star Wars and watched the OT 100 times but it is hard to believe that an actual real fan would appreciate this garbage of a movie.\\n\\nAs a fan\\, didn't you notice that the entire movie was a thunderous slap in your face? Maybe you like being slapped in the face. People are strange...\\nA lot of people don't.\\n\\nYou walked out with a big smile on your face\\, you say? Good for you. \\nThe vast majority of moviegoers went out with sadness and incredulity depicted on their faces. Many were outraged. Many feel depressed still today.\\n\\nWhy did you feel impelled to come here and defend such an abomination?","true":true}
