Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Didn't know \\\"Let the past die...\\\" meant \\\"Let everything you loved about the franchise die...\\\"\\n\\nWasted characters\\, mishandled plot\\, disregard for the previous films (including \\\"The Force Awakens\\\")\\, and just an overall disappointing experience. Some cool scenes but then they wasted their meaning in favor of a politically charged subplot and romance that no one asked for.","true":true}
