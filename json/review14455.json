Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had very mixed feelings. After much thought I decided to give a four and a half rating because in the end of the day motion pictures are made to entertain and I was entertained from beginning to end. I would've done start wars episode 8 differently but they achieved what any movie always aspire so in my works the last jesi will get four and a half stars. I think people are getting too picky and anybody out there now a days is basically born a movie critic it appears.","true":true}
