Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Completely ignores what came before and disappoints those of us that have been waiting for 30 years for this. Looks like JJ and Rian are in completely different universes. Such a huge disappointment in adding an important chapter to this saga\\, for those of you that have kept the flame alive for all of us and new generations this long I am truly sorry and what a horrible entry. What was the point of Force Awakens with this movie? Simply horrible.","true":true}
