Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably the most jarring and hilarious disaster of a movie in all of Star Wars. It's like the director deliberately tried to troll the entire fanbase by picking the most dumb and irritating directions for the film\\, and then deciding the rest by a dart toss. You haven't lived until you seen Carry Fischer's corpse flying through space in the superman pose.","true":true}
