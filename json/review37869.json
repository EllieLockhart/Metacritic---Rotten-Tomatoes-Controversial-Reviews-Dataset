Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Rose\/Finn storyline lost me while I was watching the movie...because the character development on them were so poor I genuinely didn't care about what happened to them in the casinos\\, and wanted the scene to end so I can learn more about Rey and Kylo. Yet when it came to Rey and Kylo\\, very little was learned from them. Rey's background was explained in 10 seconds\\, Kylo's flashbacks were so short\\, I would have liked to learn more about Ben Solo\\, what he once was\\, were did his dark side come from? etc. Please develop the characters better\\, they deserve more than this.","true":true}
