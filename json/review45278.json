Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Upon multiple viewings it settles in that this is a stab in the back to fans of the saga. !!!!SPOILER alert!!!! To make Luke a crotchety old man who despises himself and the order is a betrayal. One of the great heros in cinema history reduced to a man scared of a little girl and emo boy. Whatever. Rian tossed aside the mythology like Luke tossed away his \\\"laser sword\\\" (that's right\\, he can't even call it a light saber anymore\\, yet another slap in the face). There are so many plot holes and problems with this movie but the worst offense of all is that it's not fun. #NotMyLuke","true":true}
