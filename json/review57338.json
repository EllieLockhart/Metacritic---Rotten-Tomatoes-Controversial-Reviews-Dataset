Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is riddled with political viewpoints and PC agenda slanting. If that does not turn you off then the horrible directing\\, lazy writing\\, flimsy plot points\\, gutless acting (Except Mark Hamil....) and insanely stupid narratives might turn you off too. IF FOR SOME REASON\\, you are able to walk past all those warning signs and you STILL have the swagger to walk into this movie\\, be warned that the \\\"critics\\\" have given it a high score and the viewers have not been as kind. Anytime someone tells me a movie or entertainment outlet is GREAT but I cant find more than 50% of all my contacts tell me\\, \\\"Yeah....I saw that. It was ok......\\\"\\, you should be leary.","true":true}
