Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked this film. I thought it was refreshing and unpredictable. It wasn't a total  rehash of the original trilogy (I tots thought it would) or too out there not to be a Star Wars film. (I know most of you might disagree.) The worst thing about the film is that it felt a little long at times\\, especially when it wasn't on Ray and Kylo's storyline but I loved that it made decisions not all films would do\\, especially blockbusters. Like when it had not one but several strong women of multiple ages. Most of all I loved that they took a different approach and made something that was interesting and didn't go the I thought it would.","true":true}
