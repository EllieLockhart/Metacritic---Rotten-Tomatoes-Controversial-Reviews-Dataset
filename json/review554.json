Stupid teenagers and a maniac who will kill them with extreme brutality. I think we all wanted to be in these films. how to participate in them. And finally\\, it happened!\r\rIn UNTIL DAWN we manage each of the eight friends. We can skillfully escape from the dangerous situation\\, and especially to kill some disliked the hero. And it's cool! Each of the eight friends could die. Or to stay alive. It all depends on you. Yes\\, there are pseudo-elections\\, but the Ira carefully conceals them\\, making the game seem more variable. And believe me\\, the replayability of the game high! Can pereproyti game 3 times\\, if not more.\r\rEight friends perfectly played by real actors. Also in the game there is a psychiatrist played by Peter Stormare. His facial expressions are interesting to watch\\, but at the same time it looks so ugly that even more terrifying.\r\rThe characters seem to be cardboard at first. But over time\\, they disclosed.

The story itself is interesting\\, but to learn lore\\, which will help to fully understand the story you need to look for collectionne items - and that's bad storytelling.\r\rUNTIL DAWN is a great game incarnation of the horror film with teenagers. It has everything: a serial killer\\, ghosts\\, monsters. The plot is intriguing\\, the characters are pleasing\\, and acting. The game is not perfect\\, but it should pass. And get ready to be scared\\, because there's a lot of skimmer.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
