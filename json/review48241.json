Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Why are so many Star Wars movies telling the same story? I love the action. I accept that the new generation of millenials need to be catered to\\, but the stories are going nowhere. Fun action movie\\, great visuals. Good acting but the the aftertaste looking back.... bland. The soul of this franchise is lost.","true":true}
