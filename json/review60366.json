Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"In a STORY driven single player game\\, the focus for me is on the story rather than the gameplay. The gameplay is fine if not excellent\\, but the story ruined the entire experience for me. I have never bothered to review a game on metacritic before\\, but i feel like i need to let the developers and writers of this game know they **** it up big time. If you unlike me can look past the butchering of beloved characters\\, then by all means buy this game for the great gameplay. If however\\, you cared about Joel and Ellie from the first game\\, then play the remastered edition again and give this game the middle finger. Subverting expectations is not a great storytelling tool and the writers of this game should be ashamed.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
