If you are not a fan of games like Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls\\, then you will probably hate this game. It has a lot of slow gameplay where you just explore the environment and look for clues.

Even-though anyone can die in the game I feel that the replay value is still not too high.  Once the big twist is revealed it just seems like who dies and who doesn't is not too important; it seems like the end result is roughly the same regardless due to the nature of the plot.
