Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great movie! Luke has great moments as a reluctant legend. Leia has great moments including one using the force. Kylo has a kick bit scene. All the acting is good\\, and every character who appears\\, even for a fleeting moment\\, has nice moments. Very enjoyable. It doesn't have a George Lucas feel\\, but maybe that's good\\, in that Lucas didn't always hit a home run. I look forward to seeing it again.","true":true}
