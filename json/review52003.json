Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After an appalling start where the characters stumble through some awful dialogue and the actors give some unconvincing performances\\, the film thankfully picks up and becomes an enjoyable romp. It's no Force Awakens but its not The Phantom Menace either.","true":true}
