Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted this movie to continue on the path of Force Awakens....but it doesn\u2019t. Clunky dialog and blotted plot seriously hold this one back from staying true to what JJ Abrams set in place. It\u2019s such a shame because this one has so much potential to show things we haven\u2019t seen in the Star Wars universe SINCE Empire but falls short. This isn\u2019t going to be an Episode I rewatch :(","true":true}
