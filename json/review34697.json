Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Critics Consensus made me laugh. Honors the saga's rich legacy while adding surprising twists?!? This was just another shameless cash-grab. Made me feel the same way as I did about Alien 3\\, which was a big middle finger to the two films that preceded it.","true":true}
