Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The production values are quality. Adam Driver's performance\\, in particular\\, is solid. The writing for John Boyega's Finn improved. These are the positives. The major problems are with the story: there is no story. There is incident\\, and the overarching \\\"plot\\\" is essentially one incident drawn out.\\nIt was a surprise to me\\, but at a pivotal moment a little voice inside me wanted Kylo Ren to just do away with Rey. It's not Daisy Ridley's fault. She does a fine job with what there is to work with here. The underlying problem is this: the writers think sympathy alone will attach the audience to characters. Rey has been abandoned; Finn kidnapped from birth and brainwashed (we still don't have an explanation for his self-deprogramming). The newest example is Rose\\, a character who goes in about 120 seconds from despair to fan girl to angered enforcer. That we have no reason to like her is not Kelly Marie Tran's fault\\, it's just poor writing.\\nThe only character developed in this film is Ben Solo\/Kylo Ren. His story sparks some interest\\, although the writers try hard to assign blame for his turning to Luke Skywalker\\, completely ignoring the active efforts of Snoke. Rhetorically\\, it must be the teacher--the adult in the room--because God forbid he be responsible for his own choices or have been actually misled into evil.\\nBy the way\\, God is in the Star Wars universe for the first time. Twice we hear characters utter \\\"Godspeed\\,\\\" including a dramatic moment from Laura Dern's Vice-Admiral Holdo. Ms. Dern's character is a cardboard stand in whose only depth comes from a single line from another character. You sense that her role in the climax of the film was probably intended for Leia in an early script draft\\, long lost to the magic of executive notes. At any rate\\, another character we know nothing of and are given no reason to care for other than she is a member of the good guy team.\\nLook\\, these films are always going to be up against the original trilogy\\, and probably often found lacking in that comparison. I'm not some kind of purist\\, but there was so much possibility here and seemingly little effort to exploit or find any new direction. No depth has been added to these characters after nearly five hours of screen time.\\nGo for the thrills\\, just don't expect a compelling story. I wish there were something more positive to say\\, but this was a storytelling opportunity lost.","true":true}
