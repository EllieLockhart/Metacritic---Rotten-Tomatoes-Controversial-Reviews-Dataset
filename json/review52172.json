Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After trying to watch this movie a second time in readiness for ep.9\\, I couldn't sit through it again. What a terribly written directed and edited production. It makes no sense with time lines\\, plot holes and quips. It goes to show that money alone can't buy creativity\\, continuity and story progression\\,","true":true}
