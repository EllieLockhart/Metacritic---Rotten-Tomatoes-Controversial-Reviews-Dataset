The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The Last of US Part II (TLU2) tries too hard to push liberal\/ \\\"woke\\\" ideologies onto the players that the story of the game itself sucks. The story didn't make sense\\, was boring\\, and was hard to follow. After Joel's death\\, I couldn't care less about Abby yet the game makes you play as her for half of the game and pushes you to feel bad for her and see things from her perspective. But even then\\, I just didn't care about Abby. I just wanted to play as Ellie or Joel. I just didn't care about Abby and playing as her was just miserable.\r\rThe game focuses too much on Ellie and Dina's relationship and kept trying to remind us that they were lesbian and little on the fact that they were in a world infected by a deadly disease. The first 30 minutes of the game constantly reminded us of how lesbian they were. Compared to the first game\\, TLU2 was more like watching a soap opera. There was a love triangle with Jesse\\, Ellie\\, and Dina and Owen\\, Mel\\, and Abby. The story about Lev being trans didn't even make sense. I felt like it was just thrown into the game just to have a trans character because the game wanted to have some \\\"woke\\\" contents. All the main male characters were obviously killed except Tommy. They killed these male characters to promote female empowerment. Joel was made to look like the bad guy in the game.\r\rAbby was masculine\\, big\\, unnatural and very disgusting and unattractive-looking. Abby looks like she's been on steroids for years. This was obviously due to ugly feminists like Anita Sarkeesian who are against women being portrayed in video games a certain way and weak men (male feminists) like Neil Druckmann giving into them because they are desperate for a crumb of **** They are against so-called \\\"unrealistic\\\" beauty standards of Japanese game characters. It's only unrealistic if you don't eat and workout right. By the way\\, Anita Sarkeesian is friends with Neil Druckmann and they met during the production of TLU2\\, which should have been a red flag. The sex scene with Abby and Owen was totally unnecessary. Notice how Abby didn't even consent and one could say that this game promotes \\\"rape culture.\\\" Abby and Owen's sex scene looked like 2 gay guys having sex.\r\rIf Ellie wanted revenge\\, she should have killed Abby while she was tied on the pole rather than untie her. The fact that they had to have a little fight at the end was stupid. Ellie ended up letting her go. So what was the point of the story then? It wasted everyone's time. Joel would've killed Abby for Ellie in an instant.\r\rWhen you go woke\\, you'll go broke.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
