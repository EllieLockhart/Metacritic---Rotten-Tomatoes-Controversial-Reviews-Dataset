Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful. No plot line. Made a mockry of traditional Star Wars principles. Introduced characters for the single purpose of selling merchandise. The only one that could carry her lines was Daisy Ridley.","true":true}
