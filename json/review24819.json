Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My biggest complaint is that the entire story line with Finn going to the casino seemed to largely be unnecessary and made the movie 30 minutes longer than it needed to be.  Some scream sacrilege regarding various things that seem to deviate from the \\\"rules\\\" of the Star Wars universe\\, but I found nothing to be so far out that I couldn't go along with it.  40 years have passed from the occurrences of Episode 4 to now in both our timeline and theirs\\, and if you look at how much our civilization has evolved in 40 years\\, then apply that logic elsewhere\\, it should work.  So I say all of that to say I didn't have any major issues beyond what I previously mentioned\\, and this movie did a good job of making me want Episode IX...stat!","true":true}
