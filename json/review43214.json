Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this star wars movie is almost everything  except a good movie\\, they not just copy a lot of scenes of the original trilogy\\, they made it worse following a cheap and convenience plot with stupid and childish characters\\, the unique character salvageable was Kylo ren who demostrate an advance as icharacter unlike Luke who go against the written in previous movies with a stupid logic behind of his actions even this movie violated a lot of rules of the previous histories\\, this is the worse movie of star wars ever created.","true":true}
