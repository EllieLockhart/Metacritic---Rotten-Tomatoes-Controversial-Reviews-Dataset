Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never seen a movie that destroyed a franchise so much.  The plot is about the resistance\/rebels running out of gas\\, and the first order catching up.  They somehow managed to ruin the Jedi\\, the rules of Star Wars\\, And didn't offer anything in return.","true":true}
