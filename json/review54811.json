Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was a fantastic movie. I loved the diversity\\, the strong female characters\\, and the overall message of the movie. We tend to put our heroes on a pedestal and they can never live up to the image we created in our minds. I loved that Luke Skywalker was fallible. I loved the message of hope and that the fight will always continue in the future generations. The resistance will never die. As long as there is darkness there will always be those fighting for the light.","true":true}
