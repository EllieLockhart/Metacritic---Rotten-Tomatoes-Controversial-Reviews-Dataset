Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The tone was too jokey for its own good\\, and half the movie -the \\\"fuel\\\" storyline- got more absurd by each scene. I liked the characters -even some like rose that got some hate; I thought she was great-\\, I just wish they were placed in a better movie.","true":true}
