Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was incredible. It was visually stunning and kept me engaged the whole time. The acting was phenominal and there are some great moments in the film which I greatly appreciated. I only really have two big gripes: Throwaway characters. The purple hair woman (who's name ive forgotten) and the not-so master codebreaker were both characters who served one purpose and then disappeared promptly. My other issue was the need to have a codebreaker in the first place. It felt like a useless thread that lead no where. Overall I think its a great movie and I stongly recommend it.","true":true}
