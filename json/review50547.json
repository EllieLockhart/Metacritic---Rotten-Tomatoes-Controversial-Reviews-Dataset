Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"20 hours later and I am liking it more and more.  I have been a fan since childhood and have seen all the films first run in theaters.  I used to have my fair share of toys that are now long gone. The only reason I can think of as to why some people seem to dislike it is because it does not answer all the questions some people think it should have. It stands on its own and is well connect to the rest. It is the middle and should not answer and wrap everything up.  The middle does not get the happy fanfare fairy tale ending.","true":true}
