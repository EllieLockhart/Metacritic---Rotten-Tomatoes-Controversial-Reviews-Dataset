Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have lived long enough to have been able to see all the Star Wars movies in the theaters. I remember the emotions associated with each one as I left.\\nIV: was childhood awe struck wonder\\nV: was captivated by the development of the bigger picture of the story\\nVI: was satisfied by the pay-off\\, even accounting for the ewoks\\nI: was a little disappointed by the sillyness of some aspects but happy to be back in that universe and to have the backstory of characters I was emotionally invested in developed\\nII: annoyed at George Lucas of the poorly written and poorly acted chapter but still feeling satisfied as it was at least the Star Wars universe I knew\\nIII: annoyed at George Lucas for the some silliness but\\, again\\, satisfied that an internally consistent story was told with a deepened lore established that gave deeper meaning to the original trilogy\\nVII: satisfied by JJA and his handling of the franchise\\, including new characters\\, if a bit underwhelmed by how similar it was to IV\\nThis brings me to TLJ. Walking out of the theater I was unsettled\\, and not in a good way. And disappointed\\, not because my expectation were not met\\, I am a grown up and can handle that. Rather I was disappointed in the meta-aspects of the movie. Unusual or even startling turn of events that have an internal consistency jibe well with me. Even iconoclastic turns.\\nThis movie\\, though beautiful and well acted\\, was the work of a disrespectful coward. Disrespectful because he took the efforts of decades of actors\\, directors\\, storytellers and visionaries into no account other that for the names\\, trappings\\, and appearances. A coward because he hid himself behind the cloak of \\\"wanting to take the franchise in a new direction\\\" while dodging the hard work of changing course while at the same time keeping internal consistency. Want to kill off Snoke? Do it but don't make it a cheap and meaningless death. Snoke isn't developed enough to understand why it is meaningful\\, or not meaningful\\, to Ren\\, let alone me. Rey is a child of nobodies? Make it meaningful why her lack of meaningful parents is in itself meaningful and important. These things were not done. A easy equivalent is comparing directors that make slasher movies that have jump scares to directors that make horror movies that create dread. The former is manipulating us due to our baser reactions\\, the latter is challenging our imagination.\\nAgain\\, the choices the director made to change the course of the franchise I don't have a problem with\\, it is the cowardice demonstrated by the director in not facing the effort needed to maintain internal consistency built by the works of past creators and the disrespect that that shows to those who came before (including old school fans) that galls me about this movie.","true":true}
