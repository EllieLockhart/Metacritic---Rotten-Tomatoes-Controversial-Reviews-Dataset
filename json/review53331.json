Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Daisy Ridley\\, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher and some of the cinematography are the few shining lights in this sadly dire and laborious film. Bloated with needless plot points\\, forgettable undeveloped 'main' characters (Finn\\, Poe\\, Kylo\\, Hux) and a hat full of 'really?' plot points\\, this film is a distinct shadow of the original trilogy films. Even the prequel films stand up well compared to it. It's sad when you walk out of the cinema having watched a movie from a franchise you've cherished since a child\\, wondering just where it all went so wrong and feeling totally apathetic towards the whole thing. No doubt it will make a bucket full of cash and be a commercial success\\, but beneath that is a studio and director trying to forge a new identity for a beloved franchise\\, but just ending up failing miserably whilst falling flat on its face. This is not Star Wars.","true":true}
