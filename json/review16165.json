Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm giving this movie 1 star\\, thank you for all the beautiful work the artists made for it (y'all deserve 5). As far as the writing and direction of this movie\\, it is downright disrespectful to the lore and characters of Star Wars. The injection of present-day politics into a hero's journey science-fantasy series is despicable. The tactics and reasoning for things are elementary. Last of all\\, Luke\\, who surrendered himself to the empire to hopefully turn his father who had been a dark lord for 40 years\\, decided to kill a child who \\\"might\\\" turn to the dark side? So out of character it hurts my soul.","true":true}
