Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You have LUKE SKYWALKER in a Star Wars movie and THIS is all you do with him? (!!!!) Have him wander around like an old man and not do anything at all? Are you serious? (!!!!) At least Han Solo got a lot of on-screen action before they killed him in The Force Awakens. Poor Luke is TOTALLY WASTED (!!!!) Everyone I know who is a TRUE Star Wars fan DESPISES this movie ... that goes out of its way to DISRESPECT the entire Star Wars Universe and its fans. Very sad!","true":true}
