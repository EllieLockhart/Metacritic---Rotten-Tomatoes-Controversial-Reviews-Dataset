Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILER ALERT\\n\\n\\nDifference here with Star Wars is this. They've completely flipped the script. Force Awakens was too close to A New Hope\\, that we can all agree. But this one leaves a whole fuck ton more possibility for the last trilogy movie. With Snoke's death and Kylo usurping\\, it makes you wonder. Will the First Order truly follow him? Will Rey train the next generation of Jedi to combat Kylo's onslaught? Will the codebreaker be a bigger part of the next movie? Will Luke as a force ghost aid Rey and\/or torment Kylo? Is Rey a Solo\\, Skywalker\\, or Kenobi because we all know the Junker theory is trash? How will this story end? It's left the whole book open for them to weave into a final story. It may not be the best movie of the series (Return\\, easily for me) but this one has a much more open feel as to what they can do going forward. They could have expanded on Snoke more\\, maybe not have that whole Leia space scene.","true":true}
