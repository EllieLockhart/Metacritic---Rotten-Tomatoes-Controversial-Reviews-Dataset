Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie sucked hard\\, and that is coming from a fan who has loved EVERYTHING star wars before it.... let that sink in. A fan like me\\, saying star wars sucked??? This film had no direction and existed to just misdirect  everything established by previous canon and it just dsoes not work!! I will pretend this film doesnt exist. #notmystarwars","true":true}
