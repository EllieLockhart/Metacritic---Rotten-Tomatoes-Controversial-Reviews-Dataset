The thing that almost ruins this game for me is Abby\\, who we are forced to play as for nearly half of the game. The only redeeming part of playing her was the storyline with Lev and his sister. I didn't care about her WLF friends at all though besides the dog\\, and I still do not empathize with Abby killing Joel. The fact that Joel dies at the very beginning is a terrible way to go in my opinion but it made me love the few moments we had with him in this game even more. I don't think Ellie should have let Abby live either. It would still have the same message at the end with Ellie coming back to the farm and no one is there. Overall\\, this game isn't as bad as it is made out to be but it is a letdown storywise to huge fans of the first game like me. Asides from the story disappointing me in some aspects\\, the gameplay is great and the music\\, graphics\\, and voice acting are fantastic and almost justified the price for me.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
