Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A terrible film. From the first ten minutes\\, where the First Order loses its weapon from a Rebellion prank call\\, to Luke's Force Hologram tricking all the bad guys (Meant as a description of their abilities as well as their moral code)\\, the terrible writing is matched by bad acting and tedious special effects. Your time is better spent watching a shorter toy commercial on your TV\\, this one is several hours long.","true":true}
