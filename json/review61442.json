The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"A gorgeous\\, captivating journey that was viscerally challenging in a way I\u2019ve never experienced before. A tale of grief and healing\\, foremost\\, but also a story on the ills of vengeance. How vilification before compassion leads to only more pain\\, more suffering. How we otherize and dehumanize\\, both in gaming and in real life. There are evils and there are hurts\\, but there are no villains. Because this is a tale of the last of humanity\\, clinging to the only fundamentally real thing left to them; each other. Whether that\u2019s through love\\, through hatred. Through grief\\, through joy. Connecting in the shadow of a world that used to be\\, in a people that continue to struggle onward. It\u2019s not about forgiveness\\, it\u2019s about the ladder we take to climb out of grief. A harrowing journey that we don\u2019t always do right the first time\\, because the last step isn\u2019t letting go\\, or even forgiving\\, its accepting. It\u2019s seeing other side; seeing that they\\, too\\, have their own ladders to climb. Their own hurts to bear. Not only does the game express this narratively\\, but through the gameplay as well. Through every single step. Every flinch when our knife slides deep\\, eyes flicking up to us in terror and confusion. Every name we learn and life we take. How we befriend one and kill a dozen more\\, all while the line between enemy and ally blurs. You question every action\\, because they aren\u2019t some ubiquitous \u201cthem\u201d anymore. They are you.  This isn\u2019t just Ellie or Abby or Joel\u2019s story\\, it\u2019s ours as well. We willful passengers cannot make their choices for them\\, cannot alter their course\\, can only guide them along it. It is not something that can be fully realized except through this medium. We are not passive participants\\, like in a movie\\, but active ones. It\u2019s more personal. That makes it more difficult\\, too. It\u2019s hard to feel shame or heartbreak\\, and it\u2019s hard to feel empathy for the one who caused it.This is not a game for everyone\\, but it is in no way a bad one. We are used to these platforms being majority entertainment\\, but this is...this is more like art. And not the New York interpretive bull that finds meaning in  swathes of color\\, but a true snapshot of the human experience. It is harrowing. It is ugly. And it might reveal more about us than we were ready to see. But in the end\\, I believe it\u2019s worth it\\, to connect so fundamentally to others\\, even when that connection is difficult. We get to see these little glimmers of hope in darkness\\, like fireflies. They guide us forward\\, even when so little remains; even when we are swallowed in despair. There is reason to keep going\\, to try\\, even if it\u2019s only for the sake of a memory.   9\/10\u2026 Expand","true":true}
