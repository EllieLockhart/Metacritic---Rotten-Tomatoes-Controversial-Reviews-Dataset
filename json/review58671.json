Ellie & Abby story for revenge was gripping at my heart strings from beginning to end. Those that helped in their quest for revenge got what came to them. Most of them died but that those who survived in the journey are forever marked by that experience. A lesson learned that for those who wish to walk that road. Ask yourself... Are you willing to sacrifice your loved ones and innocent bystanders to get what you want? Ellie learned at the end of the day\\, with all that blood in her hands it wasn't worth it anymore.\rPersonally Abby should have died but she did suffered enough at the end when her friends and lover died... her body was also tortured and abused then left to bake in the sun. Thinking about Lev as well as his actions... loses and torture throughout the story. Abby was the only person he has in this life. Should ellie take that from him? Would she or even Joel be ok with all this? Hard to say but in my gut I knew killing abby wasn't the answer.\r\rStory aside I loved the puzzles\\, safe cracking solving\\, scenery and graphics! The game is very beautiful and polished. 10\/10 a very thought provoking game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
