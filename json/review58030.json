Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Whilst Force Awakens admittedly felt a lot like a re-make\\, The Last Jedi\\, whilst having elements of Empire Strike Back & Return of the Jedi\\, also adds new elements that take the series in a different direction and hopefully means anything could happen in Episode IX. Hopefully it\/they cannot be lazy and follow the plot of episode 6. Last Jedi is emotional and far superior to Force Awakens and rightfully a candidate for the best in the saga (although Empire still holds that place of best for me personally). Although there are still some unanswered questions\\, or some not totally satisfying or to everyone's liking\\, there is still the next film so we shouldn't expect everything to be wrapped up here. If Force Awakens was much like a tribute to Han\\, it can be said that Last Jedi is a fantastic tribute to Luke and contains some of that characters best moments from the series. It also serves as a fitting tribute to Leia\/Carrie Fisher.","true":true}
