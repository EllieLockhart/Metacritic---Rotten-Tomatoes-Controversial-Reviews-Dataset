Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While I certainly have issues with what is quite possibly the slowest chase scene in film history thinly-disguised as a war of attrition (compare to\\, say\\, Wrath of Khan\\, wherein both ships are equally disadvantaged and therefore have to strategize\\, or Empire Strikes Back\\, which solves the outnumbered\/gunned\/run problem with an asteroid field & left-field thinking) everything else completely and totally makes up for it with interest. This is far and away the most visually interesting Star Wars film of the entire canon. Sure\\, the other films have their striking imagery\\, but this the only one I'd call\\, at the risk of sounding pretentious\\, artful. I haven't seen the color red used this creatively since Hero. It really is at times like watching an abstract painting come to life\\, and before you go telling me that's not Star Wars\\, I'd invite you to (re)visit the world of THX-1138\\, Lucas' feature length debut\\, which he himself describes as having an almost abstract quality to its various compositions and structures. These are the kinds of creative risks I wanted from the Prequel trilogy and just barely got by the last act of Episode III. For all the complaints out there about Disney making The Saga too PC\/Socially Diverse\\, I'm happy with the approach Disney is taking in making the franchise grow. There's been an ebb and flow to the series\\, with a strong grip on the ebb before now. There's nothing wrong with that\\, but it highlighted many of the faults and started to feel a bit cannibalistic after a while (you can only take the whole \\\"It's like poetry\\, it rhymes\\\" mantra so far before everyone realizes it's just an excuse to be lazy)\\, so while I may squirm in my seat and groan and roll my eyes every now and again\\, I think back to the ending moments of the People Vs. George Lucas documentary. When asked of the most ardent critics what they'd say to Uncle George were he right there in front of them with his arms wide and both cheeks ready for turning\\, one response was\\, \\\"Give him a great big hug and say\\, 'Thanks for the childhood'\\\". \\nMy point is I'd rather be given something to potentially complain about than be given exactly what I want and risk missing out on something better. To wrap up\\, I liked it better than Force Awakens\\, which was a little too familiar\\, but Rogue One is still the standout by a longshot. In any case\\, can't wait for number 9.","true":true}
