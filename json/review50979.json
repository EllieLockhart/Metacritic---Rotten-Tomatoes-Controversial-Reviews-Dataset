Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute garbage with several good scenes. Lost me when superman Leia flies through the freezing vacuum of space to knock on the door of the ship..... And they just let her in..... Disney fucked up Star Wars.","true":true}
