Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It goes to show just how one sided critics are towards disney\/marvel\/lucas arts. The movie was ok but way to long\\, predictable and the cast had weird chemistry. There were way to many characters and there is a whole Fin adventure for really no reason. Many of the scene transitions were jarring and you would jump from an island to a ship to a casino with no real ark to connect you. I would give it a 4 out of 10 stars. Also\\, much of the CGI and fight choreography was unappealing.","true":true}
