Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke never gave up on the Evil Darth Vader but supposedly gave up on his nephew because he some saw darkness in him.  How dumb. Mark Hamill has every right to go to the director and tell him that this script did not fit Luke's story arch or moral demeanor. Then killing him off at the end with no fight. You suck and screwed Star Wars up.  This is the Skywalker saga and Luke deserved much better. This crap should have been a spin off movie where you can make up as much garbage as you want without spitting on everyone's childhood.","true":true}
