Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILER FREE REVIEW of Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\n\\nRian Johnson has managed to deliver a mixed bag to the Star Wars film legacy. At its peak moments\\, The Last Jedi hits hard\\, emotionally deeper\\, and more thrilling than The Force Awakens' best moments. However\\, The Force Awakens is a far more consistent movie in its execution and scope. The Last Jedi's worst moments are sadly and shockingly closer to the grotesque CGI nightmare of The Phantom Menace. There is a lot that audiences will enjoy\\, while simultaneously boring or confusing them.\\n\\nIt's worthy to note that while The Force Awakens ripped off A New Hope\\, The Last Jedi managed to rip off The Empire Strikes Back as well as Return of the Jedi mercilessly. However\\, it managed to dive deeper into Star Wars lore\\, mythology while balancing more complex character arcs than The Force Awakens' meager introduction to its heroes. \\n\\nThe greatest problem that The Last Jedi fails to overcome is its lengthy run time. I can handle long movies that are engaging and thoughtful or just well paced\\, but The Last Jedi starts off rocky and gets overbearing in the middle. The film ends with a great finale in the last 30 minutes or so with many standout moments scattered throughout. \\n\\nThe issue is that those endearing moments are bogged down by unnecessary comedy bits that are poorly executed\\, excessive CGI detours\\, and obnoxious space warfare that end up as more of an eyesore than they are thrilling. Not to mention the shameless cute CGI creatures shots or thinly veiled toy advertisements for children that serve no purpose towards furthering the plot. In short\\, The Last Jedi could have seriously used a more scrupulous editor to tighten up the entire film with some more clever cuts. It needed to be edited down to the parts while eliding the sections that contribute nothing to the narrative as a whole.\\n\\nThe light-saber battles are excellent and deliver interesting movements and stellar choreography. The cinematography is often gorgeous and nice to look at when there are not dense muddled CGI bogs to visually contend with now and again.\\n\\nThe acting is a step above The Force Awakens\\, while still maintaining weak side character roles. The highlights for me were Rey\\, Luke\\, Kylo Ren\\, Hux\\, DJ\\, and Leia. The worst parts of the film were Laura Dern\\, Snoke\\, Rose\\, Paige\\, Phasma\\, Maz\\, Poe\\, Finn\\, Chewbacca\\, BB-8\\, and the Porgs.\\n\\nOverall\\, I initially hated The Last Jedi\\, but its finale redeems several of its weaker aspects. That being said\\, I cannot forgive The Last Jedi's bloated mass\\, CGI mess\\, and weaker aerial combat sequences. I genuinely appreciated the bonding moments between Luke and Rey as well as the conversations with Kylo Ren and Rey. Among many of the more human and relatable instances in The Last Jedi there are many confusing blunders that could have been better implemented into the movie.\\n\\nI give Star Wars: The Last Jedi 2 stars out of 5 stars from me or a 4\/10.","true":true}
