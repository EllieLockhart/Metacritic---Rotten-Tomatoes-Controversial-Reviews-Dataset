Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left the movie theater feeling conflicted\\, but as more time passed the angrier I got. It was like thinking back at a bad relationship\\, while you were in it you thought it wasn't that bad. As time passed you realised how truly bad it really was. I'm a huge Star Wars fan and this movie really punched me in the gut. ","true":true}
