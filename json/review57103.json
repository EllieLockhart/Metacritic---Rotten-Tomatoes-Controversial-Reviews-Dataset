Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a wonderful second installment. Adam Driver nails his performance as a very damaged\\, complex Byronic character with strong hints of Mr. Darcy. The chemistry between Kylo Ren\/Ben Solo and Daisy Ridley's Rey switches from achingly beautiful to explosive as they play with and subvert the prince\/princess archetype. Mark Hamill turns in the performance of a lifetime\\, showing that just as in real life\\, being a hero isn't all what it's cracked up to be\\, but when push comes to shove\\, we've got to do the heroic thing anyway.\\n\\nI didn't mind that Rose and Finn's storyline did not come to a happy ending\\, but that again injects a little realism. For any adventure\\, even a fairy tale in space\\, to live up to the name\\, there has to be some risk\\, and what risk would be taken in a story where everything goes right? I only wish there were a bit more chemistry between Finn and Rose\\, so I could better anticipate Rose's last- and most profoundly beautiful- line in the movie.\\n\\nAnd because books make people smarter and also make for a better moviegoing experience\\, I recommend the Aftermath trilogy\\, Cobalt Squadron\\, Jane Eyre\\, and Pride and Prejudice. Refresh your memory of regular this-galaxy fairy tales\\, too\\, like Snow White and Beauty and the Beast.","true":true}
