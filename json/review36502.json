Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie could be renamed The Last Time I Care About This Franchise.\\n\\nFar too much humour (or attempts at least)\\, too many plot holes\/conveniences\\, and too many things that were set up in TFA that are either not answered or answered in a way that wasn't fully satisfying.\\n\\nThis was probably the weakest SW movie (not including the SW Holiday Special) and I left the theatre feeling that it could be the last SW movie I ever watch as it didn't leave me with any motivation to want to fork out money for the next instalment.","true":true}
