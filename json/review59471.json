Would I buy this game again if I could go back in time? No ...Would I replay this game? Again\\, No.  After 7 years since part 1 was released\\, the story of part 2 proves to be a convoluted and distasteful roller coaster ride of emotions. ND forces you to play as the newly established antagonist\\, to empathize and bond with this stranger - only AFTER she kills the familiar and beloved Joel Miller. Adding insult to injury\\, Ellie goes on a killing spree to avenge Joel\\, killing hundreds of WLF soldiers\/Scars - only to leave Abby (the character who fueled said killing spree) alive. I understand what ND was trying to accomplish in making this story - the idea that revenge is a vicious cycle that ultimately gets both parties nowhere\\, but the way that they executed that idea was heavily flawed.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
