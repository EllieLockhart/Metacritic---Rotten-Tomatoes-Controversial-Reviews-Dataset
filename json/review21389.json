{"101487":147516,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wish I could give this garbage zero stars. And make no mistake\\, that's exactly what this film is\\, no matter what the glowing reviews tell you. I would greatly appreciate your time in reading my extensive review so I can tell you exactly why this film makes Star Wars\\, from here on out\\, dead to me. \\n\\nAs a political scientist\\, I want to warn that I'll be focusing on criticizing the underlying toxic concepts and agenda that are pervasive in this film\\, rather than the plethora of other faults that have already been pointed out by reviewers and non-paid off people alike. Yes\\, the film is bloated; yes\\, it shares visual and narrative similarities with The Empire Strikes Back; yes\\, it delivers absolutely no character development; yes\\, the plot has more glaring holes than Swiss cheese; yes\\, the humour is completely off and unnecessary; yes\\, Luke Skywalker is ruined and dies because he ran out of Mana points; yes\\, Kylo Ren still throws temper tantrums that try to present him as a nuanced\\, conflicted character but instead fail spectacularly; yes\\, Rey is a blatant Mary Sue; and yes\\, everything about this film is pointless and consequently doesn't make sense. \\n\\nAnd it's 2017: I am no longer impressed with beautiful visuals\\, the technical spectacle of CGI\\, and cool explosions. I never cared about it anyway\\, and now I especially don't because it's a standard of modern filmmaking. So if these are counted among the actual positives of this film\\, that's just pathetic. But I basically want to do a post-mortem and examine why this film ended up being so thoroughly disappointing and is causing backlash. \\n\\nIn my opinion\\, it's because everyone\\, from the creators to the viewers\\, is more concerned about being politically correct than having a thought provoking\\, engaging story with memorable characters and a good\\, emotionally involving plot. It's like this new Star Wars trilogy was conceived in the boardroom of a disgustingly lucrative and intrusive media corporation that has the power to shape people's minds\\, particularly young impressionable ones. Or something. \\n\\nWhen I was eight years old\\, my dad introduced me to the magic of Star Wars (my mom is also a Star Trek fan\\, so I guess I get the best of both worlds). I am now a 23 year old woman who\\, after watching The Last Jedi with my dad\\, can safely inform you that this is the absolute worst Star Wars film ever created. Not only that\\, but it has also single-handedly managed to destroy the joy\\, lore\\, and entire purpose of anything that has happened and will happen in the future in just two and a half hours.\\n\\nI went in to the film with an open mind\\, and without having seen or heard any spoilers. I kept my expectations reasonable. I'd watched a few trailers\\, which mislead me into thinking this was an intriguing\\, exciting\\, surprising film that would actually take some risks. Instead\\, the film was boring\\, confusing\\, pointless\\, and utterly\\, utterly safe. Both my dad and I were massively disappointed. \\n\\nWhat makes me so angry is that this Sequel Trilogy has no reason to exist because it is only systemically killing off beloved characters (to help the \\\"past die\\\"). Not to mention that it spits on the sacrifices of everyone in both the Prequel and Original Trilogies (and the Legends)\\, which makes everything that came before it completely pointless. Anakin Skywalker being the Chosen One? Doesn't matter; look at Kylo and Rey. Bringing balance to the Force? Doesn't matter; the Force apparently self-regulates. Luke being the redeemer? Doesn't matter; he's a weepy\\, selfish\\, broken old man who can't wait to die and that wanted to murder troubled student Kylo as a first resort\\, rather than attempt to even consider redeeming him. The defeat of the Empire and Emperor Palpatine? Doesn't matter; there's the First Order and Snoke. Such disrespect is a betrayal.\\n\\nNow the divided fan base seems to fall into two extreme camps: those who accuse people of enjoying the film as hopeless\\, brain dead corporate cucks\\, or those who accuse critics of the film as offensive\\, ultra right-wing\\, uninformed haters who are making a whole lot of noise about nothing\\, and should just shut up and enjoy the garbage (neckbeards are optional). Neither of these caricatures is completely true\\, but that's why I wish people would be more open to discussing the tremendous harm this film has inflicted on Star Wars simply because it's playing into modern politics. \\nFor example\\, let's examine the mantra \\\"let the past die.\\\" I noticed that this is running theme throughout the film. I originally thought this meant letting go of burdens and moving forward with knowledge and respect for the past\\, in line with the idea that the younger generation carries the torch to a (hopefully) better future. However\\, this film pushes the idea that \\\"let the past die\\\" means not caring about it\\, literally killing it in order to let go of who you are and become someone else\\, apparently\\, with no regard to roots. How fitting for this miserable film. \\n\\nSo just...why?\\n\\nWhat is the justification to \\\"let the past die\\\"? How is it necessary to the lore? Whatever happened to honouring the past\\, and learning from its mistakes? Those who do not know the past are doomed to repeat it\\, after all. Consider this Wired quote:\\n\\n\\\"In The Last Jedi\\, almost everyone is trying to shut down or eradicate some part of their past\\, and you get the sense that Johnson was (politely) attempting to do the same thing with Star Wars itself\\, jettisoning the series' long-running penchant for quasi-mystical mumbo-jumbo\\, and pushing the films toward a more intelligently designed version of faith.\\\"\\n\\nI'm all for this idea of the Force being an intelligent faith\\, except that's not what happens in The Last Jedi. Sorry\\, but the only Star Wars media that has completely succeeded in exploring the Force\\, the Sith\\, the Jedi\\, and introduced Grey Jedi with complexity\\, depth\\, heart\\, and intelligence is the beloved video game Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic II: The Sith Lords (especially with the Restored Content Mod). This game even had a canon female character\\, The Exile\\, way back in 2005\\, the supposed dark ages past of misogyny\\, bigotry\\, racism\\, homophobia\\, and decidedly unprogressive Star Wars. \\n\\nBut since the mantra seems to be \\\"let the past die\\\" I guess this example doesn't count. So what about Rey's parents being \\\"nobodies?\\\" I can appreciate the sentiment behind wanting to subvert the idea of a \\\"grand destiny\\\" and powerful parents who predetermine their daughter for greatness due to lineage. However\\, there are three problems with this. \\n\\nFirstly\\, it doesn't logically explain Rey's massive Force affinity\\, which effectively confirms her status as a hollow\\, unrelatable\\, bitchy\\, uninspiring Mary Sue (particularity because she receives basically no training from Luke). Secondly\\, what was the point about keeping her parentage mysterious? It's like she's a Noname because the director wanted to be edgy and contrarian. \\n\\nIt would also have been interesting to introduce Rey as a new lineage\\, some new surname that would inspire hope in the galaxy. But nope\\, that doesn't matter. Because Identity doesn't matter\\, values don't matter\\, the past doesn't matter. Apprently\\, the Force just picks random people on Light and Dark sides in order to ensure balance\\, never mind that there should be rigorous training and philosophy behind knowing the Force. But that's all in the past\\, right?\\n\\nAnd finally\\, everyone comes from somewhere and someone. Sure\\, Rey's parents were scavengers who sold her into slavery for money\\, which is absolutely abhorrent. But we are not shown who this informs her personality\\, motivations\\, or actions. It's almost a throwaway fact\\, or a massive fuck you to the fans and our interesting theories. Granted\\, people might have also been angry is she was revealed as a Skywalker\\, which then would have been too \\\"safe\\\" but I would rather have that predictable explanation than a dismissal of her Identity. \\n\\nAs Trusted Reviews points out:\\n\\n\\\"The mysteries surrounding Rey's parentage and Snoke's backstory provided theories Star Wars fans have been obsessing over for around 730 days. All three of those themes were apparently resolved-quite literally in one case-with a nonchalant toss over the shoulder.\\n\\nWho even was Not-So-Supreme Leader Snoke? How did he come to power following the fall of the Empire? Do we know him from Star Wars lore? How did he get his claws into Kylo Ren? None of that was addressed.\\n\\n 'We'll learn exactly as much about Snoke as we need to\\,' Rian Johnson said in the lead up to the release. So\\, precisely nothing then? OK. Well\\, you guys had us invest in the character and he turned out to be the most non-formidable\\, inconsequential Star Wars villain ever\\, so thanks for that.\\nIndeed\\, so many of the questions we had heading into the movie were handled in a way that showed a lack of reverence for The Force Awakens.\\\" \\n\\nThis lack of reverence isn't just disappointing. It's damaging Star Wars within its own universe\\, and its real-world cultural impact. All because Disney has a SJW Diversity Initiative. Vanity Fair explains:\\n\\n\\\"With last year's Rogue One and now this film\\, Lucasfilm-meaning Disney-has admirably followed through on its initiative to introduce more diversity into the main casts of its films. That Boyega and Tran\\, who plays a Rebel tech named Rose\\, get an adventure together is exciting. Seeing a black man and an Asian woman put toward the center of a huge franchise film like this is encouraging-because representation matters\\, yes\\, and because it gives a more thorough sense of what a rebellion like this might look like. It's wholly more inspiring to see an array of different faces (and bodies\\, and species) banding together to fight oppression. That's how it should be.\\\"\\n\\nUm\\, according to this reviewer. And The Huffington Post\\, too:\\n\\n\\\" Blissfully\\, it's also the most inclusive: Everywhere\\, people of color suit up alongside the pale faces that have always been predominant\\, opening up the story's mythology to present a galaxy we'd all like to visit.\\\"\\n\\nI would respect these reviewer's opinions more if they weren't blatantly selling the SJW agenda. Representation matters? Maybe as political rhetoric\\, and maybe if you're so far up your own ass that you get offended by all those \\\"microaggressions\\\" in a galaxy\\, far\\, far away. Applying our Earthly politics is unavoidable\\, since politics shapes absolutely everything in life. I have a problem with the neoliberal\\, regressive left agenda being implemented so that all the social problems we are experiencing here must also be applied in space\\, along with the \\\"solutions.\\\" Namely\\, every piece of media must now tick-off diversity boxes for fear of offense\\, because everyone loves to play the victim and demand their particular issues are tackled or else it's the end of the world.\\n\\nIt's funny\\, but I thought a more interesting choice would have been to explore a romantic relationship between Finn and Poe. Perhaps many people would disagree\\, but if we're talking representation\\, why not? It's certainly different\\, and new. And a lot more compelling than Finn and Rose\\, which just comes out of nowhere. In addition\\, not all representation is good. And what use is this precious representation if it literally does not matter to the characters or the plot? Finn and Rose's story arc is absolutely useless\\, and contributes to making the film drag on. Congratulations\\, that's a fine representation of nothing. \\n\\nAs a woman\\, I want to emphasize that I'm also sick and tired of the blatant radical feminist agenda shoved down everyone's throats (and I consider myself a motherly feminist\\, which is a theoretical lens of feminism mocked and dismissed and repressed by Western feminist SJWs). In case there's any doubt\\, consider Vanity Fair's opinion piece titled \\\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi Offers the Harsh Condemnation of Mansplaining We Need in 2017: An eerily perfect installment for the post-Trump era\\\" or Elle's \\\"Star Wars The Last Jedi Should Just Be Called Women Getting Shit Done.\\\" \\n\\nFor the record\\, I loved Rogue One (and so did my dad). As a standalone film\\, it accomplished contributing something meaningful to the lore while making me care about the characters so that the end of the film had all the more impact. Simply put\\, I cared about this film and enjoyed it because I was EMOTIONALLY CONNECTED to the characters and the PLOT MADE SENSE. \\n\\nI don't care about the race\\, ethnicity\\, religion\\, sexual orientation\\, pronouns\\, or any other invented area of offense of a fictional character. I care about their service to the plot\\, to other characters\\, and what they contribute to the lore. Most of all\\, I care if I'm emotionally connected. A good way to do this would be to show me their mannerisms\\, or morals in various situations; give them clear motivations and actions that consistently and clearly reflect their personalities. Then I will care. \\n\\nI don't care about Rey\\, Finn\\, and Poe. I don't care about their adventures. I don't care about The Resistance and The First Order; I don't care about Kylo or his sacrifices\\, or the beautifully computer-rendered battles where nothing compelling is really at stake and the consequences don't matter. \\n\\nIt's all pointless\\, and no amount of representation\\, feminism\\, or diversity will change that.\\n\\nIn conclusion\\, The Last Jedi has no respect for established conventions\\, nor does it seek to balance this with a desire to evolve. It's hell bent on ruination\\, and that's not a universe I want to be part of.","true":true}
