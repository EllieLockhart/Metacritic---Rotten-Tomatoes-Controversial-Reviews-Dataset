Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love Star Wars.  I enjoy many different styles and types of movies in general.  This was a terrible movie in terms of the Star Wars mythology and in terms of a stand alone movie ... really bad.  It's just a terrible movie with big special effects.","true":true}
