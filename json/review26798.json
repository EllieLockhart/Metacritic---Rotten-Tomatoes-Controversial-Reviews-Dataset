Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"On contrary to the critics opinion\\, this is definitely not the best Star Wars movie since 1980. The movie does have some amazing scenes but lacks overall story plot with a lot of Star Wars Clich\u00e9s to please the fans. The Force Awakens was better than this one for sure.  Hats off to the writers for expanding the galaxy with the introduction of new planets\\, life forms\\, expanding the force concept\\, etc.  3\/5 for the movie\\,","true":true}
