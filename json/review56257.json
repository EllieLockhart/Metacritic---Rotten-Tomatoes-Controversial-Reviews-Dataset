Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the best movie I've seen all year\\, and 2017 has has some great films. It's a strange one. It does crazy\\, creative things with the Star Wars universe\\, while also staying true to the legacy. People didn't like The Force Awakens for rehashing a lot of A New Hope's plot\\, but when it comes to Episode VIII\\, there has never been a more different\\, more strange\\, and maybe more wonderful Star Wars story. \\n\\nThe feedback it's getting is divisive\\, but may I remind those in doubt that Empire Strikes Back\\, often lauded as the best of the saga\\, was divisive as well? TLJ at the very least approaches ESB levels of quality with Rian Johnson's excellent artistic direction\\, and\\, though Star Wars will always be ham-handed at times and kinda jenky (it wouldn't be Star Wars if it weren't)\\, it had an incredible spirit to it. Go see The Last Jedi. Prepare for the unexpected\\, and love it all the same. Even for the people who didn't enjoy it straight off\\, I guarantee it improves with viewings\\, despite peoples' shock. And after the sequel trilogy is complete\\, once everyone has acclimated and learned how this middle chapter fits into the series\\, I'm certain that The Last Jedi will go down in history as one of the very best that Star Wars has to offer\\, no matter its imperfections. \\n\\nAnd also\\, there aren't that many Porgs in the film--they're barely in there and fairly enjoyable when they are.
