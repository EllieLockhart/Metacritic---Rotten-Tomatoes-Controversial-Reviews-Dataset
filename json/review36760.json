Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie obviously has some cool scenes and some decent space action. The problem is\\, the movie wasn\u2019t even close to living up to the hype. This movie could\u2019ve been so great\\, showing training for Jedi and sith\\, explaining snooke\\, diving into the knights of Ren\\, better light saber fight\\, and so much but they didn\u2019t do any of this. The \u201ctraining\u201d is a joke\\, Luke\u2019s greatest moment turned into being something lame\\, questions were kinda answered in a really lame and lazy way\\, no clue where snooke came from and they just had other characters doing busy work instead of just embracing that this story is about Luke and passing the torch. It\u2019s a fine movie\\, just reallyyyyy disappointed as a die hard fan","true":true}
