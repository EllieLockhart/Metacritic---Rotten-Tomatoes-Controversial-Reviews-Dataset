Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film had the highest highs of any Star Wars film.  But\\, it was not without it's issues.  The strengths far outweigh the problems\\, but a lot of other audience reviews seem to be caught up in the small stuff.  If you go into this expecting a wikipedia-esque explanation of the questions left by The Force Awakens you will be disappointed.  This film is content to focus more on strong character arcs and stunning visuals than get tied down in minutia.  It has hands-down the best acting of any star wars film and is at once the most serious and humorous of the lot.","true":true}
