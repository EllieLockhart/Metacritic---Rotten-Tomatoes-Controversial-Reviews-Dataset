Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was expecting sooo much more from this movie. After seeing TFA you'd expect an epic follow up but what you  end up getting is a complete let down. The jokes in the movie were too corny and the story was bland. Who or what is snokes? The movie apparently never told you. Spoiler alert: the way luke dies is lame let him go out in an epic battle.  He is a master jedi a legend!!!! This is worse than episode 1.","true":true}
