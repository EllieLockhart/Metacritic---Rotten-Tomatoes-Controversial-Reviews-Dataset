Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What can I say that have not already been said? Not much.\\nPlotholes\\, plotholes everywhere. Non interesting characters\\, poor dialogues and a story that tries to bring the movie somewhere outside the Star Wars universe\\, maybe the KK\/RJ universe\\, I don't know.\\nhow this could happen.\\nDo those guys really thinks they are geniuses? It's like waiting for the kid on the beach to build the best sand castle and as soon as he leaves stomp on it. For no reason\\, just because you can.\\nWhat a shame. \\nThat's the worst Star Wars ever but that's not even a good film. RJ has no clue whatsoever on what makes a story compelling\\, he just want to flatter SJW and millenials ego by giving them everything that they brainlessly shout everyday. So sad\\, this guy will be only remembered in cinema history as the coward who took a s*** on a beloved 40 years long saga.\\nNo Han solo for me \\, no episode IX either.\\nI hope a lot of people will do the same so Disney finally some things cannot be done with impunity.\\nSo long Star Wars it's been a good time.","true":true}
