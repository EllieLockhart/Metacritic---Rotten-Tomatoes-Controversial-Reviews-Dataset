Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The start of the movie had me worried. It seemed like it was going to be a lot like \\\"Empire Strikes Back 2\\\" the same way \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" was \\\"New Hope 2\\\". But soon I was relieved to see this wasn't the case. Most of the action in this movie was superb. Love the opening action scene even if I was still worried at that point that it was starting similar to ESB. The greatest strength and sometimes it greatest weakness is the movie treads a lot of new territory. We see many new things we had never seen or hadn't thought possible in the star wars universe. There were a few missteps but overall I thoroughly enjoyed these new revelations and additions to canon. Some great twists that i can genuinely say I didn't see coming. I think the most critical thing I could say about this movie is that at times the story lines could almost be clumsy at times. I'd like to say more but I can't without giving away spoilers. So in my opinion it was overall a great addition to Star Wars lore\\, that you will likely enjoy as long as your not one of the fanboys stuck in the Original Trilogy and not willing to except anything new.","true":true}
