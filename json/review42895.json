Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was so bad I just had to sign up to say so. Long\\, boring. Forgettable characters\\, they could all die and I wouldn't care. They ruined the original characters too which is terrible. Disney is the Dark Side.","true":true}
