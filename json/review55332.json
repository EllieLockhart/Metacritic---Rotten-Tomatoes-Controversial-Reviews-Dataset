Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Little long but so worth it! Amazing continuation to the story. With outstanding performances from the cast and amazing job by the crew and staff. Perfect way to lead into Episode IX. ","true":true}
