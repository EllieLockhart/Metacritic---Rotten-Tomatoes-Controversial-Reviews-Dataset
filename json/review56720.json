Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie has more failings than positives\\, I will point out the most grievous ones first:\\nLuke Skywalker's character is horribly assassinated\\, every character trait he earned from the Original Trilogy butchered and given to others who didn't earn them. Couple this with every character that JJ set up being made even more bland. There are plot points that go nowhere and just take up screen time\\, instead of developing the characters; to justify them one must go to ridiculous mental gymnastics and start writing the plot for the writers after you've seen the movie. Political themes are ham-fisted without any sign of subtlety\\, it's just jammed down your throat and the film beats the audience over the head with it repeatedly. From a plot perspective\\, this movie is a nonsensical mess that's insulting to the audience's intelligence. If you care about the stories and character consistency\\, you will not enjoy this movie.\\n\\nOn to the positives: It is the most visually stunning Star Wars movie. The music is also on point and there are cute animals. If that is all you care about\\, you can enjoy this movie.","true":true}
