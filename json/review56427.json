Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best thing I can say about this movie is that it is definitely in my \\\"Top 10\\\" of favorite Star Wars films.\\n\\n\\\"The Force Awakens\\\" set up the possibility that this series has more to say or explore within the Star Wars universe. \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" vehemently refutes this by rehashing content without adding substance. \\n\\nAs a stand-alone film it succeeds in being mildly amusing\\, albeit forgettable. As a part of a saga it does a great disservice to the conflict and the characters it's developed so far\\, and not-so-subtly insults the intelligence of people who actually care about that sort of thing.","true":true}
