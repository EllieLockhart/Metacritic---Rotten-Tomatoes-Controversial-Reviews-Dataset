Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To put it simply\\, The Last Jedi is a must watch Star Wars movie. I can count the fantastic development and care put into characters like Kylo Fen and Poe Dameron\\, which count among the best examples of development in all the films that I've seen. The key themes of the film of the film were generally very well done\\, and served to make scenes that may otherwise have been mediocre into ones that only added to and enriched the film as a whole. Mark Hamill's performance as Luke was also a key feature of the film; and while not everyone was pleased with Rian Johnson's take on the character\\, it was to me one of the most refreshing things in the entire Star Wars universe. Really\\, \\\"refreshing\\\" is probably the best word that I could use to describe the film\\, which managed to truly subvert expectations and keep me on the edge of my seat without taking away from its quality. This has me excited for episode IX\\, as well as the films of Johnson's own trilogy\\, in a way that the Force Awakens never managed.","true":true}
