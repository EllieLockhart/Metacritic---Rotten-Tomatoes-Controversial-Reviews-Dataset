Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I actually liked this movie the first time I watched it but have since changed my mind. The pointless dialog that takes up most of the movie the ridiculously bad lightsaber training and fight scene. Also lasers don't ark in space!!! And why are all the space ships so slow!!! This is a star wars movie not a world war 2 movie. Kylo is a terrible  villain and his master was interesting but that got put to an end. Hopefully the next movie will be better but I will probably wait until it comes out on Blu Ray and just rent it. I\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM)ve lost all hope in Disney\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM)s ability to make good Star Wars movies!","true":true}
