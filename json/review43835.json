Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This will be my first and last Rotten Tomato review. But TLJ was such a disappointing movie that I feel I have to warn other fans. TLJ is NOT a continuation of The Force Awakens\\, does not have pace of Rogue One\\, and most of all feels like a pilot episode to Star Wars TV show. I started the movie full of excitement and expectations but as it (slowly) progressed\\, I got more and more (insert negative feeling here). Around halfway\\, I thought to myself that I should watch it as a non-Star Wars fan. Maybe my expectations were tainted by my fascination of the SW universe? That didn't work and even for an average movie goer\\, TLJ must feel so bad with poor plot progression\\, tasteless humor\\, confusing plot lines. \\nIn conclusion\\, TFA left me longing for TLJ. TLJ killed off my interest in the future SW enterprise. Good job\\, Disney.","true":true}
