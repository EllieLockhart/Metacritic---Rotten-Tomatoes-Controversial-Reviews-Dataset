Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If this was a standalone movie\\, sure it\u2019s ok (kind of\\, in a way). But it\u2019s not. It\u2019s part 8 of a 9 part series that started in the 70s\\, and this movie completely ruins the entire direction\\, mood\\, and style of the previous 7 films. Not only does Rian Johnson direct it like he\u2019s never seen any of the other Star Wars movies before\\, he clearly gets lost in his own ego as he attempts to discredit and completely change all that\u2019s come before in an attempt to leave a personal stamp. Mark Hamill himself did not like his own character\\, and Star Wars has now been completely altered. Not even J.J. Abrams can salvage what\u2019s left after this movie ends with next to no plausible victorious outcomes for the protagonists. From incredibly anticlimactic moments that had been built up for two years or more (multiple of these) to completely pointless and time-wasting subplots that literally have ZERO impact on the story\\, to new characters who are boring and forced\\, to ruining existing and established characters beyond recognition\\, Rian Johnson has put the franchise in a horrible situation that they will find hard to recover from\\, especially with only one movie left in the original saga. The prequels\\, with their horrible script and bad acting\\, now look like Oscar winners in comparison. The prequels\u2019 plot was consistent\\, with a specific focus\\, direction\\, and mood. The Last Jedi ruins all that has come before and will leave you wishing we\u2019d stopped at Return of the Jedi.","true":true}
