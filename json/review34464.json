Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back.  Kylo Ren is the most interesting character to ever grace the Star Wars screen and he gets plenty of screen time. Romantic relationships are completely subplot with themes of abandonment and courage clear as day.  A must watch for any star wars fan.","true":true}
