Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie felt poorly pieced together and terribly paced.  Full of disappointments and anticlimactic conclusions which did not meet expectations.  I expected grandeur but were offered a sappy love story filled with poorly timed humor and terrible pacing.  The character's all felt off character and the pacing felt completely off compared to previous starwars films.  Full of redundancy and terrible directing.  How many times does Luke need to tell Rey to go away or Rey tell Luke that she's from the Resistance.  The Snoke build up and death? left me baffled and confused\\, especially the fight scene that came after.  Need I mention the poorly and often forced humor that came around every 10-15 minute intervals? The list goes on.","true":true}
