Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My initial thoughts on the last jedi was one of disappointment\\, let me elaborate\\nPositives on the movie: - \\n\tVisually and technically a beautiful movie\\n\tSome excellent battle scenes\\nNegatives and there are many: - \\n\tRemoving Snoke so early in the movie was a very bad move\\, a strong evil figure was needed in this movie. \\n\tI can understand Luke going down the side of not giving a monkeys about the force due to his failure in training his nephew\\, however when Luke returned at the end to help out\\, the movie was crying out for Luke to kick some butt. Instead we get Luke transporting himself and then passing out with exhaustion at the end of it... not a good way out for a legend. \\n\tWay too many subplots and twists\\, I get a modern day Star Wars need to advance and keep the audience on the edge of their seats\\, but to have this many subplots and twists messed it up too much in my opinion. \\n\tRey and Kylo chatting to each other using the force came across a bit silly\\, not too mention a few other scenes\\, such as the superman flying through space scene and Luke milking the alien.\\nBottom line I completely understand why there is a backlash against this movie\\, the faithful star wars fans have every right to poo all over this movie. I also understand that the franchise needed to take a new turn\\, I just think the turn they made was not thought through fully and came across as a bit slapstick.  \\nMy initial thoughts on the last jedi was one of disappointment\\, let me elaborate\\nPositives on the movie: - \\n\tVisually and technically a beautiful movie\\n\tSome excellent battle scenes\\nNegatives and there are many: - \\n\tRemoving Snoke so early in the movie was a very bad move\\, a strong evil figure was needed in this movie. \\n\tI can understand Luke going down the side of not giving a monkeys about the force due to his failure in training his nephew\\, however when Luke returned at the end to help out\\, the movie was crying out for Luke to kick some butt.
