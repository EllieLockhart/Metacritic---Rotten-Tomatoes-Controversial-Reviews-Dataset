Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson has RUINED Star Wars. There were a few great scenes but over all this is by far the WORST Star Wars movie. Episode VII was great and I was excited to see VIII. After watching this piece of garbage I have zero care to watch IX. It\u2019s like he took everything great from the first 7 and flushed it out the airlock. The treatment of just about every major character is either full of flaws and holes or filled with epic disappointment. It almost feels like Rian Johnson has secretly hated Star Wars his whole life and was able to destroy the Star Wars universe in one movie with the justification that change is needed for Star Wars to grow. Hate to inform you buddy... the franchise is bigger than your pathetic vision. I will not waste my money at the movie theater on any further Rian Johnson #@$shows.","true":true}
