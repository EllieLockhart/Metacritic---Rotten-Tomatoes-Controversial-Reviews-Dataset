Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it. Minor nitpicking gripes with certain jokes that didn't land for me (most of the humor was well done... just a couple jokes were misplaced in serious scenes)\\, and some pacing issues in the first and second acts. Overall\\, I found it fascinating\\, true to the Star Wars universe\\, and the most realistic war movie above Rogue One. I will be seeing it again and again over the years. I expect to be more forgiving of my criticisms and more drawn into the characters than on first viewing.","true":true}
