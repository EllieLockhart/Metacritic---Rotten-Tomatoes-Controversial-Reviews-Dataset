Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Man\\, this was truly the worst Star Wars film. Disney should have called it Star Wars Episode VIII: Deus Ex Machina. That's all this movie is it went beyond \\\"the force\\\" as an explanation to why things happen\\, and just moved into the realm of lazy and cheap plot devices in order keep this grueling behemoth moving for the two and a half hours that it lasts. After destroying the First Order's largest most powerful space station\\, the Republic is now suddenly on the run\\, pretty quick decline\\, huh? What the Hell happened? Snoke\\, someone they built up as a mysterious overlord is thrown away in five minutes. Kylo is whiny and unlikeable\\, and the First Order sure does have ships that have convenient weaknesses. The last fight between Luke and Kylo looks hilariously bad\\, it looks like they're standing in front of Windows 95 screensavers. Rian Johnson truly proves that he is a poor writer and director.","true":true}
