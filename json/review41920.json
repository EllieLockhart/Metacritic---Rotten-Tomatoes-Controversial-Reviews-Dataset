Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is worse than bad.  This isn't just a bad Star Wars movie that destroys the legacy of some of the most beloved Star Wars characters like Luke and General Ackbar - it has bad writing\\, glaring plot holes and it treats the audience like idiots (like when Princess Leia floats like Marry Poppins through space with no force training through a door seemingly unaffected by the vacuum of space).\\n\\nI could go on and on for an hour about how terrible this movie was.  It will be a dated movie that people will not relate to in 10 years time unlike the heroic struggle that was the original three movies.","true":true}
