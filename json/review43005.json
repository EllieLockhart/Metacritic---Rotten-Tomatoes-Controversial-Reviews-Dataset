Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was the worse i have seen. The new characters have no meaning. There is no connection to them. The legacy characters were treated like a joke. There was no meaning to the story. I felt like i walked out of a joke of what was my role model as a child. There was no reason for me to waste money on this movie. I will not waste any more money on this movie. If you grow up loving Luke and Liea DO NOT GO SEE THIS MOVIE. Having Liea become a flying joke was a slap in the face. Having Luke become a joke of who he was. That was b.s. to the max. So no this movie us not wroth your time or money.","true":true}
