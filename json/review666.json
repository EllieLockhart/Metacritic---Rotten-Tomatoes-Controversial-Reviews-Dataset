If you like story driven games and horror movies\\, then this game is right up your alley.\r\rThe game follows eight teens in a chalet in the mountains after an accident that happened there last year. The game takes a lot time in the first couple of chapters to establish their roles and personalities\\, up until the point where it gets a bit redundant. This is about the only major complaint that I have with this game right next to the other minor issue this game has; some characters have \\\"plot protection\\\".\r\rBut once the developers take the brakes off\\, it's on. Non-stop tension and mindgames being played on the gamer. You can live your slasher dream and dispose of the teens one by one\\, or try your best to keep them all alive for the happy ending. Either way you go\\, the game doesn't fail to entertain.\r\rThe production values are top notch. Graphics look amazing. The actors were on the money with their roles and were extremely believable. E.g. the character everyone hates\\, but outshines them all\\, Emily.\r\rUntil Dawn might not be a gamers game\\, but I won't deny that a had a fun time with it. It's a fun slasher that will go down in the books as one of the PS4's pleasant surprises.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
