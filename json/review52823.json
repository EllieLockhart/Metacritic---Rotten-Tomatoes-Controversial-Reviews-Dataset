Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A lot of people are judging this movie by its affect to the Star Wars canon when we don't really know how it will affect it. There is one more episode left for the sequel trilogy to end\\, yet people somehow already know that this is \\\"the death of Star Wars\\\". I enjoyed it for what it is\\, a fun and well made movie.","true":true}
