Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ is one of the worst Star Wars film. All parts of this movie felt forced and created to make the story\\, IE Luke \\\"attempting\\\" to kill Ben Solo when he was younger because he may be evil. Like redeemed Darth Vader\\, who has killed many people and Jedi\\, no way Luke Attempts to kill Kylo.\\n\\nThe while side plot with rose and Finn was a waste of time and did nothing for the story. Leia uses the force to save herself from space\\, when she's never trained (on screen before). \\n\\nSnoke was killed very easily\\, but with no direction\\, how do you expect Kylo to be supreme leader? He can barely keep up with an untrained Rey.\\n\\nThe positives were the battle in the throne room and the battle between Luke and Kylo on the salt plains. Then we come to realize Luke cowered on his planet and then dies. Waste of an actor and plot. \\n\\nOverall\\, this movie is not very good.","true":true}
