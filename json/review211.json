The story is so good\\, better than any other story I've experienced. It's like watching a thriller. On the other hand there is a lot of humour and the sub stories......the sub stories. Wow\\, they are sometimes very corny\\, but oh so nice play.\rThe mini games: bowling\\, batting\\, betting\\, Outrun\\, Claw contraption game\\, Mahjong\\, darts\\, pool.... They are worth buying the game for alone. And...there are erotic video's lol. I couldn't believe it. For some reason these video's fit perfectly into the game without being distasteful. Only at chapter 5 (13\/14 chapters?)\\, and it's getting better and better. At least a hundred hours of fun in this game.\rThe fighting: this is a main part of the game\\, and it's incredibly fun\\, and has a lot of depth.\rThis is a game which will appeal to a very wide gaming audience\\, in spite of it's \\\"niche\\\" history.\rEnough written\\, time to get back to the game!\rTake care.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
