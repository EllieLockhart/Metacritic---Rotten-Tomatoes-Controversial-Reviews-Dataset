Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just when you expect the usual way\\, it turns and left you happily surprised. Still it retains many similarities to the usual roles (Poe\/Han Solo\\, each flirting with the female star of the episode- Kylo Ren\/ Dark Vader\\, both tormented and getting to their way\\, the dark way\\, after being betrayed and not trusted by their loved ones\\, etc).  Great Rose and Luke.","true":true}
