Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let me just preface this by saying that I thought The Force Awakens and Rogue One were fine\/good. I didn't leave the theatre feeling like I had thrown up in my mouth multiple times like I did with the Last Jedi. The writing and story line were so incredibly cheesy. I just couldn't get over it\\, it was like the writer and director had never seen a Star Wars movie in their lives. Totally different feel from The Force Awakens and Rogue One. Very\\, very\\, very disappointed in this movie\\, it sucks!","true":true}
