Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I signed up just to review this movie. THAT sucked. It is obvious at this point the art of story telling is gone and replaced with special effects\\, liberal sensitivities\\, and agendas. They should have titled it \\\"Star Wars: Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\\". Damn propaganda film. I wont be seeing anymore Star Wars films.","true":true}
