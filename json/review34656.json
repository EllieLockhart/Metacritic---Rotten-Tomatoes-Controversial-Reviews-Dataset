Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The cinematography was great. The main performances by Leia and Luke were wonderful. That big fight scene at the end\\, wonderful. But...everything else was lackluster\\, if not insulting to fans of the series. A faint retread of Empire Strikes Back but with none of the fun aspects of The Force Awakens. An ignoble\\, worthless end to Luke\\, who goes out like a WUSS\\, as badly as Han did. A worthless Canto Bight scene. An obvious betrayal I saw coming from a mile away. Waste of Captain Phasma. Luke barely does anything. It was like being slapped in the face over and over. Subversion of expectations isn't always a good thing.","true":true}
