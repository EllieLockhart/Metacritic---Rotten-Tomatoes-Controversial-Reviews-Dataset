Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was rich in Star Wars lore\\, while at the same time flipping everything we thought we knew on it's head. It had me on the she of my seat laughing\\, in suspense\\, and emotional. Rian Johnson did a fantastic job. I welcomed the changes to the Star Wats status quo\\, and I'm excited to see what Johnson can bring us in his future new Star Wars trilogy.","true":true}
