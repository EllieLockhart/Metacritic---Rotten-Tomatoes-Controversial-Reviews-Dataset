Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson managed it to destroy the new trilogy\\, as a whole single-handedly with one shitty movie. It is very sad to see\\, how a movie this bad and with that many lazy answers and unsolved plot holes can surpass the creative board of disney and lucasfilm. And even more tragic\\, is the score on the so called tomatometer of 91%. In my opinion\\, this has to be a joke.","true":true}
