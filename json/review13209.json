Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don\u2019t understand all the animosity directed towards this film. It has everything you want in a great film; numerous surprises\\, great acting\\, and a sound track that sucks you in. I have been a Star Wars fan for a very long time\\, and in my humble opinion\\, The Last Jedi is the best one yet and I cannot wait for the next installment. ","true":true}
