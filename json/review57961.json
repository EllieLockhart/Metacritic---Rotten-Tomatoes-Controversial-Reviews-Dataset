Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When creating the next Star Wars Film\\, please avoid anything that could be likened to star trek. I hate Star Trek\\, but in a few places........I though Star Trek.\\nSecondly\\, there's no action! Where was the action? I saw ships and walkers lining up for battles\\, then speeches. Speeches! Yes stupid speeches about hope and love. I almost expected a competitive sing song to follow instead of a battle. Secondly there needs to be a better understanding of physics and what you can get away with. We all know there's no sound in space\\, but it's okay to have noisy space ships with on-board gravity in star wars. But people floating around in space and surviving\\, now that's a step too far. Even my nine year old son pointed out they would explode in the vacuum of space. Bombing in space\\, does that work?\\nI don't understand why\\, but I feel like I've watched a strange film about yoga\\, telepathy\\, out of body experiences and not an action film about war in a galaxy far away. It's a complete mess and I don't know if there's any coming back from this. I used to love Star Wars\\, but it's now just daft. For the hocus-pocus bit of Star Wars\\, the producers need to look back to the light sabre fight in empire and work out why that hasn't been topped in later films. Please also consider that in order to make the film believable you need some characters that don't believe in the force and create the possibility that it's just simple tricks and luck. Please lets have some more subtle uses of the force like \\\"these aren't the droids you're looking for\\\".","true":true}
