Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The curse of the sequel. Very disappointing second effort with an overkill of comic relief. Highlight: the complicated relationship between Rey and Kylo Ren- Adam Driver is by far the best actor in the movie Lowpoint: The lame attempts at humor (especially when Luke brushes an attack off his shoulder like he\u2019s Jay-z)\\, the let down if no real interaction between Rey and Fin (Especially when he wakes up and his first word is \u201cRey\u201d) and the plot makes more jumps then the Millennium Falcon. If you are a fan\\, you will see this movie regardless of the reviews but be prepared for a millennial version of Star Wars and say a little prayer that this series didn\u2019t go the way of Transformers.
