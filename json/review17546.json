Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I signed up just to write this review.   I don't have anything positive to say about this movie.  In fact\\, if I had sat down and attempted to write a Star Wars movie with the intention of doing everything I could to destroy Star Wars\\, I'm not sure I could be more successful than TLJ.  Maybe the people that made this  movie actually hate the original trilogy and its characters.  I didn't like TFA\\, so I went into this with low expectations.  I still managed to be upset with how bad this movie is.  I don't intend to give Disney any more money to see Star Wars in the theater.  I think 7 and 8 should be thrown away and start over with Lucas involved in the main story while someone else directs and a team helps with the dialogue and details.","true":true}
