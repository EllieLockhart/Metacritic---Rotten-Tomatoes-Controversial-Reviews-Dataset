Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst of the series (including the prequels).  An awful mess.  Bad script\\, poor character development\\, ridiculous scenarios\\, unnecessary characters aiding in unnecessary subplots\\, poorly paced\\, and anticlimactic resolutions.  Could easily be remembered as the worst of the entire series.","true":true}
