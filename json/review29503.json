Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson is taking Star Wars to new directions. SW8 is\\, without any doubt\\, the most innovative movie of the new sw generation. SW8 is exactly what the audience expected after 7. Johnson is taking a huge risk\\, and it paid of. Sure\\, there are a few problem\\, but none of them destroys the hole movie. The humour is way over the top\\,sometime it feels like a parody\\,and some cinematic decisions are not perspicuous. On the other hand\\, Johnson is focusing more and more on the \\\"Force\\\" itself. He is taking this conflict to a very philosophical level which\\, in addition\\, gives the characters emotional depth.","true":true}
