Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What Star Wars: The Force Awakens may have lacked in originality and depth\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi compensates for with rich\\, bold character development and an exciting new direction for a franchise that risked becoming stale. While a few minor issues have been blown out of proportion by fanboys on the internet\\, the real challenge people have with this film is actually its greatest strength\\, and that is its willingness to break the mould. In a good way. In a great way.","true":true}
