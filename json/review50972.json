Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute garbage that manages to ruin the original series and Luke Skywalker retroactively.  Instead we are left with a new trilogy of boring one dimensional characters who act in idiotic ways to move an incoherent plot full of holes. The only thing 'bravely subverted' by this dumpster fire was the trope of making a good movie.","true":true}
