Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"hated it\\, Rian johnson raped star wars\\, Don't support Disney Star Wars! If no one watches their shit they will stop making SJW wars and fire Kennedy! Luke dying like a bitch was so dumb. Rey is a mary sue","true":true}
