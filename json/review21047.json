Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was really disappointed by this movie.  The movie felt disconnected\\, like a bunch of scenes were thrown together hoping they'd make a movie.\\nThe answers to TFA questions (who is Rey & Snoke) were complete let downs.  Leia's force ability was cool but under-developed.  WTF was the point of mirror scene?  The rebels fleeing at sublight for a planet that the First Order couldn't see was underwhelming and took way too long.","true":true}
