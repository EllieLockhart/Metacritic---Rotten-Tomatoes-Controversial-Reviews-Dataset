Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Phenomenal. I am a true Star Wars fan and I loved this movie. Any of the true fans who hated it probably wouldn't have been satisfied with it regardless. We can't keep expecting to see the original trilogy over and over\\, this movie provided unexpected turns and took big chances and overall they paid off. This is going to rank VERY high on my list of Star Wars movies.","true":true}
