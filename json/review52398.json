Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A great film\\, that only sufffers a bit from the way that humor is pushed on the audience. There is also a particular scene in the film that shows a lack of understanding of an integral concept created by Lucas. This film uses misdirection to toy with the expectations of longtime fans\\, which will get mixed reviews for sure\\, but in the era of Game of Thrones\\, that felt fun and gave an element of surprise to this film. All in all\\, a much better movie that its predecessor which is a tired rewrite of a New Hope with a female lead.","true":true}
