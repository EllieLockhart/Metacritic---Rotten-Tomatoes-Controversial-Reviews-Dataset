Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The original trilogy was rooted in the experiment of executing time tested tropes of storytelling\\, sans contemporary trends or cultural boundaries\\, with the facade of an unrecognizable world.  The facade is quite detailed and marketed for this now familiar world\\, I only wish that equal or more resources were invested into the foundation.  I assert that investment is what made the originals a timeless inspiration to generations\\, not just a good payday.","true":true}
