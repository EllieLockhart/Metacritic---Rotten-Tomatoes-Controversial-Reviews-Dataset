Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Film Stinks of SJW propaganda and empty ideals and morals. No emotional connection to any characters\\, and those who had the potential for some got their balls cut off. Poe Dameron had a chance really\\, but the \\\"Subversion\\\" was laughable\\, pathetic\\, and disappointing.\\n\\nPlot in general has so many holes it would make swiss cheese jealous.","true":true}
