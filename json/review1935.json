Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As long time and die-hard Star Wars fan (since I was 6 years old) this was the worst Star Wars movie by far. It had a couple of good parts like the silent hyperspace jump and the opening scene but it was riddled with plot holes poor acting\\, un-timeless dialogue\\, and a whole bunch on gender\/sex\/and cultural based biases. The were multiple instances where the concept of equality and gender neutrality was forced into parts of the movie that didn't reinforce the plot at all. All of this lead up to a lackluster lightsaber fight. This is a Star Wars Movie for Pete's sake\\, a Star Wars is meant to be timeless\\, something that people can watch 40 years from now and still enjoy\\, not riddled with terrible mainstream jokes and forced social issues. Very disappointed in Disney's direction with this one. It very much shows that a big commercial conglomerate can ruin a potentially great movie. However\\, I am glad that the decision was made to have J.J. Abrams direct Episode 9. I think he did a good job with episode 7 and that he can fix the mess tat was The Last Jedi.","true":true}
