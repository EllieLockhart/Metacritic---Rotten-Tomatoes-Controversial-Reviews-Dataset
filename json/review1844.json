Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As far as plot goes\\, not a lot happens time wise. Characteristically progression was great though. You get to see the characters grow over the course of the movie. I think this movie represents the passing of the torch from the old generation to the new one. I like this movie. If you want flashy action\\, this isnt the movie for you. if you want character progression\\, this film is spot on.","true":true}
