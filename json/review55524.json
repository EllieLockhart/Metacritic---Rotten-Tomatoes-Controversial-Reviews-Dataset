Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Needless plot diversions.  Too lengthy.  Very much mirrored the story of Empire but way worse.  Excessive ill-timed humor that strays from the typical genre mood.  The story didn't feel like a sequel so much as it seems like an attempt to steer the series in a completely different direction.  I can appreciate this attempt\\, but I did not care for the way the plot was delivered.","true":true}
