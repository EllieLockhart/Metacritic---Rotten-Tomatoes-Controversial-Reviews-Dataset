Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you have not seen this movie\\, don't get dissuaded by the fake bad reviews. Ask anyone who you know that has seen it\\, they will tell you it's good. It will shock and surprise you in unexpected ways. It will rank as one of the best.","true":true}
