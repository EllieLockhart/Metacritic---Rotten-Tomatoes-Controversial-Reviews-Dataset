Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie..\\nWorst movie of all the Star Wars movies\\, used to love Star Wars and was really heavy into orgins and extended universe. This movie however takes a dump on Luke Skywalker & Snoke. \\nIts awful\\, little to none character building\\, liked Poe Dameron but tbh he was probably the only good thing about the movie. Luke Skywalker got ruined so did Phasma and Snoke. \\nRey & Kylo story is just a bad as Anakin and Padme's forced love scenes","true":true}
