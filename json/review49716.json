Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Writing should've been for free\\, full of deus ex machinas\\, just one after another with dry humor in between.  Any star wars fan could have written this better.  Maybe the writer was just bogged down being forced to write it with blatant politicizing and over-the-top political correctness.  The film has a consistent dumbed-down feel compared to the older ones\\, too.  Disney-fied all over; not cool\\, Star Wars.","true":true}
