Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't have a particularly high set of standards for the film when I saw it\\, but I really enjoyed it when I saw it back on the premiere. But after I slept on it\\, I realized\\, this film really doesn't lend itself to a good place to go. It has some of the best action scenes in the whole series\\, and some of the best visuals and cinematography\\, but what they did with Luke's character was probably one of the most disappointing conclusions to such an iconic character. I wasn't a fan of TFA\\, and I initially liked this film. But thinking about almost anything about it\\, it seems like its managed to alienate a lot of the people who weren't fans of TFA and those who were. While I appreciate the film for trying to make its 3 protagonists flawed\\, everyone besides Rey really does nothing worthwhile in this film\\, outside of making the problem worse. And even Rey miserably fails in that. If this film was in a quartet\\, outside of the plotholes\\, it wouldn't be too bad. But they wasted so much screen time on the casino scene\\, that almost none of the ideas originally presented in TFA were properly developed\\, and neither was the world of this film. I have no idea what they'll do for the third film\\, because the only plot I can see for it involves Rey killing the crap out of Kylo Ren.","true":true}
