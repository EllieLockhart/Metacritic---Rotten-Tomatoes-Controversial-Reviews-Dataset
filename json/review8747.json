Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For any child of the 80s Star Wars in any form is nostalgic.  If you had HBO\\, you may have seen the original trilogy 100s of times.  The Last Jedi is a throwback.  It's a good feeling even if it may be a bit too long and meandering and not all that original.  Star Wars plays the hits and the hits are damn good.  Final Score: 7.2\/10","true":true}
