Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"THIS IS MY FINAL REVIEW OF LAST JEDI AFTER WATCHING THIS MOVIE TWICE.  THERE WERE ELEMENTS THAT LAST JEDI DID WELL.  IT WAS VISUALLY STUNNING\\, AND HAD THE RIGHT LOOK FOR A STAR WARS MOVIE\\, GOOD SETS\\, CINEMATOGRAPHY\\, AND ACTING.  MARK HAMILL\\, DAISY RIDLEY\\,\\, ADAM DRIVER\\, AND JOHN BOYEGA ALL DO A GOOD JOB.  THERE IS ALSO SOME GOOD ACTION SCENES\\, AND THE LAST 45 MIN IS NON STOP RIDE.  HOWEVER\\, THERE WERE SOME WEAK SPOTS\\, ASIDE FROM THE STRANGE LEAH MARY POPPINS IN SPACE SCENE THAT IS.   I FELT THE MOST WEAKNESS CAME FROM THE STORY AND PLOT.  THE WHOLE SECOND ACT OF THE MOVIE SEEMED TO BE A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AS THE CODEBREAKER IS USELESS AND ACTUALLY ENDS UP DOOMING THE REBELLION IN THE END.  POE ALMOST SINGLEHANDEDLY TAKES DOWN THE REBELS WITH HIS BAD DECISION MAKING.  TOO MANY QUESTIONS FROM FA WAS JUST IGNORED\\, AND IT SEEMED AS IF IT COMBINED BOTH EMPRE STRIKES BACK\/RETURN OF JEDI INTO ONE MOVIE.  FAN DEBATES; I CAN SEE BOTH SIDES TO THE LUKE ISSUE\\, IS HIS CHARACTER INLINE WITH THE OPTIMISTIC LUKE OF THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY?  WHILE THIS LOOK IS INTERESTING WITH THE DARKER CYNICAL EDGE\\, COULD A MORE OPTIMISTIC LUKE STILL GIVEN A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE FAILURE OF THE JEDI WITHOUT BECOMING A COMPLETE RECLUSE.  LASTLY\\, THERE IS THE COMPLAINT OF POLITICS\\, I CERTAINLY DON'T SEE IT\\, IN THIS POLITICIZED CLIMATE IT IS NO SURPRISE PEOPLE ARE READING POLITICS INTO THIS MOVIE\\, BUT THE ORIGINAL STAR WARS WAS ALWAYS AGAINST DICTATORS AND AUTOCRATS\\, AND THERE IS A GOOD MESSAGE THAT ANYONE CAN BE A FORCE USER\\, HEART NOT BLOOD LINES MATTER.  NEVERTHELESS\\, I THINK THIS MOVIE SUFFERS FROM A WEAK STORY LINE THAT LEFT ME WONDERING WHERE THE THIRD FILM WILL GO","true":true}
