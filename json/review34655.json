Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Cinematography was excellent\\, but the plot was horrible and everything else was a kick in the nuts to people who love this franchise.  The movie completely destroyed the character of Luke and the lore set up over the past 40 years. The new ships were horrid and the political tones are not fitting. The boring plot was made worse by parody-esque humor and the worst sub-plot in a star wars movie since pod-racing. Id give this film a total review of 1\/10. Even the beautiful CGI and environments cant make up for this shit bucket of a movie.","true":true}
