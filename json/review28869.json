Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really awful movie. Poor story telling. The way that it all just seems to be one big joke with one liners spread throughout it really takes away from the movie as a whole. I will not pay to see another Star Wars movie again. ","true":true}
