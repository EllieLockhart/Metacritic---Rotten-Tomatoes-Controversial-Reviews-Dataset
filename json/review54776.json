Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It had new ideas while giving credit to the history\\, I'd say this was a great step forward and although it was not perfect\\, most of the ideas were justifiable\\, and the ride was fantastic!!! also to give this movie a 1\/2 star rating is bad reviewing..","true":true}
