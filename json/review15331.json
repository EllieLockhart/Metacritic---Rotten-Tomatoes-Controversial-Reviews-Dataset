Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'll give a half a star cuz it was a entertaining movie but it was not a Star Wars movie otherwise it would be no stars. The whole time time I stay there I was like wtf. And it all started at the very beginning of the movie which was a bad sign for the rest of the movie. The writing was trouble same the directing. I won't be seeing the next one ","true":true}
