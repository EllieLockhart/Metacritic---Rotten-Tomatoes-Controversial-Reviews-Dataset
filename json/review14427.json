{"101487":133404,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-24","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had some hope for this movie originally. My partner hated Kylo Ren\\, I liked the concept of his character being explored and developed. And\\, to this movie's credit\\, it explored Kylo's character and turned my partner's opinion of him to a positive as well. Besides this\\, the only thing I can say this movie did well was in its portrayal of Supreme Leader Snoke\\, who commands any scenes he's in.\\n\\nHowever\\, almost everywhere else\\, the movie falls flat. While my hopes for Kylo Ren were matched\\, my biggest hope for this movie (seeing Luke Skywalker display the full power of the force) was utterly quashed. Asides from one technique employed\\, while impressive\\, Leia uses the force in more overt and potent ways (including pushing open a star ship door). This from the character which took down an AT-AT with nothing but a lightsaber\\, a grappling cable\\, and a thermal detonator at the age of 21. Ultimately\\, what should be the biggest draw to this movie for fans of the original trilogy falls flat and leaves a sour taste in a fan's mouth.\\n\\nMuch of the plot and characters don't make sense. Rey becomes a full Mary Sue\\, displaying potency with the force that far surpasses Luke's display after two years of training with just a month\\, at most\\, of active use of the Force. Keep in mind\\, Luke is literally the son of the Jedi Jesus\\, and realistically\\, has probably the highest potential with the force short of another 'Chosen One'\\, which if they made Rey one would be the ultimate spitting on the series and everything that Anakin Skywalker\/Darth Vader were. The admiral which takes command of the resistance and must lead it through a difficult\\, morale devastating situation refuses to share the plan for how she's going to lead them to safety - even when a captain\/commander and respected hero of the fight privately asks her - instead she takes the time to dress him down for being a glory hound (with the only evidence that he's cocky\\, and willing to risk his life for the Resistance). Fin gets a side kick character that has no personality\\, takes up screen time\\, moralizes to the viewer\\, and ultimately serves to prevent Fin from reaching a natural and emotional conclusion to his character arc (and in the process\\, likely doom the Resistance).\\n\\nAll of this hinges on the fact that the New Republic managed to exist for 30 years with TOTAL military disarmament\\, with pretty much all of their fleet stationed ON PLANET (and not on patrol\\, like actual military craft frequently are)\\, while a hostile\\, expansionist\\, military threat exists on their border\\, allowing the First Order to pretty much conquer the galaxy in at most a month from the last movie. The First Order didn't even need Starkiller Base\\, they could have just walked over and killed the Republic with just having SHIPS.\\n\\nOh yes\\, and apparently Chewbaca is a vegetarian now. Guess the writer's didn't think a race that only had sharp fangs might be carnivorous and would die without protein.\\n\\nIf you're not a heavy fan of the old Star Wars series\\, its possible to enjoy this movie as it does try to emulate the theme and pacing of other blockbusters like Guardians of the Galaxy and the Avengers\\, but fails to actually feel like a Star Wars space opera for most of the movie. But most old fans will be left radiating anger in the theater as the movie destroys their childhood franchise and the characters they came to bond with on screen. The last movie might have killed Han\\, but his character was still\\, mostly\\, in tact. This one completely destroyed the characters that people loved.\\n\\nPS: Yes\\, that was THE Admiral Ackbar that dies at the start of the movie too. At this point I'm just thankful they didn't include a reference with him shouting its a trap shortly before he died. Also it was eye rolling when they included the fat 'Porkins' x-wing pilot dying in Rogue One\\, two movies in a row is groan worthy.","true":true}
