Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wouldn't watch it again. It was illogical\\, and a third of it ended up being pointless\\, which is an incredibly dumb mistake to make\\, even if the movie is a trilogy. A single movie should be able to stand on its own to an extent\\, but this is poopy.","true":true}
