Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is horrible and doesn't feel like a star wars movie. The \\\"humor\\\" they put in misses the mark. The plot is filled with pointless nonsense and has so many holes. It doesn't have any interest in answering any questions or build off the last movie. This is my first review on this site. That is how disappointed I am in this movie.","true":true}
