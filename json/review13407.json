Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed the movie as something I would watch only once\\, and never pay money to see. I loved the character development between Kylo and Rey\\, it gave us a great segway into the last movie of the trilogy\\, but half of the movie was just filler and utterly horrible. Rose is such a horrible character. In the middle of this huge battle\\, she decides to go off task and save some children and animals\\, which could have doomed the rebellion. As a teenage girl\\, her character just felt like a girlish stereotype and honestly made me feel angry. I know there are some strong women in star wars\\, and not every women in the world is as strong as them\\, but her need to go and risk everyone's lives for some stupid animals was just unbearable to watch.","true":true}
