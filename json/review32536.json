Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi\\, directed and screenwritten by Rian Johnson\\, is a mindsore. The film packs riveting action alongside slower character driven moments. Yet\\, the action beats of The Last Jedi fill hollow in comparison to richer scenes. The problem that The Last Jedi makes is that it separates into three storylines. One is fascinating and emotionally moving\\, while another in comparison feels overly simplified\\, and storyline C ends up being pointless in the grand scheme of the film's plot. However\\, Rian Johnson does a great job in weaving these storylines together for an impressive 3rd act. Visually speaking the film is frustrating. Certain special effects\\, computer generated and even puppetry\\, early on in the movie and sprinkled throughout the second act lack authenticity. On the other hand\\, as the movie continues the special effects become breathtaking. Rian Johnson's visual style suits the Star Wars franchise well. For example\\, the way Johnson pans the camera from tight close up shots of character's reactions to sudden moments of villainous triumph is tonally reminiscent of Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back. But The Last Jedi is far from being a copy of that film. Overall\\, the film has a sense of gravity to the film complimented by the various creative risks it takes. The filmmaking behind The Last Jedi is reminiscent\\, at times\\, of an independent film. Because of this\\, the film feels fresh. It is clear that Rian Johnson and the team behind the movie are fans of the franchise. That doesn't excuse the face that I walked out of The Last Jedi feeling exhausted and not as excited for Episode 9.","true":true}
