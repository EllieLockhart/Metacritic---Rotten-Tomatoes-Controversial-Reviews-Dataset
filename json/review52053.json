Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After my first viewing I was severely disappointed\\, but after seeing it a second time today it's really grown on me. This film is surprisingly deep but you need to pay attention to find the hidden meanings. Initially I would have given it a 2.5\\, but after enjoying much much more the second time I would give this movie 4 stars. Would've earned 5 but Finn's storyline was awful and didn't add anything to the plot\\, kinda felt like they forgot about him when they wrote the film so they just tacked it on afterwards.","true":true}
