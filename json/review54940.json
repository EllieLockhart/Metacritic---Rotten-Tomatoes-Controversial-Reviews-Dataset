Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's simple and dosen't try to explain everything\\, just like the OT. The PT \\\"ruined\\\" that and everybody moaned\\, now they don't do that and every body moans. HAHA\\n\\nSNoke is snoke\\, a powerful force user that controls the First Order and Kylo Ren\\, that's it. Just like Palpatine even in ROTJ was the emperor that had force powers and controled Vader and the empire\\, that's it. But Snoke is dispatched without ceremony and the \\\"Vader\\\" of this generation gets to be the \\\"emperor\\\". The Sith are not \\\"explained\\\" in the OT none of it is\\, The Knights of Ren neither.\\n\\nIn ANH Luke was a nobody that was the son of a powerful user\\, Rey is someone that everybody thinks it's linked to that but it isn't\\, or is Kylo lying? In ESB half of the audience didn't believe Darth Vader why should Kylo be telling the truth?.\\n\\nObi Wan was a jedi knight that did nothing except confront vader and become all powerfull\\, Luke just did the same and in a cooler way.\\n\\nIn Ahn there's no reference to what controls what\\, nobody knows the extension of the empire\\, where the throne world is\\, nothing \\, neither on ESB.\\n\\nETC ETC ETC\\n\\nMan \\, this movie is everything a Star Wars fan would want. Almost nothing got explained in the OT\\, just that luke was vaders and leias sister in the second and third movie.\\n\\nI'm really happy they didn't explain a damn thing. This isn't grey's anatomy\\, this is STAR WARS.\\n\\nThe fanbase is spoiled if they want exposition. The emperor never nedeed exposition to be powerful.\\n\\nI may be in the minority but this IS the way SW should be!","true":true}
