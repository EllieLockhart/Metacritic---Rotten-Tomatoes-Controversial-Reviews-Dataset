Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is late to the party\\, but I refused to pay a penny to see this wreck.  \\nIt's as bad as you've heard.  Nothing makes any sense.  The old characters are treated like crap.  New characters are boring and whinny.  The entire universe is ruined\\, it opens questions on why these new made up tactics aren't used in other movies.\\n\\nAll force awakens setup threads are closed with\\, \\\"it was nothing\\\"\\nIt sets up nothing for us to care for the next movie.\\n\\nI find it hilarious that Rian Johnson still thinks he made a good movie.  This is a franchise killer.\\n\\nI may not have thought that prequels were good\\, but I didn't feel like they ruined my enjoyment of the other movies.  This is just the worst.","true":true}
