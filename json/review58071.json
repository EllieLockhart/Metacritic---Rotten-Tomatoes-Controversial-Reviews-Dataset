Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wont go into too much detail. But watching this movie is like finding out your father is a pedofile.\\nTrashes every interesting story set up from TFA and replaces them with wishy washy half resolutions that dissapoint and destroy something with so much potential. Awful unrelenting humour used in every possible scenario ruining any moment of meaning and poignancy. This movie single handedly screeched the trilogy to a halt with nothing learnt and no plot progression from the end of 7. Episode 9 is left with nowhere interesting to go as important key plot threads are completely and unsatisfyingly ripped out with no explanation making a confusing and plot hole filled mess.\\nDont see this!","true":true}
