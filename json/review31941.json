Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoiler - If you loved the original trilogy and how Luke was potrayed\\, you won't like this movie. It is almost like his entire character was changed\\, and they made him weak and frail. Something that was totally different on the previous 3 movies.. \\n\\nThe acting is very bland too\\, nobody really stood out and the movie was quite boring too to be honest. There was 1 somewhat interesting Jedi fight and the rest of movie is really dull. \\n\\nTo clarify\\, I did love the previous movie in this new trilogy\\, but the way they build up to meeting Luke Skywalker and then what happened in the movie was so anti-climaxtic. Probably wont see it ever again.","true":true}
