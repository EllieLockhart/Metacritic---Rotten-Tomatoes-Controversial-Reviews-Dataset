Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Many problems in the narrative. Many moments of incoherence. What a way to waste an interesting villain like snoke. Finn and Rose\\, forgettable characters. Poe is a sea of inconsistencies. The casino scene\\, a failure. The character of Benicio del Toro\\, forgettable. Phasma\\, again forgettable. It is a copy of the empire but strikes back but poorly executed (as was episode VII of the IV). What a disappointment for the fans. The only thing that rescues the film is Mark Hamill and his interpretation. Disney has a very difficult job to close this trilogy with dignity.","true":true}
