Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi was a great movie\\, I'm not the biggest fan of the Star Wars franchise\\, but I still like the check out the movies seeing as they are pretty entertaining to watch\\, the reason may be is that I only like 5 of the Star Wars movies being Episode 4\\, 5\\, 6\\, Rogue One and episode 8\\, while episodes 1\\, 2\\, 3 & 7 I did not enjoy. 1 of the things I really liked about this movie is that they did some scenes I wanted in the Force Awakens and put it in this movie\\, it's like this was my dream of a Star Wars movie\\, although I wish that Han Solo was still alive\\, than it probably would've been my favourite Star Wars movie\\, which it isn't unfortunately\\, however it is still a great movie by any means.\\nThis movie has a great story\\, great set of characters old and new\\, great of old and new cast members\\, great music\\, great action scenes\\, great CGI\\, and even some funny jokes here and there.\\nIf there was anything I'd say I had a problem with\\, it would have to be how long the movie is. Now the movie is around 2 hours and 30 minutes long\\, there are some scenes in the movie that felt a bit too long and some parts felt unneeded\\, I get it's for some character development\\, but it they did it too much. There were even sometimes where the old characters would feel so out of character\\, but not too much out of character.\\nBut aside from that Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a great movie\\, and I consider it to be the best one of the current trilogy\\, seeing as I'm not really excited for episode 9 especially since J.J Abrams is directing it\\, and since he directed episode 7\\, I'm not so excited.\\nI recommend this movie to any fan of the Star Wars series\\, even the ones who are not so big on Star Wars like myself. And seriously\\, grow up over a freaking movie which a lot of people are going to forget about for years until the next set of Star Wars movies.\\nI give Star Wars: The Last Jedi a 7.5 out of 10 a great Star Wars movie but not my favourite Star Wars movie of all time.","true":true}
