Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A few cool moments but the movie as a whole was very underwhelming.... I\u2019ve now watched it twice and I did enjoy it more the second time when I wasn\u2019t wondering what was going to happen and I could just sit back and enjoy","true":true}
