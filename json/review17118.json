Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed this movie. It was nice to see some different ideas in the universe\\, rather than just two hours of nostalgia\\, to keep the \u201cI remember that\u201d crowd at bay. I could\u2019ve gone without all of the jokes\\, and cheap laughs\\, but that\u2019s what sells now\\, so I get it. It\u2019s also nice that Rian Johnson didn\u2019t give in to all the fan theories\\, and made his own movie. Go see it with an open mind\\, and you\u2019ll enjoy it.","true":true}
