Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I watched it twice because I couldn't decide if I liked it or not. Honestly there are some parts that are amazing and strong that I loved and other parts that left my going \\\"that's not how this works\\, that's not how any of this works\\\" (unrelated to uses of the force\\, I read the novels as a kid and I think the force usage is fair in TLJ). If I had to say its a very good movie made by someone that doesn't understand the  Star Wars universe and doesn't have a plan for this trilogy. There are truly stupid moments in this film that pretty much throw it out of wack with the rest of the saga. Its also dragged down by having too many plot lines\\, the side plots are so much weaker than the main plot but they take up a good 1\/3 of the run time. On the plus side I found the performances by Mark\\, Daisy\\, Adam and Carrie engaging and there were moments of genuine suspense. Overall I did enjoy the film but feel it weakens the cohesion of the saga.","true":true}
