Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Eye candy with little to no depth. Plot consists of a string of non-sequiturs thrown together obviously designed by committee for the sake of merchandise and video games. Writers attempt to distract audience from noticing plot holes with overly adorable CG critters. It's a tired recipe that works in other movies of its kind (new star treks and guardians of the galaxy come to mind). Character depth is non-existent with little to no motive behind their decisions.","true":true}
