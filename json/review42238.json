Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie starts off a little disappointing with a few too many jokes to try and break the ice. The Force Awakens is not end with humor and there is no reason there should have been humorous moments in certain scenes at the beginning.\\n\\nHowever as the film continues on and we delve deeper into Luke's troubled past it really picks up. The last hot of the film is truly awesome with some great twists and turns and characters you were not expecting. Don't fully understand the negative audience reactions. Sounds like they need to see the movie again.","true":true}
