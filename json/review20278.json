Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was so long yet nothing happened in terms of plot. If you are a fan\\, like me\\, you will go see this movie and be extremely disappointed in the direction the film takes. It like the director had never seen Star Wars and gave a middle finger to all the amazing fan theories; all of the theories were better than this film. This is the third worst Star Wars film\\, ahead of Episodes One and Two.","true":true}
