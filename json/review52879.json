Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A movie full of fan service\\, incredible scenes\\, great art direction and technically above the level\\, but it's also a movie that has its problems\\, often appearing as a movie of scenes that work well in isolation\\, \\\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi \\\"It delights the most loyal fans of the franchise for its\\\" Ahhhh\\, that's what I wanted to see \\\"moments\\, but in a cooler view\\, we have script\\, rhythm and development issues. The script makes the first two acts of the film look like great fillers\\, because it does not walk\\, the intention was to develop the character of Rey\\, which does not happen\\, we see only 2 acts of discussion\\, thoughts and training\\, everything half played and superficial\\, in the lack of depth of the legendary Luke Skywallker\\, or in the character of Finn who is wonderful in the first film\\, with dramas and dualities and here he is played on a clich\u00e9 secondary mission\\, with a romantic cliche\\, following the traditional journey of the hero that adds little in the movie\\, the only character you notice some development is Kylo Ren\\, even so\\, he ends the film still in a certain conflict\\, we do not feel confident in it. \\\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\\" is a legitimate half-story film\\, a movie that will serve as ground for Star Wars episode IX. The highest point of the film is his art direction\\, which explores a new fauna\\, and features gorgeous costumes\\, extra costumes and absurd attention to detail\\, as well as the classic Star Wars soundtrack\\, the soundtrack is great and not for a second\\, dictating for many times the pace of the scene\\, without fear of open plans or zoom in's\\, the camera behaves very well\\, always trying to bring the maximum of wealth to that world that really gives an impression of being alive and the rhythm of the film's assembly of the one compensated in the pessimo rhythm of the script. The performances\\, which in episode VII are one of the great highlights\\, here are obsolete and cloying\\, but stands out for Oscar Isaac\\, Adam Driver and Carrie Fischer\\, in addition to the great screen presence of Mark Hamill. Finally\\, it's a movie that cardboard fans will love\\, like me\\, and the movie has very good things outside the direction of art\\, such as the exploitation of force and all the symbology that is exposed around it\\, or the bridge of communication that unites the Jedi\\, or even the clean of the past seeking a renewal for Star Wars\\, that renewal\\, which is happening even though it is difficult to detach from the characters of the past\\, and this movie was where it had to happen part \\\"boring\\\"\\, to serve as the basis for what will come. Lastly\\, \\\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\\" may even leave a wish\\, but nonetheless\\, it's an absurdly exciting and entertaining film.","true":true}
