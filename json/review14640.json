Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have invested so much time in star wars over the years...be it books\\, games\\, TV shows\\, films etc and this film has honestly left me shattered. I left the theatre feeling upset with the direction Star Wars is going in and feel like those in charge just do not get what Star Wars is. This film completely craps on everything that has gone before\\, it has ruined one of the most beloved characters for the sake of trying to push on us new characters who they are not bothering to develop. I just like they are purposely leaving plot holes open to give Disney the opportunity to make \\nmore films and ultimately more money...just tell a good story please. A quote comes to mind \\\"before the dark times...before the Disney Empire\\\"","true":true}
