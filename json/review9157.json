Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fun movie. I would say that its one of the better movies in the franchise. Its far from perfect. There was some bad dialogue\\, a lot of forces jokes\\, some plot holes and some stuff that felt unimportant to the story. Most star wars movie have similar problems but that's not really an excuse for them to be there. As a story set in the star wars galaxy and as a continuation of the (still in progress) new trilogy\\, I give it 4 stars. I had fun watching it and will probably go see it again.","true":true}
