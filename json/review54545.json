Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a massive SW fan\\, saw the originals back in the day etc. Had really high hopes for this chapter\\, unfortunately it just didn't deliver. Yes the space battles were amazing as you would expect\\, this is SW after all. However\\, the story arc with Luke just never paid off. Nearky 3 hours waiting for him to come and do something and all we get is a limp confrontation between Ren. Then supreme leader Snoke\\, supposedly one of the great force users\\, went out with a whimper. Killed by a petulant child of a man\\, who had difficulty and in fact lost a fight to Rey\\, in the last movie. Rey who'd never wielded a sabre before. And finally\\, Leia floating through spacecraft. Well... I'm gonna leave that there.\\nThe other story arc with Finn was pretty pointless in forwarding the narrative\\, merely padding\\, which was pretty pointless. In conclusion\\, this was poorly written\\, non-sensical in lots of ways especially in relation to Ren\\, and over long. Ran out of steam after 2 hours. See it if your a fan\\, if only to remind yourself how good Empire really was.","true":true}
