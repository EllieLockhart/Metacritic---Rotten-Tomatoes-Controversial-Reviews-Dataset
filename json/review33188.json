Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such a let down. Luke Skywalker was underdeveloped. The casino scenes were unnecessary and Del Toro's role added nothing. Yoda didn't look like Yoda. It was a mess. There were some good things\\, but the back and forth between scenes and the jumping were sometimes jarring. I didn't feel any emotional tie with the characters at all. Luke's transcendence was ridiculous. I love all things Star Wars\\, but this felt like an experimental film attempting to bridge a gap.","true":true}
