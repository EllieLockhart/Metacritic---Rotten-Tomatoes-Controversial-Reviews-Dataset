Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought the movie was fantastic! I honestly can't believe all the  negative audience reviews. Maybe many of the negative reviewers were simply too stupid to understand the movie. The whole movie was about failure\\, and about change. I'm glad it's not more of the same. It takes the franchise into a new era: no one knows how it will turn out.","true":true}
