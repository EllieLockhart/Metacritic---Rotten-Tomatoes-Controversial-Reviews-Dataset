Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good looking film. Great action. Ruined the future of Star Wars. If it was not part of Star Wars I would certainly think this would be at least a 4 Star from most sci fi fans but they personally ruined it for me. What story have they left for th next one? I certainly would wait to see reviews before blindly go to watch IX (something iv never done with SW before). Also not enough pansexual transgender Mongolian actors in th film and in this day an age it's a JOKE!","true":true}
