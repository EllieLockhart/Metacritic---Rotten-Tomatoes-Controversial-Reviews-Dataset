Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"to all you whiners giving it 1 or no star.\\, get over your nerdy selves. It's a movie for entertainment. if you don't like it\\, don't go.  stop crying like a 2 year old.  it's entertaining for sure.  Epi 1 2 3 weren't.","true":true}
