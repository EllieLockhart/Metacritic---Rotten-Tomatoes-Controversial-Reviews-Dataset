Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a huge disappointment. My expectations going in was high i have to say that( can you blame me\\,Rian johnson is the director\/writer) but the flaw in this sequel trilogy is the lack of creativity and originality. trying to re do the past re do the original trilogy and repeating the formula does not and cannot keep working.","true":true}
