Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to post a real review of Last Jedi.   It was a good movie with significant editing issues that made it too long.   It wasn't what I expected and that's a good thing.    I think many people were missing the point of the movie which Yoda basically tells you and are too focused on the main \\\"plot\\\" which really isn't the plot there are numerous plots for the different characters.   I've seen the movie twice.  I love it but it has flaws.  I'm sick of the 5 star reviews that ignore it.  Or the half or one star reviews that  basically  are just saying it sucked with no rationale. Or worse are a copy of one of the previous.","true":true}
