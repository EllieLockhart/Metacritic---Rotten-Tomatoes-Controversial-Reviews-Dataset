Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think people fall in love with the lore of Star Wars and will give the director and Disney a pass for what they did to this great saga. They are starting to tear it down and put their own spin into the movie. I get it\\, i know characters die\\, but give them a worthy death.","true":true}
