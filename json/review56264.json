Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is unlike anything you've seen before...and that is a good thing not only for Disney but for fans of the long-running franchise. This is a new Star Wars by a new auteur\\, and its freshness is its best quality. If The Force Awakens was a careful retread of everything that made A New Hope awesome\\, this movie is the first Star Wars story to take a fresh and original direction since...well since The Empire Strikes Back.\\n\\nThere the resemblance ends. The Last Jedi is the longest movie in the nine-film saga\\, an epic chase film pinned by the giant battles that are the series' calling-card. Along the way\\, there is death\\, loss\\, laughter and a dizzying array of visual effects\\, and three interwoven plot lines that force the viewer to pay attention and focus as the movie rolls inexorably forward.\\n\\nThe first of these concerns the escape of the remaining Resistance as they flee the absurd\\, huge Star Destroyers of the First Order. This tale of survival focuses on Leia\\, newly widowed and still the general at the helm of her fighters. It also brings us Poe Dameron\\, the cocky pilot (Oscar Isaac) whose growth and road to maturity are a key component of the film. \\n\\nThe second arc of director Rian Johnson's script focuses on the nascent Jedi Rey (Daisy Ridley) and her twisted path\\, which has led her to ask Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) for help. It is Ridley and Hamill whose emotional interplay is the heart of this movie: she learns some unwelcome truths from the man she would have as mentor and Luke himself has to decide whether to fight or continue to retreat.\\n\\nThe third key storyline is the most divergent: we follow Finn and new character Rose as they visit a casino planet to find a hacker who can stop the First Order from tracking rebel ships. On the quest for this MacGuffin (played by Benicio del Toro) we see a different side of the galaxy\\, the side that profits from the mindless\\, endless war between the First Order and the Resistance. This is the movie that finally asks a key Star Wars universe question: where do all those weapons come from?\\n\\nAll those weapons do finally show up on the planet Crait\\, a bleak world ruined by mining and covered with salt. This is where the movie's epic showdown happens but if you want to know what comes next\\, stop sitting here reading reviews\\, get off your fundament and go see Star Wars: The Last Jedi. You won't regret the ride.","true":true}
