Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie ever. I honestly kept thinking\\, \\\"Oh yeah this is a Star Wars movie.\\\". This movie was terrible the worst I've seen in 2017. It didn't make any sense and my uncle and I were ready for it to be over with. I couldn't hardly wait for it to end. Nothing felt like Star Wars. It was just pigging backing off of the original trilogy. The force awakens was too\\, but it was actually pretty decent. The last jedi sucks. Anyway I can't believe it\\, but I might not go see the next one. It just WASN'T ORIGINAL!!!","true":true}
