Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw Last Jedi last night and I may need to see it again to give a full opinion but as for my initial thoughts. It was good not great but good. It had some elements I loved and some that I questioned\\, but I think the parts that I questioned helped expand on the Star Wars universe. There is a few story choices though that fell flat and that's a problem I have but I think that this will fall in the middle of the list in my rankings . I still really like Rogue One and Empire more but I like what Last Jedi adds to the universe.","true":true}
