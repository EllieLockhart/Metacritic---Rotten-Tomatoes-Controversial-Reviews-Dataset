Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"[[Spoilers]] Having waited for such a long time\\, excited for the new Star Wars movie\\, I was\\, like most fans\\, completely immersed in fan theories\\, and giddy to see what they would do to develop the new characters\\, and how they would expand upon the old. Many fans wanted to see Luke in combat\\, or training Rey. Many fans wanted to see Snoke do something noteworthy. Many fans wanted to see a Star Wars movie\\, with it's massive\\, well told story arch\\, and a complex set of events that just so happen to allow the rebellion to live on in some form. What the fans received was a spit in the face. All fan theories\\, were outright ignored\\, which in itself is not a problem\\, until you count in the way they turned the movies instead of towards the theories\\, simply killing off certain characters who where the focus of majority of the theories. Other characters had their story lines destroyed\\, or otherwise negatively impacted. The only interesting thing to happen throughout the entire movie was at the very end\\, and even this display was not enough to use as the final scene for such an important character in the series as a send-off. The plot of this movie\\, was a disgrace. It was the plot of all prior Star Wars movies\\, compressed into one 2 hour film. Many of the event that created the story line were laughable. I mean\\, flying through space? Really? All of the ships being split in half when only one ship was hit? Why? And then you get the message that took place on the Casino Planet\\, which essentially told the viewer that Capitalism is a bad system\\, which only benefits \\\"bad guys\\\". The prior movie\\, The Force Awakens\\, was comparatively\\, an amazing story\\, and gave them so many setups\\, of which\\, they utilized none. The movie was a flop. The critics are biased. At the time of me writing this review\\, the rating is a stellar 49%. This movie has no bearing on what most fans want the Star Wars universe to look like. They destroyed Luke's character\\, changed the cannon on Force Ghosts\\, had characters make blatantly stupid decisions as plot armor. and ultimately\\, the ending was a deus ex machina. While Star Wars movies of the past have had a history of similar endings\\, those were always accomplished by the main character's use of the Force\\, and the light prevailing over the existing powers of the dark. This is the first Star Wars movie to have the end outcome of the rebellion surviving be caused by the absolutely stupidity of an Admiral seeing a ship moving to face towards his massive dreadnought\\, and simply declare that it's empty. The ship was clearly moving\\, and being piloted. To simply declare it empty\\, and ignore it\\, is ridiculous\\, and blatant plot armor used to allow the suicidal tendencies of the purple haired admiral of the rebellion to somehow save the day. This entire film\\, and I hate to say it\\, I really do\\, but this entire film was all just progressive propaganda. I don't want to believe it\\, but there is no other reason that explains half of the occurrences  of the film. This is not what I want my Star Wars to look like. This is clearly not what the fans want their Star Wars to look like. I'd say that the highlight of this film was the love Arch between Finn\\, and that random Asian girl that showed up out of nowhere. The movie was\\, and is a flop\\, rating even worse than The Phantom Menace\\, despite being more modern\\, with a nearly unlimited budget. And look how that worked out.","true":true}
