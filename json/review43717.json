Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the first movie where I came out of the theatre feeling confused and conflicted. I wanted to like it\\, but after thinking about it I realized how bad it truly was. \\n\\nWriting errors\\, breaks in established canon\\, errors in direction\\, lack of attention to detail (eg\\, the ship count and position of the First Order fleet changes from scene to scene)\\, plot inconsistencies between this film and the last\\, plot inconsistencies between this film and the rest of the saga\\, plot inconsistencies within this film itself\\, unexplained established character inconsistencies\\, lack of character development\\, etc. This film also\\, to its detriment\\, attempts to subvert audience expectations just because it can. \\n\\nYou can tell that the new sequel trilogy is being written on the fly with no overall plan for the story. After all how is it that Rian Johnson could be allowed to throw out almost everything that J.J. Abrams set up in the Force Awakens\\, and end his movie in a way that felt like the end of a trilogy instead of the middle movie?","true":true}
