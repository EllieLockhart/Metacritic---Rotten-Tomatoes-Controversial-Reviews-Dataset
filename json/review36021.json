{"101487":175789,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was an enjoyable film for the casual moviegoer -- or even a new\\, young Star Wars fan who doesn't understand the lore. What I can't understand is how the \\\"Critics Concensus\\\" here says that the film \\\"honors the saga's rich legacy.\\\" There was no honor shown to the past in this film. Luke is not Luke. He doesn't even get to swing his lightsaber. For the man who saved Darth Vader and never gave up on him even as he himself was being electrocuted to death\\, we are supposed to believe that Luke almost killed a sleeping child in a \\\"moment of weakness.\\\" The Force now has its own lore attached to it\\, and Yoda makes a surprise appearance in order to further explain this new understanding of The Force\\, \\\"Don't be so rigid\\\" he says to Luke. Well Yoda\\, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO TRAINED HIM!\\\" He then somehow projected himself believably into an epic-looking battle\\, doesn't swing his lightsaber\\, but also cheats death (since he was just a projection). However\\, he then randomly disappears\/dies soon thereafter. What? Why? Great twist when he wasn't really at the battle\\, but why ruin it by having him die right after that? Aside from this dishonorable portrayal of Luke\\, the Jedi\\, and The Force\\, this movie stole more than half of its cheesy humor from The Avengers. We could stand around and nitpick about Leia flying like Mary Poppins through space or BB8 commandeering an Imperial walker\\, or Snoke being extinguished so hastily\\, but those problems are obvious. Rey left her training early -- much to the dismay of her teacher (just like Luke did) -- and then the rebels defended themselves from Ape-T Ape-T's in an old base on a SNOW PLANET (oh but it was a salt planet. how do we know this? because a random dude touched it to his tongue and said\\, \\\"Salt.\\\")...I'm ready for an original plot that honors the original trilogy\\, but it's obvious that that is not going to happen. So now I'm trying not to be sad about the loss of an old friend (Star Wars) and appreciate the little bit of good I can find in the new films. I'll obviously continue to see new additions to the saga. Enjoy the completely new Star Wars\\, young kids. This is for you! :)","true":true}
