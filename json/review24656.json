Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"movie was a mishmash of different agendas and characters completely lacking any plot development. you dont care when any main bad guy such as snoke or phasma die because you have no sense of who they are or what their back stories were so there is no emotion. it feels like star wars is driving a message rather than a story.","true":true}
