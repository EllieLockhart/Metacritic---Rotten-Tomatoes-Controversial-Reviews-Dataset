Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a vitriolic addition to the Star Wars saga that continues the character assassination of the most beloved characters of the OT. With many gaps in logic\\, plot holes\\, inconsistencies between both this movie and TFA and within itself\\, a deconstruction of established mythos\\, and a complete lack is exposition\\, this movie exposes itself as a politically charged RJ and KK fan fiction to push their own agendas. And finally\\, as a fan of the Star Wars stories since I was 4 years old\\, this movie has made me completely disinterested in any future Star Wars media. It has disillusioned the last aspect of my childhood.","true":true}
