Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went in not expecting much but open minded and I was still disappointed by The Last Jedi. The acting was horrible. There was WAY too much forced\\, bad humor. They disrespected the Force\\, Luke Skywalker\\, and the entire franchise.","true":true}
