Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible movie! They destroyed the franchise\\, my childhood hero's and my dreams of seeing Luke finally live up to his lore. Why couldn't you have killed Luke and the Emperor with an epic planet shattering battle between them? This would have given us something to look forward to\\, i.e. the day Rey evolved to this power level. Try a little less SJW angle and a little more telling of the story. Star wars is inherently diverse\\, W\/T\/F is wrong with you people. I feel like I have been robbed. They could have done so many things with this story line\\, instead of \\\"kill the past\\, kill it all\\\". You could have rid yourself of the old characters\\, IN LINE WITH THE LORE! Screw you Disney\\, Screw you\\, all of your movies and these crappy political directors!","true":true}
