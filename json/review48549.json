Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Words cannot express how awful this film is. In 1977 I was 8 years old and sat happily to the first Star Wars and have seen each subsequent film in the theater.  I didn't care much for the three prequels however they had story arcs with emotional investment which carried the films from start to finish.  Star Wars The Last Jedi is just a mash of scenes with no story. It shows none of the charm or wit or character development of any of the other Star Wars films.  character motivation is absurd\\, acting is awful\\, action is overblown for actions sake. I come away from The Last Jedi thinking that Empire Strikes Back is as good as this franchise will ever get and I feel lucky that I was there in the theater in 1980 to Bear witness and feel awful that I sat through this pile of crap called The Last Jedi.","true":true}
