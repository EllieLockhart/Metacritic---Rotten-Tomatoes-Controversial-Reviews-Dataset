This is game is a far far cry from any of that. It's a masterfully crafted cinematic masterpiece that you can interact with and again pushes the boundaries of the medium of video games farther into art.\r\rHalf of the morons that leaves these surface level reviews are mad about the \\\"SJW agenda\\\" naughty dog is \\\"iNjEcTiNg iNtO My gAmEs\\\" The other half couldn't get over Joel's death.\r\rPeople bring up pacing a lot as their defense for hating this game while pacing a movie and pacing a game are entirely different things. They say that the game is a tired old revenge trope while all the endings and plot changes they suggest are literally the most cliched story tropes out there.\r\rMain thing I want to say is that this game needs to be PLAYED by a critically thinking ADULT. It's an experience that needs to effect you. Without our initial connection to Joel and Ellie\\, it would NOT be possible to simulate trauma and put the player into Ellie shoes. Without Abby (whose gameplay parts are some of the best in all naughty dog games) We see Naughty Dog continuing on a grander theme of how in a world of brutality and survival no one can ever be completely ethically right. Joel in the eyes of many is a monster.\rWe don't value people when we consider them the enemy\\, we dehumanize people so that we can point the finger at them when things go to sh!t. The haters of this game act in the same way\\, blindly hating without realizing what the other side is like. They are angry over fictional characters that are being used to tell the bigger story of the world around them.\r\rThis game is amazing so don't listen to these rubes if you actually want to truly FEEL and EXPERIENCE something never before done in a video game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
