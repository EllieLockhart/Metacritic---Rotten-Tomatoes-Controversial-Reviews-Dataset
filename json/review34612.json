Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The casting is terrible with the exception of Po\\, Rose and Benicio Del Toro\\, Dominic Gleeson is awful\\, as is Rey and Professor Snape's son Kylo Ren. Carrie and Mark have improved with age but you can see why they've not worked much in 30 plus years\\, the Purple haired woman and her female counterpart are wooden\\, the plot just takes the best ideas of the better films and visually rapes them\\, ruining the franchise more than the Phantom Menace and along with that my childhood awe at what Sci Fi can be. If you view it as a Tragic Comedy being gang banged by Disney with cheap gags and Pixar animated bollocks. Rian Johnson should be thrown in the Sarlaac Pit for this travesty. It proves once again that Wollywood has no originality and vision. The farce is strong with this one.","true":true}
