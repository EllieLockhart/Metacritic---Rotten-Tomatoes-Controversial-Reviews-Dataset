Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is BY FAR the worst Star Wars movie ever made. It DISHONORS the saga's rich legacy while adding absurd characters and story lines. This never felt like a Star Wars movie and was just a giant troll on the fan base. Yeah\\, it looked beautiful but the novice writing and horrendous attempts at humor just completely ruined this film. I will no longer be spending my money on any Star Wars movies Disney produces. Period. They don't and never respected the source material and it shows\\, so why would I support their abominations of my beloved saga. Done and done.","true":true}
