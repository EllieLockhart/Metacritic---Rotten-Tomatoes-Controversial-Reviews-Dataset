Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know what really to say. This movie is a confusing mess. it would take multiple views to really pin down what was wrong. Don't get me wrong. I was entertained for the length of the movie... but i also spent the whole time with something that was annoying me. The story telling is a mess. I'd also be remiss not to say that i did notice the forced diversity and it was at it's worst when leia and the other female commander broke were breaking the guys balls over taking a risk. Can there be any version of a strong female interacting with a male character without her talking down to him like a child? Then there's the Luke thing. That was probably the biggest mess. The casino town thing was also a clusterfuck of unnecessary. I GOT YOUR POLITICAL MESSAGE LOUD AND CLEAR. THE RICH ARE HORRIBLE. WHITE MEN ARE DOWN OR DEAD OR EVIL. AND MINORITIES AND FEMALES ARE THE ETERNAL HEROES. This movie's writters and directors and producers clearly hate everything that i am.. a straight white male.. so i'm pretty much done with this one. No more star wars for me.","true":true}
