Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie completely ruined all of Star Wars for me. the only good portion of this film was the character arc of Adam Driver's Kylo Ren. Rey continues to be a completely uninteresting character. the direction they decided to go with Luke Skywalker completely ruins all of the original movies and the impact of what he did in those films. the side characters are unneccasry with the way this movie was shot and the story unfolded. And lastly\\, most of what takes plac ein this move doesne make a lot of sense. \\\"Lets just wait until the resistance runs out of fuel...\\\" Horrible.","true":true}
