Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"wow totally ruined star wars. I will not be seeing the next movie as I now have no reason to. not only did you kill off the characters people actually cared about but you didn't make any attempts at making me care about the new ones. Also\\, kylo Ren is a terrible villain. why on Earth would you have him become the center of the plot??? the horrible awful plot. good just everything about this movie stunk. for reasons why please just read any other review on here. it doesn't need to be restated further. also bombs don't drop in space. and it shouldn't take an hour and a half to catch up to a ship your chasing. plot holes everywhere!","true":true}
