Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They destroyed Luke Skywalker. Luke is the most loving\\, kind and compassionate man in the galaxy. He refused to kill Vader\\, Vader!! And now we are supossed to believe he considered killing his teenager nephew?\\n\\nMeanwhile\\, Leia is superman and the forced can help you to survive in space.  The movie didn't take itself seriously\\, it was as if I was wacthing a Marvel movie. And I love Marvel\\, but Marvel is not Star Wars.\\n\\nFinally\\, what was the point of the movie? Say what you will about the prequels\\, but at least they told a story. Here I feel like the director came up with a few surprising cool ideas to entertain the audience\\, and then he forced the character to fit this ideas -- without any consideration for them.\\n\\nAnd lastly\\, I'm pkay with Rey being a \\\"noboday\\\"\\, that's actually pretty cool. But she should\\, at the very least\\, being one of Luke's students. She had to have received some sort of training.\\n\\nDoes anyone remember how clumpsy Luke was even after training with Yoda for weeks\/months? Even Anakin \\\"the chosen one\\\" got his ass handdled to him on AFTC. And this girl (and Leia too\\, by the way) are able to do things with the Force that not even the great master of the Jedi Order\\, who trained their whole lives\\, dreamed of doing...\\n\\nI'd say this movie kill Star Wars for me\\, but it didn't. I simple wont consider Disney cannon in the future. I will show my kids the originals and the prequels. Those are the movies made by George Lucas\\, and that's the real story of the Skywalkers.\\n\\nAnd yes\\, I love Rogue One. But StarWars cannon is Lucas\\, Disney is just making their own version of an EU.","true":true}
