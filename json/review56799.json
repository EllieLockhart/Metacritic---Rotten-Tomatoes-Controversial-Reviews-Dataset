Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The over all story was probably one of the better from star wars\\, however it felt like two different people wrote the script. The first wrote a well thought out and meaningful plot\\, the second looked over it and said \\\"Yeah yeah its good... but it needs more cheap gags and consumerism\\, oh and dont forget progressive pandering. Im not against most progressive things\\, but when u force it into an otherwise A-political movie\\, it really messes everything up\\, For so much of the movie\\, none of the characters seem to take their roles and story seriously\\, making dumb jokes in otherwise serious moments. Theres also alot of ridiculousness\\, like the Leah flying in space or the many ex machina events. And dont even get me started on those stupid fucking porgs. over all. had potential\\, but Disney fucked it over.","true":true}
