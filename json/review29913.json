Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"RT will not allow me to post as 1\/2 star review.  I see other users having this problem as well.  Disney paid off all your critics.  They paying for user review damage control too?  Business ethics at its finest here.  \\n\\n\\nVisual effects\\, and sound effects were stunning.  There are a couple of cool action sequences in the movie as well.  Otherwise\\, I'd like to forget that I saw such a poorly crafted movie.  I grew up watching star wars movies\\, playing with the toys\\, playing the video games\\, reading the literature\\, etc.  This movie did not do justice to any of the original characters or newly created characters from TFA.  \\n\\nRian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy have either never watched a star wars movie or were dedicated to destroying it.   Johnson and Kennedy failed to create any scenes without breaking them up with forced slapstick humor\\, there were plot holes that my 9-year-old pointed out\\, cringe-worthy moments like Leia Poppins\\, more unnecessary throw away characters than you can count\\, zero character development\\, and forced SJW side-quest to justify useless Rose. \\n\\nFurthermore\\, every man in this movie is either pathetic or incompetent.  Thanks Kathleen Kennedy!! Keep telling your predominantly male fan-base how much they suck!! Finn is a cowardly defector\\, Poe is a reckless \\\"flyboy\\,\\\" Luke is an incompetent jerk\\, DJ (Del Torro) is a backstabbing scumbag\\, and Hux and Kylo are just angry immature man-children.   \\n\\nSW is dead.  Disney wanted another Marvel-esque cash cow to milk.  They made money on this one and they could care less about the lack of creative and sensible writing.","true":true}
