Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is bold and takes risks\\, similar to the prequel trilogy. And like the prequel trilogy\\, the results are mixed\\, at best. As great as The Force Awakens was\\, it probably did The Last Jedi a disservice in that TFA felt too familiar and safe. The version of Luke Skywalker  that we see in this movie feels necessary\\, but ultimately unsatisfying. My problem with many of the twists and turns in this movie is not that TLJ sought to give the audience something different\\, but rather the twists felt underwhelming. The movie is saved by the compelling\\, complex relationship between Rey and Kylo Ren\\, the adorable Porgs\\, and an amazing\\, innovative use of Light Speed. In terms of taking a detour from familiar roads\\, here is hoping that the next film falls somewhere in between The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi.","true":true}
