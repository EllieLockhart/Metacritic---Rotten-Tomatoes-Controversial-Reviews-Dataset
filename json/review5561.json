Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Did Disney pay off the \\\"top critics\\\" or were they just all women? I'm sad to see my childhood dream raped and pillaged by Disney. I knew the Politically correct company would find ways to appeal to all audiences instead of evolving a great legacy helmed by George Lucas. Don't get me started on the Luke skywalker  character.....! Funny how all the good people were woman and all the bad guys were Men!","true":true}
