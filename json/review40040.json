Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is my first ever Rotten Tomatoes movie review. I am such a die hard Star Wars fan\\, that I felt that this movie warranted my first ever review. I honestly don't know what to say other than this is probably the worst Star Wars movie since Episode I. Here's why:\\n1. No one said \\\"I've got a bad feeling about this\\\".\\n2. Luke Skywalker was a coward.\\n3. The whole Finn and Rose storyline was pointless.\\n4. Rose = The New Jar Jar.\\n5. Leia is space superman.\\n6. SNOKE! They killed off Snoke without ever divulging into his background!?!\\n7. PHASMA! They killed off Phasma without ever divulging into her background?!?\\n8. Rey's parents are truly nobodies? Really? I hope this is not true.\\n9. Too much humor. And some of the humor was just.... awkward.\\n\\nFinally\\, a good story must take precedence over how diverse the cast is. Yay\\, there are more female cast members\\, but there are so many damn plot holes! Yay\\, another plus for diversity with Rose\\, but damn was her character direction horrible! PC culture ruins creativity. UGHHH!\\n\\nI agree with Mark Hamill that Rian Johnson's writing of Luke Skywalker's character was fundamentally wrong. \\n\\nYou have failed us Rian Johnson. You have failed us.","true":true}
