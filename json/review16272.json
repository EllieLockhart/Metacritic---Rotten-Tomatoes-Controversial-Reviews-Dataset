Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not going to go into a full depth review of this movie\\, but simply put\\, this move would probably be more favorable without all the forced humor (even when it's not needed). The story is alright...definitely could have been worthwhile with a little more thought behind it. It was just too bogged down. Remember all those questions that haunted you after episode 7? The strong desire to know more about all the mysterious characters that had you excited for all the possibilities that could arise in episode 8? Well\\, don't you worry about those questions\\, because they apparently don't matter. This movie truly did leave me disconnected from the franchise\\, which is something no other star wars movie has done. The only thing semi-worth thinking about for the next movie is this new love triangle thing that's going on. To be blunt\\, unfortunately not even John Williams can fix this movie.","true":true}
