Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie wasn't bad\\, let me just say that. It just wasn't all that good overall. The simplest way to say how I felt in general about The Last Jedi was that it felt like I was binge watching 5-6 episodes of a show where most of the episodes were good but one or two were just bad and took you out of it. The last jedi has memorable moments and some solid characters but is dragged down by its lengthy run-time\\, cringe-worthy plot structure and choices\\, and by some prequel-like corny animals in a dumb plot-point with ultimately no stakes or results. Fun at times but disappointing overall is all I can say about The Last Jedi","true":true}
