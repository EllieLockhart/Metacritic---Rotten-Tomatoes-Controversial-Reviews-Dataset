Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Held together by a memorable comeback performance from Mark Hamill\\, The Last Jedi is not a bad film\\, but it fails to live up to the Star Wars legacy. Jedi is let down by unfocused direction\\, poor pacIng\\, and most of all\\, a bloated script. As a result\\, it does not belong in the pantheon of great cinema that the original trilogy occupies. In fact\\, it never comes close. There are far too many uninteresting characters and far too many unnecessary subplots that drag the film down. The crew at Disney seems to be unable to capture the magic of George Lucas\u2019 original Star Wars. There are too many cooks on the grill. And the result is an overdone mess. The casting choices are peculiar\\, so the film suffers from at least three poor performances: from the totally out of place Kellie Marie Tran\\, to the flat Laura Dern\\, and another clumsy performance from John Boyega. It\u2019s a shame since some of the cast truly shines: Daisy Ridley\\, Oscar Isaac\\, and Adam Driver take command of the screen. It\u2019s just a shame that their strong performances are diluted by the annoyingly inadequate side characters. The old guard\\, now reduced to Luke\\, Leia\\, and Chewbacca (yes R2 and 3PO too)\\, really hold the crumbling plot together\\, grounding it to the roots of the Star Wars franchise. Without them\\, the film would be hopelessly lost. Mark Hamill\u2019s revival of a three-decade old character was impressive. I only wish his character was given the spotlight he deserved. The Last Jedi is a frustratingly middling film. The visuals are spectacular\\, and it features glimmers of greatness. I will hold on to those moments\\, cherish them\\, but the rest\\, well\\, should have been left on the cutting room floor.","true":true}
