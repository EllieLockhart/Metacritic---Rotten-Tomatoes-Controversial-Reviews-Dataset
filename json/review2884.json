Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful. Through this movie and his interviews\\, it's clear Rian Johnson's only aim was to try and create something unexpected. Which he succeeds in doing\\, at the expense of the star wars universe. Cheap laughs and cheaper story. Visually breathtaking\\, however.","true":true}
