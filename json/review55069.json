Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've seen this movie 2 times. They got my money...unfortunately I got both  tickets in advance. Anyway...I'll start with +: visually the movie looks fantastic\\, but that's it.\\nNow -: Movie it's a mess. They try to continue a stories in a star wars universe\\, but what they achieve is to deform\\, mutate the feel of Star wars\\, creating characters like Ray\\, who is a Mary Sue\\, who achieve powers(use of so called force) in like 1 week from when the Force awakens starts\\, powers who others needs decades to master. \\nThe way Leia is portrait here it's a joke\\, she literally floats in space like a Marry Poppins and some of her actions make no sense\\, like after she recover from coma she stuns Poe without knowing what it's really happens\\nKill Ren it is the definition of EMO. \\n...omg..I just got mad...I cannot write anymore.... anyway..Disney killed this franchise\\, and the number one culprit is that feminist broad Kennedy \\, who order the death of Luke Skywalker\\, after she felt overpowered at conventions and didn't like Mark Hamil attitude....just look what's happening in SW universe...it's like the women are the one who knows how to take decisions and all males are stupid...\\nCorny dialog\\, humor out of place\\, huuuuge plot holes\\, deformation of characters.\\nReally\\,... who ever is in charge of the Star Wars saga\\, should be fired right now\\, before is to late\\nGeorge Lucas created a world\\, even with the prequels\\, who are waaaaaaaaay more better the this disaster movie \\\"the last jedi\\\".Those new so called writers they just mutated the universe\\,....so pathetic. \\nStar Wars for me it has just 6 episodes. Whatever is after Return of the Jedi it's not Star Wars...it's mikey mouse in space leaded by a stupid old broad...\\nRIP STAR WARS","true":true}
