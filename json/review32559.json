Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: the Last Jedi has hit a new record with this episode quite possibly being the worst thing to happen to the franchise since the Star Wars Christmas Special aired in the 70s. The first half of the movie is filled with shallow one liners\\, telephone pranks\\, and stupid looks from \\\"funny\\\" looking animals in a desperate and unsuccessful attempt to get cheap laughs. To say this is an attempt at a Space Balls sequel would be an insult to Space Balls. I would rather watch a full length movie with Jar Jar Binks as the protagonist than see The Last Jedi again. That being said\\, there are numerous questions and plot points brought up by The Force Awakens which TLJ quickly cuts off with no chance of answering\\, Yoda gained way too much weight in the afterlife and apparently took some english lessons. The plot is paper thin and drags on slower than the rebels trying to escape the star destroyers. If you are between the ages of 3 and 10 you might enjoy this simple and cheap commedy which I call the ashes of the once amazing Star Wars franchise.","true":true}
