Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was a very bold Star Wars movie and many risks were taken. I believe more of the plot worked than did not and worked out to be a very good movie. The Last Jedi set up episode 9 for something that could be both great and something that Star Wars fans have never seen before in Star Wars movies. Reys parentage reveal was something people could relate too as it sent the message that you don't have to be a part of a blood line to be something great. Luke having problems I didn't mind since he came back in the most bad ass way. The Snoke decision is something we have never seen before and set up the next film for something new. Ultimately\\, the Last Jedi is a fantastic entry to continue on to episode 9. Best of the sequel movies and would make my top 3 Star Wars movies.","true":true}
