Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movies was incoherent and none of the characters have the potential to be memorable.  The main plot was weak and this movie is an anomaly on this site.  Did the critics get to see a totally different movie?","true":true}
