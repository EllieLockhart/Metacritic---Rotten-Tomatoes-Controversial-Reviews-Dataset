Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers: Snoke does with no backstory to his name and Rey who we thought was of special lineage had none. The buildup was completely ruined. The worst part was killing off Luke by making him die from not even fighting anyone. He should have died a hero yet he died cowardly. Don't even get me started on Superman Leia. Overall\\, the Last Jedi is one of the worst sequels I have ever seen. I have more respect for the Phantom Menace because that at least had one lightsaber fight and had some respect for the franchise.","true":true}
