Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not good at all. The whole story is just off. How did the rebel fleet become so weak in the first place? How did Ray become such a 'powerful Jedi' with no real training or advice? Story makes no sense what so ever. Can never beat the original movies. The producers who made the storyline clearly did not do a good job. They tried to make the movie different but ended up making a mockery of the franchise.","true":true}
