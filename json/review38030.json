Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Star Wars saga offers a whole universe of potential\\, but what do we get? A half-assed Marvel movie wanna-be. Cracking jokes every 5 minutes and overusing plot twists isn't a good move. We could've had  great character development for Rey\\, Kylo and Snoke\\, we instead get Rose Tico and Holdo (SJW\\, leftist ideology spreaders and boring characters)\\, no backstory whatsoever to Snoke\\, Porgs and a disgrace to the Star Wars saga. All in all a \\\"meh\\\" movie ruined by a newbie (Rian J.) and\\, of course\\, Darth Kennedy. Episode 9 is going to suffer greatly from the disappointment and backlash caused by this movie\\, just like Solo: A Star Wars Story is right now.","true":true}
