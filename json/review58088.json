Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Parts:\\nLight saber toss\\,\\nRunning out of fuel\\,\\nDrinking blue milk\\,\\nLeia Mary Poppins\\,\\nYoda is not comedic relief\\,\\nSave the wildlife\\,\\nUsing hyperspace as a weapon\\, changes everything\\nNo answer( who is who?)\\,\\nSnoke was useless\\,\\nRose is annoying \\,\\nNo lightsaber duel?\\,\\nThe entire plot is the resistance or rebellion running out of fuel\\, and for some unknown reason the first order can't hyperspace abit in front to flank them? Or do anything actually tactical.\\n\\nI have to stop before the list is too long\\, I could go on forever\\n\\n","true":true}
