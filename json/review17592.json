{"101487":139898,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-21","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I so wanted to like this movie\\, but in the end it was so excruciatingly bad\\, that it had me rethinking what the worst Star Wars movie was.  Stupidly I fought my better instincts to get up and leave after the first 15 minutes\\, but I knew I couldn't get a refund on my ticket at that point.  From the opening scene of Poe \\\"tooling\\\" with Hux in an unfunny attempt at humor\\, to the inability of three star destroyers and a dreadnaught to have more than 10 tie fighters between them was ridiculous.  Regardless\\, a dreaded war machine can't seem to recharge it's powerful guns in what seemed to be an eternity to fire on the rebel base.  Then I had to question my whole sense of time\\, as after an opening scene that seemed to establish some amount of time elapsing between TFA and TLJ\\, we then rejoin Rae and Luke\\, back where we left them staring dumbfounded at eachother as she hands him his lightsaber.  Whereas Obi Wan could sense events like the destruction of Alderan\\, Luke is completely clueless that his best friend Han was killed\\, that upteen planets were destroyed by starkiller base\\, etc.  He just sits there moping for a majority of the movie.  We have glimpses of a story when Kylo Ren struggles to destory the ship his mother is on\\, only to have his accompanying Tie fighters destroy the bridge.  What one would have thought would be a fitting tribute to Leia  (Carrie Fisher)\\, instead she flies like Mary Poppins in space back to the ship.  Can someone please explain this?  We have a lot of wasted time at the casino\\, a buzzkill of a fight between Phasma and Fin\\, Rae somehow being the \\\"Chosen One\\\" without any setup in the story\\, Poe acting like a dick for most of the movie until he decides to give Rae a \\\"How you doin?\\\"\\, and Luke going out like Michael Corleone at the end of Godfather III.  And maybe the worst is the \\\"standoff\\\" between the first order and the rebel ships.  Seriously\\, Tie Fighters cant fly that far from the cruisers?  Didn't Darth Vader fly quite far after the original death star was destroyed.  Presumably they would have similar range as X-wings\\, which we have already seen fly lightspeed and Luke flew one all the way to Dagoba.  And despite Vader's cruiser being able to out fly Leia's ship in Episode IV\\, they just sit there for 6 hours waiting for the rebel ships to run out of fuel? The \\\"rules\\\" of the SW universe have already been established thru 7 prior films\\, and TLJ just seems to insult your intelligence at every turn.  If you have no concept of the Star Wars canon and universe\\, you may find this movie entertaining\\, but I hate myself for not waiting for a rental on redbox.  This is one movie I will never watch again\\, and JJ Abrams has a big mountain to climb to recover from this trainwreck in Episode IX.","true":true}
