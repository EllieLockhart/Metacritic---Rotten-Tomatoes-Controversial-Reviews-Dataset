Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are so many things that bother me about this movie\\, to me this is by far the worst Star Wars movie i have ever seen. Most of the franchise was rebooted for this? Seriously i have given all of the new movies a fair chance and tried my best with this one. So many pointless scenes\\,plot elements that were wasted that were built up since episode 7\\, what was the point of building this connection  with Rey and Anakins Lightsaber\\,where are the Knights of Ren\\,what was the point of building up the suspense for 2 years of who Rey's parents are? I mean sure they can always claim that what Kylo told her was true but from a certain view but still feels like a cop out either way. Rose was by far the character i hated the most\\, she felt forced and i couldn't stand any scene she was in\\,many points of the movie felt pointless with terrible plot holes. The Mary flipping poppins scene was crap\\,the purpled hair general could of avoided so many problems had she just told her freaking subordinates what her plan was! Rey's training was flat out non existent and i  honestly stopped caring about her mid way. The way Luke's character was handled is what completely killed the movie for me and i will not bother to support them for the next installments.","true":true}
