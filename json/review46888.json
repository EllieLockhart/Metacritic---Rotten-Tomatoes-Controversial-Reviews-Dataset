Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Welp\\, it sucked.  Weak character development\\, cheesy scenes and lines\\, misplaced humor and PC propaganda galore.\\n\\nIf I wanted to get a dose of poitics\\, I'd tune into NPR.  All you had to do was give Luke and Leia a proper sendoff and develop the cast from TFA.  Instead we got the new ploy to spend money on Disney merchandise\\, AKA Porgs and very forgettable new people.......as in I don't know their names - just purple-haired admiral and token minority who could give Jar Jar Binks a run for most annoying in the galaxy.  They did Luke a dirty with his role in this movie.  He deserved better.","true":true}
