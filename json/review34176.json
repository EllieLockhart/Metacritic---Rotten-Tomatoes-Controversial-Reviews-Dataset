Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thank you Disney for destroying all of the hard work the true Star Wars franchise built. Every story plot is recycled from the original trilogy yet again . Just like its\u2019 predecessor The Force Awakens \\, and for making a mockery of Skywalker Legacy! ","true":true}
