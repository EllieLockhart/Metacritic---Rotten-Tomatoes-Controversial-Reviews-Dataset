Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This could have been so much better. Less humor\\, less cgi\\, building or characters more instead of killing them off.... This felt like the prequels again. I just hope JJ can do a better job with IX","true":true}
