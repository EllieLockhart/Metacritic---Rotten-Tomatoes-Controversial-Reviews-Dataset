Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Instead of taking risks with the new cast and developing the new characters\\, this movie still focuses on \\\"risks\\\" with the old (irrelevant) trio instead. As opposed to VII this movie takes the franchise in new directions and further expands the universe\\, albeit into unfamiliar weird directions a lot. But at least it's something to respect\\, which combined with a good pacing made this movie exciting. The awful storytelling and bad \\\"not Starwarsy\\\" lore is what ultimately keeps this movie under 3 stars. Also stop trying to desperately be funny. We don't need a punchline in EVERY scene.","true":true}
