Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Did the director in this film even watch TFA. Why create a map to find Luke SKYWALKER if he never wanted to be found. If he just wanted to hide and die. Wasnt finding the map to SKYWALKER the entire plot of TFA?? This film suffers miserably at hitting any sort of mark. The storyline is awful\\, the writing is terrible.In fact\\, the whole story falls flat on its face often with scenes that simply make no sense. The story-line surrounding Luke is terrible\\, In fact\\, I don't think anything would have changed in the story if he had never reappeared. That's how insignificant the writers made him in this film. Thanks very much to the write and director of this movie who destroyed what might have been the most anticipated Star Wars movie yet. I fact you might have destroyed the legend of Luke SKYWALKER for eberyone of the previous films as well. Brutal.","true":true}
