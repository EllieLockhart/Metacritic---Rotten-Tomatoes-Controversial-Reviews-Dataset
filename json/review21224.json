Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I watched this in theatres when it came out. Just recently tried watching it again on Netflix. It's horrible. Anybody who supports this film is obviously a SJW supporting the obviously political bias throughout the movie or paid off like the critics were here on Rotten Tomatoes. That being said\\, I don't mind politics as much as I do bad writing. Reverse character development\\, massive plot holes\\, Mary Sues\\, and the wrong character dying; it's unbelievably terrible. This movie isn't a movie. And I will never consider it as such. It's a slap in the face to true Star Wars fans.","true":true}
