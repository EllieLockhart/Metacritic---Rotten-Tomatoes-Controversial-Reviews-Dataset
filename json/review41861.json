Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is terrible\\, they have killed off every major actor from the best trilogie 4.5 and 6 and there is no character progression for Rey\\, a person who can do everything without training and defeating kyloren\\, someone who has been training his whole life. also they kill off snoke\\, now the most useless and forgetible bad guy. what is left is a political\\, feminist\\, SJW Bullshit.\\nSo Kathleen Kennedy thanks for destroying this franshise","true":true}
