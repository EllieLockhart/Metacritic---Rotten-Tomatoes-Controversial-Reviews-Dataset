Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They made Luke such a weak character for being supposedly the most powerful Jedi ever he was sad\\, running away and plain scared of Kylo\/Rey? And who were Rey\u2019s parents again because that was a sad explanation of something they purposely built up! Poe sucked! Fin\u2019s story line was just sad\\, tucked in there but served no purpose! I\u2019m waiting for dvd for the next movie and will not be adding to Disney pockets trying to gouge movie goers\/ Star Wars fans and then deliver a crappy movie but the special effects worked!
