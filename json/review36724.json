Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie itself was visually appealing and I would rate it high\\, but then you factor in the completely useless Canto\\, the unrealistic Leia Poppins when she and everyone else would have went through massive decompression *almost instant death seriously*\\, and the way Luke was treated and not redeem himself in front of Rey's eyes\\, the image of Luke and not his lightsaber not queuing Kylo into the truth\\, the way the movie did not advance the story and instead killed off several plottable hooks (rey's parents\\, Snoke dead\\, no master of Kylo so no redemption arc\\, the knights of ren cannot possibly have the power to command that entire empire\\, and destroyed iconic lightsaber). Essentially Rian did all this and then drops the mic and says \\\"Ha!\\\" Try to do something with this now J.J Abrams.\\n\\nIt felt disrespectful to the franchise and to the next director. Seriously\\, JJ has to create alot from nothing and then end the saga\\, which means new characters created just for the end.... stupid move!","true":true}
