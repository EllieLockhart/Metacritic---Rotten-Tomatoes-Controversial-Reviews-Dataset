Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never saw so many WTF? moments in a movie. Everyone is doing something\\, that doesn't make any sense. So many plot holes and stupid decisions. Humor is terrible most of the time.","true":true}
