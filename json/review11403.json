Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible\\, horrible movie. Worst SW movie EVER. New characters are boring and have not been built up enough to invest any feelings into them. Worst part of all\\, was the total slap in the face of Luke Skywalker. Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy really took a piss on this beloved franchise. Would have given a zero star score but anything under a 1 doesn't count.","true":true}
