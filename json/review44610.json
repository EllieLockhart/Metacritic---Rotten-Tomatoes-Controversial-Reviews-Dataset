Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Totally destroyed my enjoyment in star wars. Corrupted Luke's character\\, reinvented the force badly and unnecessarily. I'm waiting now for a remake.\\nP.S. social commentary has no place in the greatest story ever told in modern times. Way to go to destroy a good story Disney!","true":true}
