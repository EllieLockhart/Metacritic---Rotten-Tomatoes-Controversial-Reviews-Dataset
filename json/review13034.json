Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":" I don\u2019t get why fans are bombing on this. I thought it was really good\\, if not great. Not sure if it\u2019s better than Ep5 but it\u2019s one of the best for sure.","true":true}
