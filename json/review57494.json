Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This proves that critics have no idea what they are talking about. Listen to the audience score because it is right. Juvenile jokes. I mean really. There is a yo mamma joke in the opening scene. Go see this if you are 5 years old. Go see this if you wish to see the legendary Luke Skywalker character get epically trashed. Go see this if you wish to see social justice gender \/ race baiting crap in your movie. Go see this if you wish to never care to hear a fan theory again because in the end the director will just do whatever he wants and throw a big middle finger at you. Go see this if you wish to see a villain so powerful with the force it almost limitless and then watch him die in the stupidest way possible that only kids would believe. Don't believe me? Even Mark Hamill himself is outspoken about not liking this movie and that should tell you something.","true":true}
