Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is at all places but in the same tine its not in one. He is everywhere but its not where it should be. Action for the sake of action\\, time flow is out of order. Scrip is bad\\, and its like this: When ever writers find them self in dead end whit story\\, instead to return few page and rewrite all\\, they go for god intervention and last second rescuer scenes. Comedy parts are meh\\, Its like I was watching Guardians of The Galaxy.   \\nSome characters are force into movie. This is not Star Wars movie its Hero movie in space\\, but whiteout of heroes.","true":true}
