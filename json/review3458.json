Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Best saber fight since Anakin v Obi-Wan in part 3. Plus a Luke dichotomy that feels like it's been splitting him in half for years. No\\, Ray is not the protagonist in the film and because of this\\, the film is actually able to explore its other characters that were completely flat and annoyingly whiny in the first one.","true":true}
