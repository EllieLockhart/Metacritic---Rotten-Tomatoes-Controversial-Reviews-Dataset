Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While being a Star Wars film in its current era it is expected to be a great film. Unfortunately\\, it\u2019s not the case here. After seeing TFA 2 years ago\\, I left being blown away and wanting more. With TLJ\\, I kind of was wondering most of the time where the story is headed. Don\u2019t get me wrong\\, there were some AWESOME scenes\\, but were then offset with events where I was left scratching my head at. Judge for yourself but personally I thought it was disappointing.","true":true}
