Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was really disappointed when I saw The Last Jedi. Hoped it would redeem The Force Awakens\\, but that hope didn't materialize. Saw \\n\\nAvengers Endgame today\\, was totally blown away\\, entertained\\, and wished the same inspiration could have come upon the Star Wars \\n\\nmovies. Maybe wishful thinking since there's only one more part to the saga; miracles can't happen.","true":true}
