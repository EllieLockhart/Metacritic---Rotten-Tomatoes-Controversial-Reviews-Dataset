Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Total letdown...I saw the movie twice\\, I really wanted to like it\\, I really did. I didnt read any reviews ahead of time\\, I avoided any spoiler materials\\, I wanted to be surprised\\, and boy was I ever.\\n\\n I've always been a lurker\\, reading other reviews but never rated or contributed a review. I created my account just to express my disappointment. \\n\\nTFA set up big questions:\\n- Who is Rey? Who are her parents? What is her connection to the bigger picture?\\n- Who is Snoke? Where did he come from? How did he rebuild the Empire after such a crushing defeat? Is he a Sith? Where did the scars come from? How does he know Luke?\\n\\nThere was a lot of buildup\\, lots of anticipation. Even Kathleen Kennedy got in on the speculation saying twins run in the Skywalker family. Then\\, after two years\\, it was like running into a wall. Nothing\\, Rey is a nobody. Snoke\\, well just as he is starting to get interesting\\, lets just kill him. No answers.\\n\\nThe forced humor in the script just didn't work. Leia flying through space was ridiculous. Purple haired Admiral\\, she was a waste of a character. Rose is an unneeded character and a distraction. Felt like she she was forced into the script to increase diversity and to get Finn away from Rey\\, to introduce a new love interest because they decided Rey and Finn weren't going to be a thing. If Finn and Rose were not in the movie\\, nothing different would have happened. They were a big distraction\\, waste of screen time. I love long movies\\, I'd sit through a good 4 hour movie\\, but this movie was too long for no reason.\\n\\nThe beginning of the movie felt like it was just one set-up after another\\, Very disjointed. Every time a character mentioned another character that wasn't in the current scene\\, they jumped to that character and a new scene. Very jarring. There was no pacing. It certainly didn't feel like this movie picked up immediately after TFA.\\n\\nThe slow speed spaceship chase was absolutely stupid. The ships couldn't light speed for an instant to get in front of the resistance and turn around? They have to just slowly pace the resistance ships? They cant call to other First Order ships and tell them where to meet to get in front of the stupid ship? No tension. It was a forced plot scheme to put Poe in a box and make him \\\"grow\\\" into a leader.\\n\\nBut the biggest issue is Luke. Over the original three movies\\, he grows up\\, becomes the hero taking a path that Yoda and Obi Wan never saw. Only Luke could turn Vader\\, save his father and stop the Empire. So\\, its been 40 years\\, we cannot wait to see the wisest\\, most powerful Jedi ever and we get a winy\\, old man version of Hayden Christianson's Anakin. Then he's killed off without even a fight. He died because he force projected himself? We never got to see the hero he grew into.\\n\\nI tried watching ANH last night just to see good Luke. All I see now is the stubborn winy loser that refused to leave the island and died there. Thanks for ruining Star Wars Rian Johnson.","true":true}
