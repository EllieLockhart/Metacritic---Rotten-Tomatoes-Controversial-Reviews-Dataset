Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What an \\\"udder\\\" disaster.  Not a Star Wars movie.  Rian Johnson decided to give a giant middle finger to anyone who had an emotional investment in the saga.  Worst Star Wars movie to date.  Ewok Adventure and Battle for Endor much better than this garbage.\\n\\nExtremely disappointed that someone decided to approve this script and release this movie.\\n\\nThis guy has a great petition going to strike this abomination from the canon and remake it.\\n\\nhttps:\/\/www.change.org\/p\/the-walt-disney-company-have-disney-strike-star-wars-episode-viii-from-the-official-canon\\n\\n**edit**\\nReally pathetic that Disney has all these bots giving this thing good reviews.  The real audience score is most likely in the 20s.  Shame on you Disney.","true":true}
