Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really disappointed about this sequel trilogy. The ambition of creating new chapter is good but the story teller is bad. Full of meaningless plot just for Disney to sell their new toys. When I saw resistance bomber I wondered if designer know that there is no gravity on that space ship.","true":true}
