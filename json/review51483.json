Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A complete betrayal of established characters \\,plot and history of star wars.basically threw away everything that matters for a message that is not required for a star wars movie no one goes to the movies to deal with real life they do it to escape.","true":true}
