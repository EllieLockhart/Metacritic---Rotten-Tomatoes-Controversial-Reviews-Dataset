Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely loved this film. I don't care what everyone else has to say about its flaws (it's by no means perfect) the good far outweighs the bad. The plot is solid\\, the cinematography is spectacular and quite frankly this is one of the best Star Wars films ever released. Yes\\, there is some filler\\, yes\\, some of the characters are slightly wasted and yes I can take or leave porgs but this was a thoroughly spectacular film and I left the cinema feeling entertained and thirsty for episode IX.","true":true}
