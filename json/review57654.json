Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Total garbage! Even though TFA was just a bad remake of the original movies it did contain new characters which I thought would have some meaning and point in TLJ\\, but they really didn't. So\\, bottom line is TLJ is not only the nail in the coffin for the original SW by completely rewriting characters to fit a narrative \\, but also destroys the possibility of propping up TFA making it a more meaningful addition to the over all story\\, which in turn  makes Ep.9 already bad! BTW\\, I didn't pay to see this awful movie(had an invite by a friend with free tickets)\\, after the needless remake that was TFA\\, I would never give Disney a penny for a bad SW film. Don't reward them for trash movies\\, wait for netflix or the like.","true":true}
