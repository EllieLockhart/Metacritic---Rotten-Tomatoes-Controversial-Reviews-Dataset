Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is gutsy\\, but overall I liked it. There were things I really enjoyed and things I wasn't crazy about\\, but it was a pretty solid sequel even though I feel like it didn't have the emotional impact that TFA or Rogue One did.","true":true}
