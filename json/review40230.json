Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not the movie you are looking for.  Rian Johnson tried to do something different\\, but in doing so\\, completely missed the mark (as well as J.J. Abrams\\, but not as severely) on what a final trilogy in the story of the Skywalker saga is supposed to be. The first trilogy was a poor\\, muddled attempt to explain the rise of the Empire and the rise of Darth Vader. The original trilogy was the story of his son\\, overcoming the darkness and the Empire. (Great fodder of source material) But to hold true to the entire arc\\, the first trilogy raised the idea of balance to the force. Between the first trilogy and original trilogy\\, nearly all Jedi are dead as well as Sith. That's balance\\, right? So while Force Awakens eludes to an explosion of force users in the galaxy\\, that was not the story. Now\\, in Last Jedi\\, we don't have a Skywalker to continue. We have Kylo\\, daughter of Leia\\, but Force Awakens isn't from his pov. He isn't the protagonist or even an anti hero. Instead\\, let's forget that this is supposed to be a connected saga and tell a completely different story. That is the single issue here and why so many fans felt like they got the middle finger. Throw in the additional wonky element of... There's still a Rebel Alliance...and inside that is another Resistance...which doesn't make sense on the level of simplistic archetypes from which the original trilogy pulled from Joseph Campbell's archives. That's another detailing of the first trilogy as well. And there isn't an empire\\, but they have alli the old toys that they've updated slightly. ...As far as original material\\, Force Awakens is a half hearted attempt. This leads to Last Jedi where Rian basically didn't want to be connected to anything\\, and the obvious reason was that he didn't understand the material well enough. Add to that some crazy decisions to show Leah's awakening of the force in a ridiculous Mary Poppins magical moment....it's called foreshadowing...the audience needed to see her force push something or have greater force sensing abilities than where we left off in the original trilogy instead of BAM\\, she's now magic. \\\"That's not how the force works\\\". The other major drawback to this film is that it is too self aware. People talk to Leah as if she's this great matriarch that they've All been on adventures with. No one had any other opinion of her from within the story other than nostalgic grandeur. .....If we had started this journey with the first trilogy\\, instead of the original\\, and it had taken 40 years in between\\, then Sir Alec Guinness would have revenge this kind of treatment which makes no sense in the confines of the actual story. That is the biggest middle finger in all of this is that it winks and nods to the fans with a sledgehammer and then in the next breath tells exertions to go f themselves because the finale to a saga is not what you're going to get. Who cares if you've been told that's what you're going to get and that you've set a lifetime of expectation for... As far as a standalone movie with no history behind it...it's still very ridiculous and offers no coherent understanding of why people have magic space powers or why the main bad guys are ridiculous parodies of anyone worth inciting fear abroad the galaxy or engendering respect to a single cause. In short\\, bad acting\\, bad story and disconnected from itself.","true":true}
