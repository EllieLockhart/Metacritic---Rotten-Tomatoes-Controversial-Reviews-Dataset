Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Social Justice Wars\\n\\nIn a nutshell - all white men are evil (must be their white privilege). If they are non-white men\\, they're not evil but they are definitely stupid and women need to tell them what to do. Also\\, animal rights matter and eating meat is bad - take note Chewbacca. What a terrible movie. It's like someone had an extra hot curry\\, took some laxatives and shat all over the original trilogy.","true":true}
