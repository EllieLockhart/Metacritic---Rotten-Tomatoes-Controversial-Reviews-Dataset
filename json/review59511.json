The gameplay is great. It\u2019s one of the last PS4 games due to the coming of the PS5 by the end of the year. I understand people being upset with this game. I myself got really upset at some points but definitely it doesn\u2019t deserve a 0\\, 1\\, 2 as a score nor a 10 or a 9. This game sold fans that we were having a new adventure with the duo we all love Ellie & Joel. A lot of us played the first game long time ago therefore it was exciting to think of it. But somehow and that is totally comprehensive the writers decided to go other way. Joel the protagonist of the first game gets killed in a gruesome way at a few hours of just start playing. Later the attitude of Ellie is rude with the people that care about her. I loved this character Dina she was great but the attitude of Ellie wasn\u2019t the best towards her. So later after some hours of play through the game switches to Abby... this character which is responsable of the death of Joel. I felt that this was done with the intention of emphasizing with Abby but she just killed a character we all loved. At this time we don\u2019t care what could she have done. But the game makes you play as her for a long time. This could have been a great adventure killing Joel was unnecessary if you ask me but if the writers wanna do it that way it\u2019s fine I just think that the could have take it totally different maybe the story of Ellie and Dina that happens due to other circumstances...The story is really dramatic and depressing to be honest. Ellie loses everything at the end and Abby doesn\u2019t lose anything. Ellie loses two of her fingers\\, Jessie\\, Tommy\\, Dina & Joel... and man when the credits rolled I felt really\\, really sad. I didn\u2019t want an end like that... I rate this game a 7 because it has good gameplay and at the end I guess It fulfilled its purpose which was make me sad... I cried. Those flashbacks with Joel just broke my heart. So I guess that was an intention. But making us play as Abby... I felt it offensive and unnecessary\u2026 Expand","true":true}
