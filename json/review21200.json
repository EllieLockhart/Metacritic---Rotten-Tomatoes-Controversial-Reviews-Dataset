Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I watched it Thursday and genuinely thought about it since then.\\nMy conclusion is that I do not like the movie. It just does not feel like Star Wars anymore. Just any bad scyfi movie with lightsabers. I really hope they can fix this somehow but i think they just killed the star wars fanboy inside me.","true":true}
