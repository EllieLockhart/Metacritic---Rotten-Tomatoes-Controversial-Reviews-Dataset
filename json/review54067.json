Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I did not like this film. Its hard to state why however\\, it is a well acted film\\, the production values top notch\\, and the Direction\\, while average\\, does not detract from the film. \\n\\nThe two reasons that I could come up with is the Script\\, and its themes. The script is a mess. There are too many characters stealing time from each other. There was no reason for Leia's character to go to sleep and be replaced by Holdo\\, as it did not advance the story or its characters conflicts in any way. This sort of thing happens throughout the whole film. \\n\\nAlso\\, at its heart\\, this film comes across as deeply cynical. While Empire Strikes back is dark and mature\\, it does not undercut the heroism and optimism of the original Star Wars. The Last Jedi (and its predecessor) comes across as a film made by someone with intellectual pretensions who was embarrassed to be working on a film as simplistic as \\\"Star Wars\\\" movie\\, and set out to deconstruct \\\"the myth of the hero.\\\"","true":true}
