Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After the first viewing\\, there are a few great elements that can't go unnoticed. Luke's arc and presence were at an all time best with a wonderful performance given by Mark. I respected the path chosen with some of the plot twists\\, to ensure this trilogy stands out as it's own. That being said\\, the humor seemed extremely campy with some clanky dialogue in pretty intense moments. Captain Phasma was yet again a huge letdown at what seemed to be this trilogy's best attempt to give us a Boba Fett like character. Finn's \\\"codebreaker\\\" scenes were weak and constantly threw me out of the loop of a pretty well paced movie. I couldn't help but almost laugh and cringe at Leia's force abilities in this movie\\, as it came off so unnaturally. I remember seeing TFA 3 times for how excited and engaged it made me feel. I had every expectation this would be the superior film\\, but in almost every way it wasn't.","true":true}
