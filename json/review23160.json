Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it! Everyone seems to want something familiar\\, or their pet theory answered.\\nRian took us away from that\\, and gave us unexpected things.\\nSo good for the Star Wars fan base\\, though it has made some people uncomfortable.","true":true}
