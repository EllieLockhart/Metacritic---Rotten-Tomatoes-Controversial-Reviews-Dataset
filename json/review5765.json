Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointed and has killed my interest and support(movies \\, merchandise\\, games etc) of new trilogy completely. The original characters deserved better.  If you haven't watched this\\, don't. At least The Force Awakens had mystery\\, and despite its flaws it had potential. How can you mess up Star Wars so bad?? These new movies are hollow and miss the heart and charm of what makes universe special. At least Rogue one was a worthy effort!","true":true}
