Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Definitely a better movie compared to The Force Awakens. The story hits a few bumps in the road. The pacing was great. The action was great. Disney still can't quite hit the mark in regards to the \\\"Bad guys\\\" like Lucasfilm did in the original trilogy. The comedy could have been played down a little in a few parts. Overall an enjoyable fun sequel!","true":true}
