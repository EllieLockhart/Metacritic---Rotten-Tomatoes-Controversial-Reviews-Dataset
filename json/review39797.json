Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is an incredibly well made movie. It provides a fresh perspective on the galaxy at large. It is full or major and minor twists. It's not what you would expect\\, and it is increasingly evident that most people get upset when they don't get what they expect. Have an open mind. Respect a story not told from the cookie cutter mould. There is only one disappointment in this film\\, which can easily be overlooked if you look at it from the right perspective\\, and rather than taking it at face value\\, look at it for what it could be\\, and become. Five stars!...six if I could!","true":true}
