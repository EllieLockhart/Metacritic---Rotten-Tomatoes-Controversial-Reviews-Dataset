Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The fact that anyone would hand such a sacred franchise to a hack that's more interested in serving themselves and making their own mark on the franchise is ludicrous. This movie upends a chunk of my childhood in a couple of hours. You can't just change the whole dynamic of characters\\, make them behave completely abnormally\\, and pretend you're a creative genius. I'd rather watch the holiday special.","true":true}
