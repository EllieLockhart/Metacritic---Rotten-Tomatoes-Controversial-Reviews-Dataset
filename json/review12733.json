Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I created an account just so I could rate this movie. To say I disliked it is an understatement. I gave it one and a half Stars just because the title of the movie is Star Wars. What they did with Luke's character is unforgivable. His big accomplishment was providing a distraction. I like the way Chris Pratt did it in Guardians of the Galaxy much better (dance off). At least after he was done he kicked some butt instead of dying from exhaustion. ","true":true}
