Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Before I begin my review\\, please note that I am a true Star Wars fan. I saw Star Wars IV at least three times the first week out at age 11. This episode was just okay. I give it a C to C+. Luke\\, Leia\\, Chewy\\, and the Millineum Falcon....truly nostalgic. We need George Lucas Back and Disney out!!!! The plot was choppy and the ending was poorly done. Episode VII had a much better plot. Who ever placed this episode in the category with The Empire Strikes Back was sadly mistaken.","true":true}
