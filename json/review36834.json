Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was action packed but I felt the story was seriously lacking\\, the easy quick death of snoke\\, and the let down of a reveal about Rey's parents and a big chunk of the movie spent on a rebel ship running away from the bad guys.","true":true}
