Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved the movie. Stuck to its roots. And was a film that relived the magic of Star Wars. Yes it took risks but it stuck to the lore that made Star Wars Star Wars. Be open minded and realize that surprises are necessary to continue enjoying these types of films. In my opinion\\, it was in line with the Empire Strikes Back. Same tone\\, humor\\, pace\\, darkness and surprises. Don't go into this movie with your own expectations and rules and you'll enjoy it as much as I did!","true":true}
