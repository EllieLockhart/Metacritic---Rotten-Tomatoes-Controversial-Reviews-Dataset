Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I prefer to be entertained rather than lectured to about gender politics. A dismal plodding story line that wilfully flips the bird at Star Wars fans.","true":true}
