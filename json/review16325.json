Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not sure which movie these negative audience reviewers saw.  My guess is that the vast majority of them are trolls.  Easily the best entry since Empire\\, and quite possibly superior even to that.","true":true}
