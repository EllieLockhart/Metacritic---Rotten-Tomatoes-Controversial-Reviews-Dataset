Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lots of things wrong with this movie. Totally understand the transistion to the next generation\\, but the Luke send-off was horrible. How can you have a Star Wars movie without a light-saber duel? Felt a piece of my childhood die with this movie.","true":true}
