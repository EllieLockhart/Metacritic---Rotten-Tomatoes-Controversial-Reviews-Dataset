Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"On purpose they have destroyed the Star Wars franchise are and laughingly taking our money. I will never pay for another Star Wars movie at the theater. I was almost 10 years old when episode 4 first came out. I have waited decades to see the fulfillment of the Skywalker story and Disney gives us PC drivel. Women and men can be strong characters together. I am a woman and offended how weak males were portrayed. Luke Skywalker is a hero and Disney destroyed his legacy. Movie was a mess on so many levels. RIP Star Wars.","true":true}
