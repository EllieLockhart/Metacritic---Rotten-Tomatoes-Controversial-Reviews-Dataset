Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Maybe not as good as The Force Awakens\\, but still very fun. Some of the humour was out of place for a Star Wars film\\, but I did like that there was more humour\\, even if it was a bit odd.\\nThe lightsaber battles were excellent\\, as were the flying sequences\\, and it was great to have Luke Skywalker back.\\nSome of the story was a bit unnecessary\\, as they seemed to be just creating story for characters that they could have skipped (Finn's stuff with the girl\\, bleh).\\nI liked the Rey-Kylo dynamic\\, I'm hoping for more moral struggles in the next film.\\nA good movie\\, although maybe a bit long.\\nWatched at Chinook with Sam\\, Priscilla\\, Tim\\, Amelia\\, Keefe\\, Jordan\\, Ken\\, and Irene on December 25\\, 2017 (Christmas Day movie with Sam's family).","true":true}
