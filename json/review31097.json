{"101487":167963,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-29","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So I will judge this movie in two ways\\, as a stand-alone and as a movie that's part of the Star Wars story.\\nStandalone: This movie was absolutely stunning in regards to audio and visuals. Snoke's Throne Room actually seemed pretty dark which I liked and the use of silence through the kamikaze scene was remarkable. The acting was top notch (I didn't like Rose as a character but she was a great actress). The kissing scene\\, \\\"Forced\\\" notions and humor really detracted from this movie. That kiss was so bad I just felt so awkward after it. I appreciate promoting women in power\\, however this was just way too forced and basically damned every male character in this movie while promoting female characters (again\\, I like promoting women but damning the males was uncalled for). Luke's milking was so off as well and shouldn't be there\\, I remember all the looks people had on their faces in the theater and it wasn't pleasant. The Leia scene was horrible and laughable actually. They took something interesting with Kylo not shooting and turned it into a laughable Marry Poppins. The offscreen killing of Admiral Ackbar was an abomination to such a great character. The amount of plot holes were abundant and it almost felt like the director didn't even watch his own movie after he finished. The Porgs were pointless and didn't even have a purpose like the Ewoks did in Episode 6. Overall\\, great characters and audio and visuals with a horrible and unrevised script.\\n\\nAs a Star Wars Movie: It didn't expand at all on what we know. None of the questions posed in The Force Awakens were answered and instead were literally thrown away. I get as the middle movie there really shouldn't be that many questions answered\\, but there was absolutely NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. I feel so detached from the characters that I actually just don't care when they die\\, fight\\, etc. The middle movie is supposed to build on the character yet they don't do any of this. In Episode 5\\, Luke actually trains with Yoda for what can be predicted as several months\\, at least we can see some progression here. With Rey\\, the training was literally \\\"Reach out to the force\\\"\\, and a little lightsaber swinging. That's it?! How can you explain a Jedi that never actually trained can beat a sith that trained for what seems several years of his life (Kylo training with Luke) as well as with a much more  powerful Sith in Snoke. At most Rey trained for as little as 18 hours which is the amount of fuel the Resistance had left. This movie shuns anything Star Wars created and tries to come up with its own thing which it shouldn't. \\n\\nI left the theater feeling happy at first\\, but when I went back to think I couldn't have been more disappointed. This gets 1 and 1\/2 stars because the movie somehow made me happy at the end\\, but I hated the plot holes\\, the sub plot to Canto Bight which was absolutely pointless and could have been avoided\\, and the many forced instances in the movie. It was almost as if everything was a set piece in this movie and nothing occurred naturally. I even expected the \\\"Snoke Scene\\\". Oh well\\, I'll watch Episode 9 to see if they redeem themselve\\, but I was thoroughly disappointed with this movie. In the end\\, go see it just to see it\\, but don't hold your expectations high.","true":true}
