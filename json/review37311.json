Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The plot is shit\\, cannot compare to the splendid visual effect\\, excellent acting. I feel all the great acting is wasted with their bad lines. Nothing it started\\, I did not predict it happens. There is no suspense\\, climax\\, plot twists or memorable lines. A complete waste of a such a big budget film. Please pay the writer more\\, and find someone who can plot well\\, before getting all the talents together","true":true}
