Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What ultimately destroyed this film was its deep misunderstanding of the character Luke Skywalker. \\n\\nPerhaps a better film could have made a story about Luke being some kind of a reluctant hero\\, especially after enduring a traumatic event like he did. \\n\\nThis movie\\, however\\, appeared engineered to deconstruct the childhood hero of multiple generations. We wanted to see a wise and powerful master\\, what we got was a whiny coward who hid for thirty years and then died of tiredness. \\n\\nIf the only problem in the movie had been Luke's storyline\\, it MIGHT even be fixable in a sequel somehow... but the issues in this film run deeper than just an essential character they didn't get. The whole thing feels like it wants to run Star Wars off the rails. It was a bloated\\, confusing mess. \\n\\nReminded me of the Matrix sequels\\, or Valerian and the City of 1000 Planets. Interesting ideas\\, amateurishly executed.\\n\\nThe prequels weren't very good\\, and everyone knows that. But at least with those\\, they couldn't really take away from the characters we loved from the original trilogy. Messing with Luke and Leia (and Han Solo) diminishes the originals\\, and nobody wants that. If you want to get experimental with Star Wars\\, make up your own characters to do it with. My friends who loved this movie love pretty much anything they watch at any given time. They're not the most discerning of customers.","true":true}
