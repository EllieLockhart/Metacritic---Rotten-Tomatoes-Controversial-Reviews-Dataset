Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"#RIPStarWars\\n\\nYes\\, it's a hashtag and it's trending on twitter.\\n\\nDisney destroyed Star Wars after it was abused by its creator in the second three movies.\\n\\nMark Hamill should never have agreed to \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" which\\, fyi\\, was the name of the last of the first three movies before it was 'changed' last minute.\\n\\n#DisneyDestorysMostStories\\n\\nOh well\\, I will rewrite it in my head.","true":true}
