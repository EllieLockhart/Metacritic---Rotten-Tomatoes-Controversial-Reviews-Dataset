Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Decent Movie. I was excited to go to the opening night\\, left empty watched it again and its a decent movie nothing amazing or if it was it was drowned but the too many comedic parts\\, and Silly main plot. I thought TFA was much better and this was a average continuation.","true":true}
