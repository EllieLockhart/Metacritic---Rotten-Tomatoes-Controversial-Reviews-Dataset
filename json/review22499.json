Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Let go of the past\\\"-Kylo .....Long time Star Wars fans have to do the same. The SW movies of the past (not counting prequels) are classics. But this is a new day and age a new future for our beloved characters...in Force Awakens and Last Jedi our characters are older and have to adjust to the times its a whole new galaxy with new enemies. With that said this movie goes into a new direction phasing out our old heroes and presenting the new future heroes of Star Wars. Only weakness in this movie is the whole Finn\/Casino plot line...a waste of time that slows down the movie. Audience\/Fans have to let go of the luke we all know and accept this older yet wiser one.","true":true}
