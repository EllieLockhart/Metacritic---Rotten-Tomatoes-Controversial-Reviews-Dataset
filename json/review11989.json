Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely hate everything about this movie\\, from the cheap Saturday Night Live comedy to the total disrespect of the Star Wars lore and it's fans!   Luke Skywalker was treated like a grumpy old man!  Laura Dern's character was a total joke and embarrassment!  There was absolutely nothing I liked about this movie!  And FYI I am not an alt- right\\, woman-hating Neo Nazi!  I am a very liberal Democrat!","true":true}
