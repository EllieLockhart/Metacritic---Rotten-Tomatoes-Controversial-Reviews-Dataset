Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"as a star wars movie goes\\, this is the worst. it did not advance the plot anywhere. was cheesy and answers none of the questions the were asked before seeing this movie. I suggest waiting till it comes out on Redbox and seeing it then for cheap. it is also not a very cinematic movie good enough for the price of a theater ticket.","true":true}
