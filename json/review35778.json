Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is far from a perfect Star Wars movie\\, but when it's good\\, it's awesome.\\n\\nWarning: this review has spoilers.\\n\\nSpoilers\\, spoilers\\, spoilers.\\n\\nIf you don't want spoilers\\, stop reading.\\n\\nReally\\, there are spoilers below\\, so stop if you don't want any.\\n\\nMaybe 20 to 30 more minutes could've been culled - from what was reportedly already a movie trimmed from 3+ hours to it's current 2 1\/2 hour running time.  Most of the running around in Finn and Rose's wild goose chase on behalf of Poe's half-baked escape plan\\, for example\\, could've hit the cutting room floor\\, and we'd have been none the wiser and a little less in need of the bathroom on exiting the screen at the end.\\n\\nAfter everything\\, it's also not clear exactly what the point of Snoke was\\, except to provide a vehicle for Kylo Ren to fulfil the destiny of every good Sith apprentice - that of knocking off his\/her master and assuming their position.\\n\\nThat's got the awkward bits out of the way\\, and the rest is great.  The two or three biggest twists all work well.\\n\\nLuke shows that all that studying under Yoda has paid off with the single greatest Force stunt ever pulled (note: Force projection is\/was canon\\, per the Legends\/old Extended Universe - and it was just as exhausting as shown\\, no wonder Luke took an extended leave of absence after).\\n\\nThe Rey's parents' reveal isn't exactly on a par with \\\"I am your father\\\"\\, but\\, well\\, so what? I think it's more of a let-down - and an insult - to Kylo Ren that Rey came from \\\"nothing\\\" and \\\"nobody\\\".  He wants her to be his equal not in just the Force\\, but in bloodline.  That she isn't\\, and she accepts it\\, is a slap in his face\\, and makes him detest her even more.  It fuels his rage.\\n\\nFinally\\, Poe's realization that his daft plan was all for naught and that the Admiral knew what she was doing all along (and so\\, apparently\\, did Leia) just underlines the whole pointlessness of Poe and Finn and Rose's heist arc.  Still\\, the look on his face as he is finally\\, genuinely\\, taken down a peg or two is priceless.\\n\\nOh\\, and Porgs rule\\, as do most of the other crazy lifeforms inhabiting Luke's rock.","true":true}
