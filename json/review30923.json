Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointed\\, annoying \\\"jokes\\\" all the way through\\, not a single serious moment allowed to settle before another gag mixed in with tedious subplots. Every question I had going in had a poor conclusion. A speech from Luke to Rey about what the force really is\\, which the film then completely ignores. I saw double screening with TFA shown first and for a next chapter\\, this felt all wrong. First time I have ever left cinema from a new SW film and not wanted to see it again straight away.","true":true}
