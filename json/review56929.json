Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The storyline made little sense. Some of the events which occurred destroyed long standing in physics in the universe. Sci fi films work on the necessity that they are at least consistent internally to the logic of the lore.  \\n\\nWhen one ship hyperspacing can destroy entire fleets\\, why wasn't that used against the death star to save entire planets and millions of lives?  \\n\\nPlus Bos action make little sense\\, the case scene sub plot is cheesy\\, too long and has no effect on the final plot.","true":true}
