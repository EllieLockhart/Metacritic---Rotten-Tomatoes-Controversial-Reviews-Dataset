Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it!! It gave us something new while giving us everything we love about this world already. It expanded the universe further and took the story in a direction I don't think anyone saw coming. Sure\\, there's some plot threads that feel unnecessarily long and don't really go anywhere but the central focus of the clear and it challenges our perceptions of how this universe works which I love.\\nCan't wait for IX now.","true":true}
