Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Almost all of the dialogue is used to foreshadow the expectations of subsequent scenes. In other words all dialogue progresses the plot exclusively instead of providing character depth and backstory or proving character development. The first 45 minutes are a jumble of action scenes and missed humor (or good childish kicks). I understand that we are making movies to be accessible to kids too but I feel like that bottlenecks the potential depth and subtext of scenes that appeal to older audiences. All in all\\, Star Wars is dead to me. My children will love it\\, but I don't.","true":true}
