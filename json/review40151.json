Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not Luke Skywalker. They Fucked him up. You can't deny that. That's the biggest issue. Remember how he gave himself to Vader and the Emperor knowing that he might die because he knew the greatest villain in movie history could be redeemed? Yet in this movie\\, he's afraid and wants to kill his Nephew\\, his family? Come on.","true":true}
