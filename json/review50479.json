Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"1 & 1\/2 stars for SPFX. So horribly written. It was as though they threw every Star Wars movie into the garbage. No character development. No one to identify with other than Kylo. There were two plots - the skywalker\/rey\/kylo portion was tolerable ...and then there was the moronic slow speed space chase which diverted to some space horse racing thing and had so many holes and was painful. God this movie was awful. ","true":true}
