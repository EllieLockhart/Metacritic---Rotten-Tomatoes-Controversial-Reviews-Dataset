{"101487":170065,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-29","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi. A film that features more jedi than the original trilogy did. And\\, it was pretty good. Not perfect\\, but pretty good. I loved this film visually\\, and all the performances were pretty great\\, especially Hamill\\, Driver\\, and Ridley. Also\\, I loved that literally forced connection between Kylo and Rey and all of the scenes on the island are\\, for the most part\\, great. But\\, unfortunately\\, there are issues that do distract from all that goodness. Like that kind of annoying and basically pointless side quest that Finn and Rose go on. And\\, while we are on it\\, lets talk about Rose. Her character and her relationship with Finn in this film\\, I feel\\, is much like the relationship between that one elf and that one dwarf in the hobbit trilogy. It's kind of bland and almost pointless and every scene that involves just them drags. I didn't like that forced animal abuse is bad message they were trying to cram down our throats and I didn't like all that other social commentary that occured during that scene and I didn't like how the casino looked. It felt way to prequelish for comfort (meaning lazy like the 50s diner in episode 2). I wouldn't have cared about it that much if 1 it didn't distract all the stuff that was happening on the island and 2 if it was a Star Wars film. But it is what it is\\, I guess. Pointless\\, because it does go nowhere. I guess that it was suppose to show that heros aren't always right\\, and I would be ok with that if it actually had support and belief. For example: In Empire when Han was wrong to trust Lando in the beginning\\, it was actually believable and done well with characters we cared about\\, but in The Last Jedi it was because the purple haired Jurrasic Park lady didn't tell Poe what was going on in order to teach him a lesson that just ended with him taking over the ship when it could've all been prevented if she just told him what they were doing. And\\, with that many problems just to create more suspense\\, it distracts more than it gives\\, much like Finn and Roses side quest. Also\\, that part during that climax where Rose sacrifices herself to prevent Finn from sacrificing himself to save the resistance was stupid. Because\\, her reason was about saving the one she loved and not fighting the ones she hated\\, even though she could've\\, and hopefully did\\, die due to saving Finn from sacrificing himself\\, so either way someone is losing someone they love making her little moral BS\\, especially in that situation. So\\, with all of these flaws (including the ridiculous super Leia scene and Porg overload) I still really enjoyed this film\\, because it does have an emotionally invested story that rhymes with previous entries\\, which is what Lucas said the star wars films should do\\, and it builds on the Star Wars universe by adding all sorts of new things like force projection\\, which was pretty cool and force telekinesis which was also pretty cool\\, because if the force is so powerful than it should do more than peoject lightning\\, move rocks\\, and make someone change their mind and do flips. So\\, in the end\\, it was great except for when it was kind of dumb\\, and all of the controversy just proves what Ego was ralking about at the end of Ratatouille. P.S. I'm glad Snoke is dead\\, but I would've liked at least some form of exposition (and no not a damn book!).","true":true}
