Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Extremely disappointing. This may beat Attack of the Clones as my least favorite Star Wars film. First\\, the dialogue and the story are both incredibly flat and boring. The film tried to be funny much too often\\, which often came across awkward. And after sitting through what felt like an eternity\\, nothing really seemed to be said. Like a dream where you run and run only to exhaustedly turn and find you've only traveled a few feet. Sure\\, things happened\\, but nothing was interesting or compelling. Everything was just flat. It is hard to go into the many\\, many flaws of the movie without spoilers\\, but this movie was a complete disaster. While each scene viewed in isolation may seem like a genuine part of an epic Star Wars film\\, when splattered together across a two and a half hour nightmare the film sputters and dies\\, never really grabbing its audience. I felt nothing for the characters. I had no interest in the story. The only upside to the film is that the actors did an amazing job with what was written for them. The shame of it all is there are bits and pieces that would be amazing concepts in the Star Wars universe if they weren't suffocated by an uninspired script.","true":true}
