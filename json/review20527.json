Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019ve come to understand that many people are not fans of this film\\, but I happen to completely disagree with them. I think that the popular opinion of this film has led many to a similar conclusion without giving it a second thought. It captivated me from beginning to end\\, and it made me feel something which is how I grade films most of all. There are particular moments I think are idiotic\\, but it isn\u2019t something that recurs throughout the picture so I can\u2019t hold this against it. Give it a chance I beg of you\\, and please go into it with an open mind.","true":true}
