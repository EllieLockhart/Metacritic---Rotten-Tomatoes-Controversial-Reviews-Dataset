Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love Rian Johnson's previous work\\, so I was beyond ecstatic to see what he could offer the Star Wars universe. Apparently\\, he was more concerned with political undertones and lecturing his audience on the evils of being rich than he was with actually telling a compelling story. There were many scenes from The Last Jedi that I absolutely loved\\, but there were many scenes that took me so far out of the movie\\, I practically forgot what I was watching. I don't appreciate political agendas smeared into my entertainment\\, especially when that entertainment is Star Wars.","true":true}
