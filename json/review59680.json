Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"First of all\\, thanks for makeing me to join in metacritic. Through this\\, I thought to try more game reviews.\r\rWhy is this the Last of Earth Part 2? All of the character and personality of the characters in Part 1 are only Ellie's cursing and sexual identity. Joel became senile dementia\\, and Ellie forgot the expression and memories of her last part 1.\rThis continues in part 2. Tommy told Maria to stop Eli's revenge\\, but later appeared suddenly and asked to take revenge. Abby was the character who justified Eli's sacrifice and became very angry when a colleague died. Later\\, however\\, she kills a colleague herself to save a rev.\r\rI tried to show through Elie that revenge is chained and only emptiness remains\\, but Eli didn't take revenge. After stopping revenge\\, Elie loses her father\\,  friends\\, families\\, and her finger. Abby\\, who was cleanly revenged\\, was forgiven and returned to fireflies with her companion Rev. Even looking at this alone\\, revenge seems better.\r\rThe game-play was not bad and the graphics were good\\, but I think the most important thing in the last of us is the story. I removed 7 points from the story. And I removed one more point from the rainbow and Jewish symbols not needed.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
