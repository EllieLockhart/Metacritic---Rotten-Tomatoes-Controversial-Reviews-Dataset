Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good movie but doesn't do the original films justice\\, far too many subplots and some aspects of the movie were a little hard to understand why they were even happening. Visually stunning and some amazing lightsaber battles\\, however the main plot of the film was rather boring for a star wars movie\\, hoping episode nine will be a step in the right direction.","true":true}
