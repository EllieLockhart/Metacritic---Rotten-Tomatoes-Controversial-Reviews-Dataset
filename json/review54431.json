Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went in spoiled and worried but in the end I liked it. Yes it felt like 7.5 rather than 8\\, yes Rian wasted Snoke\\, yes Luke has changed\\, yes to much on the gags\\, yes the Finn and Roses trip was worthless. But in the end I liked it. I have read almost every Star Wars book\\, Empire was the first movie I ever saw in the theaters I love this franchise but I don't own it. Sometimes Disney or George Lucas do things without my permission and well I'll have to live with that or take up writing fan fiction. I really believe that if you give this movie a chance and set aside your preconceived notions you will find a good movie. It's not the greatest but it beats most the prequels.","true":true}
