Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a fan of Star Wars my whole life (I'm 42 years old).  I tolerated the prequels and still watch them every now and then.  I was excited about Star Wars \\\"The Force Awakens\\\"  and looked forward to see the future of my favorite franchise.   BUT what Disney has done in this latest film is completely awful and can never be taken back.  Why in hell would they ruin the original characters of this franchise.   I really don't know what to say expect this is a sad day for Star Wars Fans across the galaxy.","true":true}
