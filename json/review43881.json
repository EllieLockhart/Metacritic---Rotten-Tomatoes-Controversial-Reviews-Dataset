Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Those of you who rated this movie 5 stars should get your brain examined. Although most of you are Disney henchmen trying to drive the audience score back up I'm sure. This movie made me want to gouge my eyeballs out of my head and throw them at the screen. Luke is so out of character I'm just in total shock. Why would he even think about killing his nephew (even for a second) when he wouldn't even kill his Father in Return of the Jedi. Oh this movie makes my angry. More angry than the prequels made me. There are about 20\\,000 more things wrong with this film but I wont bore you with details that thousands have already pointed out. Oh and hey\\, to the critics that gave this steaming pile of trash 91%. All i can say is I hope the fat check by the new evil empire was big enough to cover the cost of your dignity. Join me and the rest of the true rebels and don't give this shit company anymore of your hard earned money.","true":true}
