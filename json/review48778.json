Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst movie of the franchise. Complete spits on everything before it and rendered all the events of the OT and PT utterly meaningless. Which would be fine if it was for a good reason\\, but it wasn't. The only reason seems to be to keep the money making status quo and play off nostalgia and keep raking in the dough as the cost of a even half decent story. Just terrible. Pretty\\, but terrible.","true":true}
