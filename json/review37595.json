Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is no negative feedback I can add that hasn't already been said. Except\\, for others who feel Disney destroyed this franchise (at least the latest trilogy)  should post their displeasure. The Last Jedi\\, yes I do believe this movie may be the last Jedi movie I ever pay to see. Thank you Disney.. I only fear what changes you have in mind for Deadpool andX-Neb now that you have their rights too.","true":true}
