Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was very excited to see this movie\\, however\\, left very disappointed.  The Johnson's vision of Luke's character transformed Luke from one of the greatest Jedi's tp a wimp.  Also\\, Rey with no training\\, is able to battle Luke\\, and Caedus.  Lea flys through space like superman\\, the movie overall is very disjointed.  I feel diseny should have created 7\\,8and 9 generations after episdoe 6\\, then goine back and done stand alone films to close the han\\, luke and leia stories.  Also\\, there was misplaced comedy in my opinion.  So far\\, the transition from 7 to 8 feels very disjointed.  Hopefully JJ Abrams can somehow salvage this trilogy.  This movie also has a lack of character development.  For example\\, we are introduced to a code breaker who will sell to the highest bidder (if he turns out to be another palpatine in episode 9 that would make for a cool twist)\\, female bounty hunter who also gets killed at he end of the movie (again\\, it seems like build up that she is a character to fear and then she gets killed) Snoke- another buildup he is to be feared - he tosses Rey around like a rag doll\\, something we never saw Palpatine do\\, but then Caedus slices him in half with a lightsaber with no fight- My take on JOnhson is he is probably good at stand alone movies\\, but not at developing characters for a trilogy.  Also\\, very disappointed in Kathleen Kennedy's direction of these three films so far - not impressed.  Rouge One - that was fantastic and up there with the original 3.  Save your money on this film and go see Jumanji 2 instead","true":true}
