Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Intense\\, bold\\, emotional\\, surprisingly unexpected in a good way\\, funny and incredibly dynamic. The performances are stunning\\, the characters are complex and  turmoil as hell\\, the new creatures are cool as well as the new characters\\, the effects are awesome and the photography is terrific. Luke's final scene is poetic (also Yoda's). The storyline is opening the door for a multitude of possibilities to the saga. The Last Jedi is fantastic and a breath of fresh air to the franchise\\, I absolutely loved it!","true":true}
