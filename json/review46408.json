Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was really excited to see the return of Luke on the big screen. I have never been so disappointed in my life. Not only this movie disappoint on a level I have never expected\\, it also destroys the lore of Star Wars.","true":true}
