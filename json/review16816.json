Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In short: This film\\, while looking georgious\\, totally ignores the previous film's questions and plots while also ignoring the lore and rules of the entire franchise\\, all the while with a basic and lazily written plot that rehashes \\\"Empire Strikes Back\\\" (ESB).\\n\\nFrom the start the movie (somewhat) picks up where \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" (TFA) left off. Hux is chasing the Resistance which now fits into one ship and the First Order (FO) is now apparently as big and powerful as the old Empire with its seemingly unlimited resources. \\n\\nHux is mocked by Poe and made to look foolish. A battle ensues in which Resistance bombers move at a crawling speed and are easily destroyed. The bomber must open the bay doors and use a handheld remote to drop the bombs as she is exposed to the vacuum of space with no gear or helmet but is fine. Poe disobeys a retreat order and gets all of the bombers killed but still has a bomber hit the target\\, but is still demoted for this. The Resistance ship jumps to lightspeed but the FO appears right behind because now they can track the ship even through lightspeed\\, but it is never explained how. Now the Resistance is really in a pickle much like the Millennium Falcon in ESB because they are running out of fuel with lightspeed being no option for escape. Kylo Ren (whose training to be completed by Snoke apparently was just being berated by him for losing to Rey) and some other short range fighters are able to easily enter and blow up the ship's hangar full of fighters and bridge which kills Admiral Ackbar and knocks Leia out into the vacuum of space who then uses the force to pull herself back to the ship while the crew opens a door that leads to the vacuum of space to let her back in without any decompression. Leia goes into a coma and what ensues is an OJ Ford Bronco style chase as the FO with many ships does nothing but chase behind the ship for however many hours until the Resistance runs out of fuel. Despite having seemingly unlimited resources\\, the FO is either too arrogant or dumb to flank the ship thereby giving the Resistance time to enact a plan. Lucky for the FO\\, the new person in charge of Leia's absence\\, Holdo\\, seemingly has no viable plan other than to fly as far as the fuel will allow and then abandon the crew in smaller ships to escape\\, to which Poe rightfully says that the FO will pick the escape vessels apart. So Poe secretly sends Finn on a mission to deactivate the lightspeed tracker. Finn teams up with Rose to obtain the person needed to get them into the enemy ship\\, which drags on until they fail\\, but it was worth it according to Finn because they freed some animals being used for racing. Back to the Resistance ship\\, Leia wakes up and stops Poe trying to take over the ship and relates they actually had a plan all along to abandon to a nearby old base which renders Finn's quest pointless\\, but since Holdo refused to tell the plan to the guy who just destroyed Starkiller Base who also had reason to suspect she was a traitor\\, Finn's quest happens only to fail further by being betrayed by another person who claimed he could help but actually relates the newly discovered plan to the FO. So as they abandon ship to travel to the base\\, the FO starts destroying the ships as Poe had feared. Remember that all this would have been avoided had Holdo just told Poe the plan. So after 90% of the Resistance getaway ships are destroyed\\, Holdo\\, who stayed with the main ship\\, then decides to lightspeed the ship into the FO and destroy it. Which begs the questions: Why did she wait until 90% of her crew were destroyed? Why didn't she use an autopilot to do this? Why has this never been done before in any Star Wars film\\, especially against Death Stars and Star Destroyers? Wow. So she saves a couple hundred who make it to the base. A Hoth battle ensues in which a \\\"battering\\\" weapon protected by a couple dozen walkers slowly approaches the base that has no exit other than the entrance. The Resistance attack with ancient speeders but are no match for the walkers so Poe calls them off\\, but Finn decides to make the ultimate sacrifice to save the ones he loves\\, but Rose stops him because she says war is about saving the ones you love...So now the two are sitting ducks miles away from the base but just forget that detail.\\nBefore I finish\\, let's discuss Rey's pointless plot during all of this. She finds Luke only to have him be a grumpy old man who doesn't want to help even though there was a map to him and the whole point of TFA was to find him. She learns basically nothing from him other than he drew his lightsaber in a moment in which he intended to kill his nephew Ben in his sleep because he sensed some dark in him despite Luke refusing to kill Darth Vader in ROTJ. So she leaves after we discover her parents were junkers who sold her for drinking money so apparently she's so skilled with the force and lightsabers because the plot calls for it. She then goes to turn Ren to the light. Ren brings her to Snoke who uses incredible mastery of the force to control and mock her before Ren cheap shots him with Rey's lightsaber by using the force. So Snoke dies without any story of where he came from and how he established the FO. Rey somehow escapes and boards the Falcon to help the remaining Resistance trapped at the base.\\nBack at the base all hope seems lost until Luke shows up to save the day as he walks toward the FO weapon and walkers whose blasts have no effect on him. Ren approaches to duel him. Luke uses \\\"Matrix\\\" style dodges until Ren lands a blow that has no effect on him. We then learn Luke is force \\\"astral projecting\\\" himself to stall the FO to allow the Resistance to escape. Fortunately Rey shows up and moves a mound of boulders to allow the few remaining Resistance to escape. Luke then dies.\\n\\nIn conclusion this movie is a disgrace to the Star Wars franchise and tramples the legacy of Luke and is full of plot holes and lazy storytelling. It serves no purpose as being the second act of this trilogy other than to kill off characters with a whimper (and most of the Resistance) and further portray Rey as a \\\"Mary Sue\\\" that requires no training.","true":true}
