Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a fan of the sacred Original Trilogy\\, I had to weigh in on this one. This movie was  slap in the face to all fans of Star Wars and Mark Hamill in particular. Minimizing the the role of the Original Trilogy characters was demeaning and an obvious power play by the people in charge. Disney needs to take a long hard look at who is making this crap and clean house before the franchise is truly dead. Some good writing\\, good direction and a focus on the George Lucas' actual Star Wars universe instead of pushing a political agenda is needed. I'm sorry that my hard earned money went to support this garbage. I wanted to give this a 0 star rating but couldn't.","true":true}
