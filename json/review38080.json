Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The story was abysmal. Not even sure what the story actually accomplished. Just a drawn out snail fest. Wasn't really any point to the plot what so ever.\\n\\nThe acting just... why do I care about Rey? Whats Finn's purpose? Who was the asian chick again? Snoke doesnt make for much of a bad guy... Kylo throws more emo fits... Luke must have died at the end of episode 6\\, not sure who that was.","true":true}
