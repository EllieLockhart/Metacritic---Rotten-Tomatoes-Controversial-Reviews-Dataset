Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Left the theater thoroughly disappointed. Acting wise\\, I think everyone deserves kudos...\\n\\nPros:\\n- Luke\\, Kylo and Rey's acting abilities\\n- Red dudes vs Kylo and Rey\\n- Suicide mission of bombers in the beginning\\n- Telepathy scenes between Kylo and Rey\\n\\nCons:\\n- Prank call in the beginning \\n- Porgs (utterly useless and distracting)\\n- Didn't feel like a Star Wars movie \\n- Casino planet pointless mission\\n- Benicio Del Toro character \\n- Luke wanting to kill Kylo if only for a second?\\n- Death of Snoke with no explanation\\n- Carrie Fisher unanswered questions \\n- Silver Trooper lady pointless death\\n- Humor not similar to previous Star Wars movies","true":true}
