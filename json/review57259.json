Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had no point.  It was a series of scenes jumbled together without a thought to how it advanced a plot.  There was an opportunity to have a plot\\, but it got sidetracked by scenes that had little to do with the resolution of the movie. And that's resolution was remarkably unsatisfying.   When you find yourself distracted by the lighted exit signs to the side of the screen and there's a lot of action going on in the screen\\, I'd say that's evidence of a bad movie.  It made me want to watch Episodes 1-3\\, which at least tried to do something interesting.","true":true}
