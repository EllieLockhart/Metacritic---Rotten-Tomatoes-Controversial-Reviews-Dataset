Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ryan was courageous. He took the franchise to directions never before taken. Some choices were naturally not the best. The jokes are not good\\, and Luke ar first felt really odd. But the second half of the movies grows bigger than all the flaws and becomes too epic to be ignored.","true":true}
