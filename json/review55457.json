Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Misplaced humor\\, and huge plot holes. Characters joking around with their droids as hundreds of people are being blown up\\, it makes zero sense. I\ufe0f love Andy Serkis\\, but Snokes CGI face and character in general was built poorly. Love the actors\\, and I\ufe0f love Mark Hamill\\, but not the direction they forced him to go in. Even Hamill is having a difficult time excepting which direction Luke\u2019s character went in. I\u2019m sorry to say it was directed horribly\\, and this is coming from someone that thinks Rian Johnson is a great director. Hopefully this is a M. Night Shyamalan \u201cThe Last Airbender\u201d moment\\, and hopefully Rian will bounce back and make something good again. I\ufe0f almost feel like a child for crapping on this movie so much\\, especially knowing a lot of my friends loved this movie. No\\, I\u2019m not one of those fans that can never be satisfied\\, I thought Rough One was an absolute delight\\, and I\ufe0f cried my little eyes out during it. Not trying to be negative but I\ufe0f really was disappointed. I\u2019d rather watch the Phantom Menace. Yep\\, I\ufe0f said it. ","true":true}
