{"101487":112869,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-02","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Changed from 1\/2 star to 1 star to allow my rating to be included in the audience score.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi was a shallow\\, thoughtless 2 1\/2 hour-long showcase of special effects\\, jokes\\, and a nonstop alternating theme\/pattern of expectation and subversion.\\n\\nI had no personal expectations for this movie other than those created by the allusions made in The Force Awakens. TFA alluded to a certain level of unrevealed history pertaining mainly to Supreme Leader Snoke\\, Rey\\, Kylo Ren\\, and the Knights of Ren (to a lesser extent\\, this list also includes Luke Skywalker's role-to-be and General Leia's fate).\\n\\nAnd so my only expectations were to have some of these mysteries revealed. In fact\\, I was originally planning on waiting and renting the movie later when it was released on DVD but I worried that some of these answers might be spoiled for me. For this reason\\, I saw TLJ in theaters. Much to my disappointment\\, I had wasted my time; TLJ provided very little in response to the TFA's allusions. To make a long story short\\, there was nothing to spoil.\\n\\nTLJ completely subverted most of these allusions and provided shallow explanations for the rest of them. Snoke is killed with zero description of his past and how he became the Supreme Leader. Rey is told by Kylo Ren that she has no relevant past (something with which I would be okay had TFA not alluded to a more complex\\, interesting explanation). Luke is a very different character in contrast to the original trilogy. Leia is shown to almost die but then survives in the most laughably ridiculous scene I have ever witnessed in an A-movie. All of the characters from the original trilogy either play insignificant roles or are killed\\, essentially deeming them irrelevant.\\n\\nAs for the politics\/diversity about which many people have complained\\, I only agree slightly. I have zero care as to what races or what sexes are portrayed as long as it isn't so blatant and annoying that it detracts from my experience. Some of this did exist in TLJ\\, especially the nearly-all-pasty-white-male\\, nazi-like First Order. But I would even be able to ignore this had the movie simply been good enough to keep me interested in the plot rather than stupid details like this.\\n\\nMy last point pertains to the constant subversion of expectations within the movie itself. Almost every time that the movie suggested an outcome\\, it would then surprise the audience with a different\\, unexpected outcome instead. Rose saves Finn\\, Finn and Rose are caught and DJ betrays them\\, Leia survives\\, Luke throws the lightsaber\\, Luke is projecting himself\\, etc. One or two of these surprises would have been fine but there were so many of the in TLJ that I ended up actually expecting them. The worst of these was when I knew Finn wouldn't die in his attempt at self-sacrifice (but boy did I want him to).\\n\\nI have other small issues such as Kylo Ren's lack of intimidation (I want to see him ruthlessly kill a lot of important\\, powerful people just so I might perceive him as threatening). Rey has no gratitude for her powers (I want to see her work for her abilities--no pain\\, no gain).\\n\\nOverall\\, it was a bad movie as a standalone\\, a horrible movie as a Star Wars installment\\, and a complete insult as a cohesive unit alongside The Force Awakens. It was a complete waste of time and money. I am going to read the extended universe books.","true":true}
