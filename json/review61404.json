Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Visuals\/Production:\rThe Last of Us Part 2 is one of the most beautiful game graphically in this generation so far. The depiction of post apocalyptic America is top notch. Acting and sounds is also great. Something all of us expected from the beginning.\r\rVisuals and Productions: 8\/10\r\rStory:\rThe Last of Us Part 2 failed miserably on its story telling. Character's decision sometimes felt forced and out of their usual character making it feel like the story is rushed and lacked with natural development. Most of the new characters felt flat and\rnot relateable. The story itself is riddled with plot holes that is sometimes plainly laughable something you do not expect after the success of the first game. It didn't also helped that I was forced to play as a character that I don't sympathize with. The ending made the whole game pointless\\, I just wish they gave players the choice on this one. If you like the characters of the first game\\, don't play this one.\r\rStory: 1\/10\r\rGameplay:\rThe gameplay is very similar with the first game which I think one of the weaker parts of the The Last of Us Remastered (2014). Game stages felt repetitive and sometimes empty. The semi open world felt pointless story wise although I think it may add to the overall experience to some. What I like about this game is the comprehensive game difficulty customization which I hope to see more in future games. Overall gameplay felt boring and repetitive\\, and could easily be just a 15 to 20-hour game. It also offers nothing new compared to the first game which I didn't like\\, gameplay wise to begin with.\r\rGameplay: 4\/10\r\rOverall\\, The Last of Us Part 2 failed to lived to its hype. I love how the first game was grounded on realism and has relateable characters and story development\\, Naughty Dog failed to build on these\\, tried to make the Part 2 so different to the point that it is unrecognizable and forced.\r\rOverall: 4.3\/10\u2026 Expand","true":true}
