We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"First thing I'm not a bot\\, I LOVE Naughty Dog\\, and the LOU 1 is my fav game. I stayed away from the spoilers and played for myself. That being said I hate this game! I hated almost all of this game.\r\rEveryone is talking about how bad the story is (it is) but what I'm not hearing is how unnecessarily LONG & repetitive it is. I'm not complaining that it's long I like long games but with this\\, for me there's just no joy after clearing a level feeling like its done then having to do it ALL over again with a different background. It was non stop the same **** over\\, and over\\, and over\\, and over without any payoff. The first game gave us some kind of \\\"hope\\\" at the end of each level or chapter with the second I found myself wanting to quit because I didn't care at all about what was happening and who it was happening to. I hate this game. The only reason I played all the way though was to see how bad the ending would be\\, and it didn't disappoint.\r\rI didn't mind Joel dying\\, in fact I thought that would have to happen\\, I mean why else would Elle want to \\\"kill them all\\\"? They way they killed him makes zero sense\\, the fact the people that did it kept those Ellie & Tommy alive makes no sense. Crazy thing is that I was all fine and dandy to go along with it because I trust the people who made some of my fav games that they'd make this all make sense to me. Spoiler they don't.\r\rIts just awful playing this game when you know about 10 hours into just killing about 5000 one of three different ways that you still have 15-20 more hours of this ****.\r\rThe graphics are amazing! But I don't play games because of great graphics. The Abby and Lev story was the best part of the game for me\\, The sky bridge part was freaking AWESOME  to play in the game. Problem though I **** HATED ABBY! Thats not gonna change and didn't even after seeing her side of things. She kills a man we love with a golf club\\, enjoys killing \\\"scabs\\\"\\, pushes away a man that lovers her only to have sex with him after he's with another women who's present with said guys kid\\, when she's going to kill Dana she finds out she's pregnant and with a knife to her says \\\"good\\\" with almost a smile on her face before Lev stops her. Why should I care about this person. Every time she died when I was playing I enjoyed it\\, I even let Ellie kill her 4 times in the theater.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
