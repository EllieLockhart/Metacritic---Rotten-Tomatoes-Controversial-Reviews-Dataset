Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not perfect by any means.  The whole casino sequence and Princess Mary Poppins in space left a bad taste. Overall I really liked it. It almost felt like the first movie of a new trilogy.  I am looking forward to seeing the new directions the franchise takes.","true":true}
