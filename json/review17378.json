Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw it. First thought was some good\\, lots not so good. After thinking about it\\, there is very little good in this movie. 1\/5. Leia \\\"Mary Poppins\/Starlord\\\" bit was terrible. Lukes story was completely ruined (the biggest waste IMO) and out of character. The whole casino planet was a garbage sidetrack.  Rose\\, the SJW who's \\\"don't destroy what you hate\\, but save what you love\\\" line was so bad. This movie does NOT \\\"honor the saga's rich legacy\\\" at all. It is disrepectful and just plain bad. Ackbars death\\, purple haired general lady\\, fried penguin that Chewbacca couldn't eat\\, lame lame lame \\\"battle of Hoth\\\" recreation\\, the list goes on and on. I never ever comment on the internet\\, but felt compelled to do so for this movie.","true":true}
