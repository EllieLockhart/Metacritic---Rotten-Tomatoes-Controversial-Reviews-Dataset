Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was so original\\, unlike The Force Awakens. The movie showed more aspects of thr force\\, and the way it worked\\, the movie was stellar and well done by Rian Johnson! The future of the Star Wars franchise is now changed\\, because of this movie! If I were you I would go see this movie.","true":true}
