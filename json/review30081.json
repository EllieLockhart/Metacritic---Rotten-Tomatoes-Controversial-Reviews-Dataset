Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sad and disappointed. What a difference between the audience reaction I witnessed for The Force Awakens (ecstatic) and The Last Jedi\\, which was muted other than for cheering at the opening fanfare and at the end for a message about Carrie Fisher. As we walked out\\, I overheard other people speaking in the same bewildered and confused tones that I felt. So much in this film that should have been explored more deeply and with more care\\, is instead treated in a frustratingly shallow\\, unimaginative\\, and trite way.","true":true}
