Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went to theaters to see this and had to stop myself from crying. So many good character arcs for Luke (Such as the Abeloth timeline) were thrown aside to desecrate a strong character that could have been utilized more effectively. A quarter of the movie (the casino scene) could have been cut out and the narrative would have been solid. Watching this felt like a waste of time. A movie that truly used a big draw (Star Wars) for a movie that became a disappointment.","true":true}
