Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don\u2019t let my fellow bitter fan boys bring you down. I\u2019m sorry some of the twists didn\u2019t go the way you were hoping. I personally loved almost every second of this movie. I\u2019m seriously considering making this my favorite Star Wars movie of all time. The acting is much improved over TFA. The storyline and character development was everything I could have hoped for and more. The message of overcoming failure is one that we can all use throughout our lives. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley deliver in the most amazing and epic way possible. Mark Hamill and Andy Serkis knock it out of the park. John Boyega continues his lovable role as Finn and doesn\u2019t miss a step. Carrie Fisher (we miss you) and Oscar Issac (personally\\, I felt they were the weak link in TFA) step it up in a major way and deliver a moving performance that is (dare I use the word) parsecs beyond their previous endeavor. As for the parts that were of the swing-and-a-miss variety see the acting of Kelly Marie Tran\\, Benicio del Toro\\, and Laura Dern (sorry Dr. Sattler). No spoilers in this review\\, but I was a huge fan of all the twists and turns this story took the saga. I\u2019m so glad so many people are in an uproar over Rey\u2019s lineage\\, casually-tossed lightsabers\\, and hidden catch-phrases. It was amazing! Rian Johnson\\, the force is strong with you!","true":true}
