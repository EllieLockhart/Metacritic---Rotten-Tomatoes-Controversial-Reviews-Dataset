Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":". 2 years waiting - for that .....  I was glad to be offered a free full size movie poster\\, but after seeing the movie\\, free is not worth it.  If only someone could have read the script and offered much needed advice - much like like \\\"use the Force\\, Luke\\\" from Obi-wan\\, there would have been some satisfaction.  The 2 remaining forcer-users could barely dispatch a half dozen royal guards.  Pathetic.","true":true}
