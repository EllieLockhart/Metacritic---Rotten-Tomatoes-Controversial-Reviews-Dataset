Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was not the best Star Wars movie\\, but it wasn't the worst. Unlike The Force Awakens this movie was more original and took turns that I didn't expect. Unfortunately\\, some of the things I wanted to see happened didn't. My problem with this movie is the same as the first in that I found myself rooting for Kylo Ren. He is still the most interesting person and I really think in the end he will be the hero. Overall much better than the TFA\\, but it still was a little of a disappointment. And the humor they added into the movie felt really off.","true":true}
