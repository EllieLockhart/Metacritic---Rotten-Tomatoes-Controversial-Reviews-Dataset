Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was all about shock and ore for people watching it for the first time. The moment i found out luke was a hologram\\, i knew the impact of the of the scene with him getting shot at and fighting kylo would loose its impact the next time i saw it (thats if i ever watch it again). The OT had moments that will last for ever (i still get goosebumps watching vader kill palps every time). Luke should have been there in person\\, mabye even use the force to take down a walker or two. That would have made the scene hold more weight \\, and possibly be one of the greatest moments in star wars history. Snoke dieing was lame\\, all that build-up for nothing? I also hate how everytime there is a threat to  the heros\\, it always comes down to the last two seconds before they get out of it\\, makes it so predictable and unrealistic  (i know its a movie but come on!) The Kylo\/Rey dynamic was just creepy and wrong. There was no alien monsters\\, which i think is a part of star wars. I've been a star wars fan for 30 years\\, having spent alot of money on all the new canon books\/comics\/ games ect\\, but i can honestly say i don't think i will waste any more money on the franchise and Star Wars has been ruined for me permanently. Thanks Disney asend Rian\\, way to go!","true":true}
