Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Every opportunity Rian Johnson had to make an interesting story at least comparable to the ones in the extended universe was completely disregarded to make a movie directed at casual fans of star wars and those who arent even fans at all\\, all of the character development in the previous movie was thrown out of the window to create these looney toons disney characters\\, and Ray is also suddenly Saitama from one-punch man\\, but without the minimal training he had (Totally not a Mary Sue).\\nAll in all for any true star wars fan this movie was a gigantic letdown and I personally do not plan on watching any new star wars movie that comes out from the sheer shock of how utterly horrible this one was\\, and at the same time am completely baffled by the critics reviews.","true":true}
