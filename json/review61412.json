Very poor choices by script writers and directors especially that awful slam piece where the two guys ( one of them abby) engaged in sex\\, and Sony wants to censor DMC 5 and FF cause they portray woman as woman\\, shame on you. Playing as the antagonist\\, ND wants to be edgy and blur the lines but we all know Abby is the bad guy. And to go through all of that and then a flashback  stops you from killing her is ridiculous\\,  so you dont even get revenge.. that was such a big point\/theme was revenge and it falls flat. Wont be supporting naughty dog again as they write material worse than fan fiction.  On the black list you go with EA and Bethesda.\r\rIts also funny that most of the 10\/10 user reviewers never rated anything else and echo what the weak critics reviews have said\\, they not handing out free review copys anymore people\u2026 Expand","true":true}
