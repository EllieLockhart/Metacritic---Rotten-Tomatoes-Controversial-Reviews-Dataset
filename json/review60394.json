We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Man\\, what the actual **** I have been sooo mf hyped for this game. Trusted Naughty Dog with my soul. But now I understand how bad of a company and studio they are. Manipulating reviews\\, controlling advertising\\, false advertising in their trailers like we would not notice. They created the masterpiece that we know as the last of us 1. A game where we grew in love with the characters. Learned to appreciate their thoughts and emotions. Once we heard of a sequel everyone including myself became so hyped wanting for more of the characters we loved\\,  a satisfaction to see where the journey of our favorite characters would continue. BUT NO WE WERE ALL WRONG. Naughty dog took this as a step to introduce politics and their stupid agenda they seem to idolize so much. We don\u2019t care if the character is a girl\\, or a lesbian\\, or this or that. As long as it makes sense to the plot and is not trying to shove it down our throats then is fine. This game introduces a diverse cast of characters forcefully. Tries to makes us erase our memories about everything and everyone we loved in the last of us 1. Erase everything completely. As soon as the game starts they kill of one of the characters we love in the most horrendous possible way. And then whole game then process to show events that want to make us hate said character. Oh did I forget to say that they make you play as the character that destroys what we love so much. There aren\u2019t enough words to describe how bad the writing and the plot is. Is just so barebones and in the end remember this words \u201cIT WAS ALL FOR NOTHING\u201d. Graphics are great\\, amazing in fact. And gameplay is fun I guess\\, a little to gory\\, guess naughty dog is a bunch of fckng psychopaths that get hard on this. The shooting just sucks pretty hard. All in all I wouldn\u2019t recommend this game to anyone that loved the foundation of what the last of us 1 was.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
