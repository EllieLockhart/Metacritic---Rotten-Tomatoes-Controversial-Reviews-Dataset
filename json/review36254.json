Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Social Justice Warrior is what this film should have been called. I'll keep it short and try not to rant and rave about everything i disliked about the movie. First of all\\, keep politics out of entertainment\\,  I pay to see a movie to be entertained\\, not be lectured into how I should live my life. Second\\, the scene with leia surviving in the vacuum of space\\, awful. And last\\, WHO THE HELL IS SNOKE? Such a big deal was made of him in the previous movie\\, and now he is dead and we know nothing.","true":true}
