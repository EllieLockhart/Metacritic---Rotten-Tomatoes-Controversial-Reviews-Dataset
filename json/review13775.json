Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I found it to be a big disappointment on all kinds of levels. A movie trying to be a little more weighty just exposed at how shallow the drama really is . They obviously are trying to appeal to a 13 year old age group. Shrugs. I like the actors. I liked the visuals\\, the writing was just garbage. The scene where the escape pods are getting wiped out should feel emotionally horrific but it just felt flat and stupid\\, there is countless examples were it tried to be weighty and all it managed was to expose how shallow the movies have become","true":true}
