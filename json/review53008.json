Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lifelong Star Wars fan\\, I have had high hopes for the new iterations of the films. I saw \\\"A new Hope\\\" in the theater when I was six years old\\, and SW has captured my imagination ever since. I can't even guess how many times I've watched the original trilogy. I eagerly awaited and saw the prequel trilogy. Like most fans\\, I was disappointed in them. I was thrilled to see TFA. I rejoiced at how much I liked Rogue One. I was eager to see TJL and...I HATED it. What a huge let down. Everything that was set up in TFA was just thrown out the window. As a matter of fact\\, everything that was set up since 1977 was thrown out the window. I don't have a problem refreshing ideas and stirring things up\\, but at least have some respect for the original intent of the story. I was angry after seeing this film. This is the first time that I really don't care what happens next. Here's hoping the standalone Han Solo film is good\\, otherwise I'll be content that ROTJ is the finale of the Skywalker saga.","true":true}
