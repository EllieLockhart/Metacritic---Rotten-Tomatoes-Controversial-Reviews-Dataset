Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot and subplots seemed pointless. The story was not in keeping with the original canon.  Just could not connect with it and the character development. In itself it was not actually a bad film\\, but not very good for a star wars film. Too bad considering what was done with Rogue One and The Force Awakens.","true":true}
