Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film walks the line of borrowing from the original saga whilst carving out a story that is completely new. I was blown away by the main storyline of Rey and Kylo Ren\\, and the bold direction Johnson took them in--particularly the villain. My main criticism is that despite being a long film\\, it felt rushed in places. Dialogue in emotional scenes seemed to move too quickly\\, with not enough time between lines to deliver tension. This was probably owing to the fact that the film was so long already and allowing the dialogue to move at a slower (more natural pace) might have added an extra fifteen minutes to the film. Also there is one major cameo that felt a little gimmicky to me and the film could have done without it.","true":true}
