Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Left the cinema feeling like someone had punched me in my gut. Probably one of the worst experiences in my life. My reason for hating it\\, isn't because it's too \\\"bold\\\"\\, \\\"refreshing\\\" or \\\"original\\\"\\, it's because of stupid directorial decisions... The Force Awakens had it's flaws\\, but overall it was a decent Star Wars\\, not the best\\, but definitely not the worst. The last Jedi is the foundation for episode VIII\\, and unless JJ works some absolute magic\\, that's going to suffer as well. Here are my issues with The Last Jedi...\\n\\nTerrible plot\\,\\n\\nPersistent childish humour\\, that ruins also every scene.\\n\\nPoor structure\\, and pacing issues\\,\\n\\nDifficulty maintaining focus\\,\\n\\nFinn and Rose Subplot\\,\\n\\nUnder-utilised characters\\n\\nMissed opportunities - Knights of Ren\\, Snoke.\\n\\nClose call cliches\\,\\n\\nAbysmal character development \\n\\nInconsistencies\\,\\n\\nDaisy Ridleys acting is very flat.\\nAnd that classic Cringe-worthy Disney ending...\\nRian Johnson is not capable of directing Star Wars\\, and beginning to question his ability as a director altogether. The millenniums\\, and the \\\"non-hardcore fans\\\" will tell you that this movie is amazing\\, with the exact same justification from every single one\\, \\\"It's bold\\, and refreshing\\, you h8ters can't be pleased\\\".","true":true}
