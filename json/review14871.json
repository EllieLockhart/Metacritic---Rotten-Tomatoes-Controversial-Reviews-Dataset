Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I honestly don't understand this movies audience score\\, this movie personally blew me away and had a fantastic plot and great character development with older characters and the newcomers. I went to see this movie with a bunch of friends and family and everyone agreed with me that this movie was just awesome! I definitely recommend going to see this! Sure it's very different from any other Star Wars movie in the saga\\, but that's what unique about it\\, it gives Star Wars a fresh look\\, I commend rian Johnson for his work on this movie!","true":true}
