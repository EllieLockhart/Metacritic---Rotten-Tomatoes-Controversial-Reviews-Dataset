Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Interesting addition to the Star Wars movie franchise. A lot more questions than answers but I enjoyed the different twists and different bits of humor mixed in. I\u2019d watch a 2nd time to comprehend everything that happened.","true":true}
