Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved  The force awakens but the last Jedi was much better film With tension pretty much the whole way through the film and often taking an unexpected turn some of which I understand many people don't like. But as a piece of film most of the decisions worked a treat . Mark Hamill was superb with a career best performance and Carrie Fisher  shined in what  would be her final performance. I love this film \\, although I didn't love everything about it.  I say to those who like is less than the preqels\\, seriously! what is the matter with you? I think  and hope that in time it will be recognised as one of the best instalments in the Star Wars saga!","true":true}
