Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Reverting back to the prequels and relying HEAVILY on CGI\\, the film takes a major MAJOR step backwards after JJ's HUGE step forward in the look of the film ( video games) not to mention the story line of Luke\\, it's a very disappointing film after the promise of The Force Awakens   JJ has a VERY BIG task at hand at salvaging this atrocity","true":true}
