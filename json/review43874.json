Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thoroughly enjoyed this great film. Ambitious\\, and takes you out of your comfort zone. Many who thought The Force Awakens was a repeat of Episode IV will have likely predicted this to be a repeat of Episode V. Instead you got something familiar and a lot of new.\\n\\nWell done for all the hard work everyone. Keep it up. \\n\\nOne satisfied fan :)","true":true}
