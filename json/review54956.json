Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It took 40 years\\, but Star Wars is dead...  This is not the franchise George sold.  Episode VII established a lot of interesting stories\/plot lines - Episode VIII killed them all or rather didn't even try to use them\\, lots more detail on youtube.  Mark Hamill was right.","true":true}
