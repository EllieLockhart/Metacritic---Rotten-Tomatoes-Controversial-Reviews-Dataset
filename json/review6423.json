Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney spent 4 billion on this brilliant Skywalker SERIAL\\, only to \\\"reinvent\\\" it as some trite version of The Uncanny X-Men\\, where force sensitive kids across the galaxy spontaneously become Jedi-like. The Force Awakens may have drawn it's story from A New Hope\\, but The Last Jedi drew from several other pieces of less interesting contemporary sci-fantasy fiction instead. That's the BIG irony. Psych! Eventually they will have destroyed all the Star Wars IP. Bet you didn't see that coming. \\n\\nGiven all the mainstream crit (which is mostly poetic fluff)\\, I'd say they've spent a record breaking amount on PR.
