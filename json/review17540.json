Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I signed up just to post this review.\\nWhen movie finished my thoughts were\\, \\\"there has to be more.\\\"  I sat through the credits hoping there was more\\, nope.  When I was driving home I was thinking\\, \\\"did I miss something?\\\" \\nI just watched Star Wars\\, I was supposed to be feeling good\/happy to have watched an epic tale.  Why did it feel like it was shallow\/hollow?  \\nI did not want to believe the review from the fans but after watching\\, I have to agree.  I am definitely disappointed.  Who do I blame?  Directors? Writers? Disney?  \\nIt was a decent movie\\, it was not Star Wars.","true":true}
