Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I started an acct with RT just to post this.  never posted a review before but very upset.  1\/2 star just because it was star wars. Was DISAPPOINTED!!  Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo's speech was so lame and Laura Dern was miscast  Same with DJ\\, horrible; his scenes were the worst.  Reminded me of how I felt with JarJar.  The whole casino sequence was terrible.   Finns character just seemed like he was set on a lame adventure to fill time. Lei flying in space was LAME\/bordered on a Saturday Night Live spoof.  Luke\/Mark Hamill was great as well as Kylo\/Adam Driver.  Rey and Poe were enjoyable to watch as well.  I am a huge STAR WARS fan but I thought the FORCE was not with the movie.  SAD.  RIP Carrie Fisher.I am Asian and ROSE was lame.  Weak character.  the KISS was LAME.","true":true}
