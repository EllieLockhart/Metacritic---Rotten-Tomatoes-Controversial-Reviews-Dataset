Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you know anyting about Star Wars and what made the movies and the story great you will understand why the last jedi is not worth half a star.  It just goes to show how out of touch the creators of this movie are with good story telling.  They seem to care more about their special interests than making a movie with real character and story substance.\\n\\nWhat a disappointment !!!","true":true}
