Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was trash.  Despite the visuals\\, the story made no sense and this movie disrespects the legacy of the SW franchise while also character assasinated the original characters TRUE fans have loved.  l was willing to embrace the new generation of characters but this movie makes those character even more Hollow than the Force Awakens and Rey is a MARY SUE so she is completely LACKS any interest whatsoever  I will forever boycott any movie Rian Johnson has a hand in..","true":true}
