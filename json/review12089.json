Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I almost walked out of this movie.  The plot was poorly executed and at times it seemed like a cheap knock-off\/fan film of a StarWars movie.  I am all for changes and new stories\/directions\\, but had more expectations from Disney since the Marvel Universe is so well executed.  The story here almost felt like it as thrown together in a weekend at a 24hr film festival and edited by a you-tube comedian.   I am really concerned that RJ has been given the next Trilogy\\, based on this movie he doesn't seem like a good storyteller.","true":true}
