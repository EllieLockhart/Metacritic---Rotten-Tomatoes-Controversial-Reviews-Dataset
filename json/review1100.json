Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An unfortunate treatment of the original characters\\, with a complete abandonment of the previous movies course.  As well as a mess Rian Johnson made that the next movie with attempt to recover from clearly altering whatever direction they had planned on originally.  What's worse is the side movies like Solo\\, which was a very enjoyable film with the feel of Star Wars\\, receive poor accreditation and sales performance because of this film further tarnishing the legacy of Star Wars and limiting the boldness in new projects by Disney.","true":true}
