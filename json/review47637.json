Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What was the point of episode 7 if they completely dismantled everything seemingly established? Galaxy felt incredibly small\\, new characters and Finn's ''Love Interest''  was also too on the nose. Hate how they re developed Luke and used him. Very polarizing movie that leaves you feeling pretty empty at the end.","true":true}
