Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This mess of a Star wars movie is a kick in the crunge for all people who love Star wars...Rian Johnson and the producers of this film is the real disaster artists of the year...","true":true}
