{"101487":146759,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-02","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wasn't going to dogpile on this movie because everything negative has already been said. However\\, it really angers me that obviously fake profiles are being used to vote this movie with 5-star ratings. Look at the profiles of the people reviewing with 5 stars. Most (not all\\, as I presume a real person somewhere did think this was a 5-star movie) lead to Page Not Found messages on RT. If you remove all those\\, this movie would be even more of a stinker with fans. \\n\\nWhat I hated the least.\\n\\nThe scene with Laura Dern blowing herself up. Visually very exciting\\, though I felt nothing for the character dying. This could have been a million times better if it was Ackbar. Notice they had Poe incapacitated when he was loaded on the transports. That's because a real man's man like him would have pushed the general onto the ship so he could be the one to die. Even simple male chivalry isn't allowed in this new universe.\\n\\nThe fight in the Red Room. For two minutes I could suspend reality and just enjoy some simple action. Would have been a million times better if this was the final scene of the movie\\, after two hours of learning more about Snoke and how he appeared out of nowhere to put down the rebels after Return of the Jedi where the emperor was killed\\, the second Death Star was blown up\\, and people on all those planets were overturning statues.\\n\\nI enjoyed the space battle at the beginning\\, even though it was done with the sophistication of a child. It's the kind of combat action I expect in Star Wars. Do the bombers have light speed? If so\\, why not appear right over the Dreadnought? If they don't\\, how the hell did they get right up to the target without being spotted and destroyed at a safe distance? They blow up if they get touched! And why is the First Order building all these cool starships with obvious flaws? Why didn't the commander of the Dreadnought jump to light speed when the bombers got close? \\n\\nSpeaking of light speed\\, why could the Millennium Falcon jump to light speed from inside a room in the last movie and not hit anything\\, but in this movie jumping to light speed went into the enemy ships?\\n\\nWhat I hated the most.\\n\\nI admit Luke was never my favorite character\\, but by RTJ (when he matured a bit) I found him tolerable. This movie had me hating him for all the reasons mentioned in other reviews. Killing his nephew? That is so far out of character it made me laugh. Having him drink out of that disgusting land whale was a powerful \\\"WTF were they thinking?\\\" moment\\, too. Can you imagine the discussion? \\\"We need to show Luke submitting body and soul to the idea women are in charge\\, now. How do we do that?\\\" \\\"I know! We'll have him drink alien juice from the spigot!\\\" \\\"Take that men!\\\"\\n\\nI love strong female characters. Alice from Resident Evil is one of my favorites\\, maybe tied with Ripley from Aliens. They have a presence of leadership that isn't tied to their sex. In this movie we are hit over and over with why women are better than men. A woman is the one who dies with quiet dignity on the bombing run\\, saving the hapless Poe from total failure. Laura Dern is put in command of the dying rebel ship and though she does absolutely nothing to convey her strategy to her team until the last ten seconds\\, she once again saves Poe's hapless butt. And with all due respect to the actor who plays Rose\\, but she felt totally tacked on for marketing purposes. It could have been so much better if she happened to be good at programming and she and Finn figure out a way to sneak aboard the enemy ship and do their business. Instead\\, they go to the rich\\, white\\, fat cat casino and tear the place apart like some kind of SJW catharsis scene. And how the hell is she so good at flying rust bucket ships at the end? I hated her character and it only exposed the misandry present throughout this pile of space garbage.\\n\\nHow much cooler would this movie have been if Poe was teamed up with a hot-shot female pilot\\, and together they have to go out and harass the First Order fleet ships to delay them from catching the struggling Rebel ship? That would have given us a great female character\\, one-upmanship (is that a sexist word now?) to see who can do the most damage\\, and make the whole chase scene mean something.\\n\\nIn this movie they can't get women right at all. I don't like Rey--there\\, I said it. I want to like her\\, but the character makes it impossible. I never for one second feel she is in any danger. She always knows what to do\\, or will stumble upon the answer. In a lot of ways she is like the kid who played Anakin in Ep I. Just there for the ride and is a master at everything. Conversely\\, why tease Phasma as this hot-shot confident\\, competent woman commander then have her be the loser in the last movie and another loser in this movie? I presume she'll show up again in a future movie and be equally unimportant. The most \\\"real\\\" woman in the whole movie is Leia\\, but they ruin it with her when she does that THING in space. \\n\\nGosh\\, I guess I hated this movie more than I thought. My 11-year-old son thought the movie was alright\\, but it is telling that even with the crush of marketing on TV\\, he doesn't care about toys\\, comics\\, or anything else related to the franchise. Not like me when I was his age and Empire Strikes Back came out. I wanted it all! So this new movie failed with two key demographics in my household. \\n\\nUnlike those fake 5-star people\\, I'm real.","true":true}
