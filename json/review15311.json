Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I literally made an account because I thought this fan score as it stands at 56% percent right now is so bogus. I'm really in love with this film. It brings lore from the books and extended universe as well as keeping true to its source material and the original trilogy. This movie takes characters and makes them\\, if possible\\, even more complex\\, intruiguing and loveable then they already were. The Last Jedi adds depth to the Star Wars universe in ways the prequels tried and failed to do and ways in which the originals thrived in. This movie fully engrosses you in its story and is absoltuley worthy of the praise and love it SHOULD be getting. I have been a Star Wars fan since I was a child and I'm telling you this film is brilliant and amazing and awesome. It's not perfect but it's pretty damn close.","true":true}
