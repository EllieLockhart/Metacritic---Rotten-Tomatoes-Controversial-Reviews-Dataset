Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite exceptional cinematography and actor performance\\, the incompetently-written story and abysmal character development earn \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" the prize of being the worst Star Wars film to date.  With 2\/3 of this trilogy under the bridge\\, does it have any identity other than fanservice?  Unfortunately\\, the answer is no.  At this point\\, it's rather doubtful that J. J. Abrams can salvage the trilogy with Episode IX.","true":true}
