Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Goes out of its way to ruin the original mythology of the first six films. Star Wars is the story of Skywalker\\, and this one isn't even about a Skywalker. Slapstick humor is out of place\\, writing was lazy at times\\, lots of agendas being forced down the audience's throats... overall\\, a messy and unenjoyable affair. Luke trying to strike down his own nephew in his sleep is completely uncharacteristic from the same hero who wouldn't kill the emperor out of fear or anger. Also\\, the whole plot surrounding a fleet chasing a smaller fleet for 20 hours until the latter runs out of fuel was ridiculous. Save yourself and just see the first six to appreciate the saga. This one was worse that seven.","true":true}
