Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They should've just gathered all of the fan theories and speculations\\, and that would've had a much better plot and consistency. Honestly\\, I wanted to love this movie so much\\, but after seeing it\\, I left feeling so disappointed and kind of hurt. They let all the Star Wars fans down! There were so many ways you could've gone that would've been 100% better than the path you took. Bad storytelling all around.","true":true}
