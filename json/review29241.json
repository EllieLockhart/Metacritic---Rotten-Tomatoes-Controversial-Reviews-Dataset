Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Return of humor\\, romance\\, complexity and ambiguity.  I loved it.  One of my favorites in the franchise\\, since Empire.  Unexpected is good if you're not bogged down in your own ideas.","true":true}
