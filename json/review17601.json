Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Is so hurtfully dissapointed. All the canon we grew with was thrown away to the trash. It is unveliable that a company like Disney who built a shared universe with Marvel couldn't stablish the same line within two star wars movies. There are 3 moments that leaves you with the same martha moment feeling (batman v superman). I sinceraly hope Disney change its mind and not give a new trilogy to this guy.","true":true}
