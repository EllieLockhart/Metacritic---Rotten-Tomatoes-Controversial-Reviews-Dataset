Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie insults the intelligence of Star Wars fans and movie-lovers alike and irreparably defaces the franchise.  Nothing about this movie feels like Star Wars.  The movie is a potpourri of sight gags\\, bad comedy\\, and cheap gimmicks rather than what Star Wars has traditionally been: a sophisticated and well-crafted hero's journey.  Characters act like buffoons\\, and the plot is full of holes and ridiculousness.\\n\\nThis is not just a bad Star Wars movie...It's a bad movie altogether!","true":true}
