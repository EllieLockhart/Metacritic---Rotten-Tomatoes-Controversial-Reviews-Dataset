Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning\\, great special effects and soundtrack. Sadly that's all the good about this movie. For true Star Wars fans\\, this movie was an insult. When Mark Hamill\\, Luke Skywalker himself  says that he fundamentally disagrees with the character design\\, you would expect the director to listen. \\n\\nAfter this movie\\, they have killed off every character of interest\\, Rey is a privileged Mary Sue archetype. Finn went from interesting rogue-stormtrooper\\, to embattled by nonsensical love triangles.Rose's character is so boring you could have replaced her with anyone else\\, or deleted her character entirely and the plot wouldn't change. Poe was a beast pilot\\, agent\\, soldier\\, reduced to a conspiratorial traitor... for what? Because the writers didn't want to reveal to the audience the plan to escape on unshielded transports? In what universe would a commanding officer purposefully mislead and INSULT one of their best assets like that? ANd last but not least we have Leia with the Space Jesus scene out of nowhere\\, saving her life just to write her out of the next film\\, for most unfortunate and untimely reasons. And don't even get me started on how they did Luke so much wrong.\\n\\nIn a franchise that has always managed to display such memorable characters\\, the sudden lack of them post episode 7 can only lead to the death of the franchise. With no good characters\\, there can be no good plot. Will people continue watching them? Yeah\\, probably. But to the tans who have stuck with the franchise and defended it for so many years\\, this movie is truly insulting.","true":true}
