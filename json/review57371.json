Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie really only had women hero\/ protagonist roles in it. All of the men were either pretty dumb or just boring. Rey is quite annoying because she has no weaknesses other than she does know who her parents are\\, shes a Mary Sue. I don't like Rose\\, at all\\, she's a new Jar Jar. I also don't like it how they put jokes a lot into a star wars movie. That just did not please me. You don't feel like your watching a Star Wars movie at times\\, like on planet that Finn and Rose visit when they try and find the master hacker. And the only characters I liked in this movie was Chewbacca\\, Kylo Ren\\, and the master hacker. I don't like Luke in this movie because he is very boring and he isn't a good teacher. And I hate how he died. This is one of my least favorite star wars films ever. They could have made greatness but they blew it up like the death star.","true":true}
