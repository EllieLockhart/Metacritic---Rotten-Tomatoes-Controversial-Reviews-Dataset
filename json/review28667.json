Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pure and utter garbage\\, I never would have imagined anything could be worse than The Clone Wars or The Force Awakens. This didn't adhere to a single bit of established mythos and is a complete butchering of Luke Skywalker.","true":true}
