Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First off I never write movie reviews.  I'm in my 50's and this movie has made me so angry that I felt it necessary to voice my opinion.  I can't believe the critics consensus is so high for a movie that was crap.  I'm a long time Star Wars fan.  I saw the first one when I was 12.  Now 40 years later I think I've seen my last one after viewing this travesty called the Last Jedi.  Whoever wrote this garbage should be ashamed of themselves.  Plot holes you could drive a truck through\\, absurd subplots\\, lack of character development and for some character's they didn't act like their characters.  Furthermore\\, hero's are suppose to die heroically or mythically but the Last Jedi writers don't seem to grasp that idea.  I could write a book about all the reasons I didn't like this installment of the Star Wars franchise.  So\\, in short\\, lets just say I sat through an overly long movie and left very dissatisfied\\, unhappy and disappointed.  Fantastic visuals but very poor writing and plot.  Disney should reconsider Rian Johnson for writing or directing any further installments regardless of all the praise given by the top critics.  Listen to the fans and avoid this movie.","true":true}
