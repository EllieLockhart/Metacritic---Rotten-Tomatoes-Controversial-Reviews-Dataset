The worst game that naughty dog has ever published. Its predictable and disappointing . Its completely recognizable that they didnt have enough story so they would do the same thing over and over again and do a lot of throw backs and character changing. the high meta scoreI give you an advice. if you liked the first game dont even consider playing this.actually dont play it either way .
