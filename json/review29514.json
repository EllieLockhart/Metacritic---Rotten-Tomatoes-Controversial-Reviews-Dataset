Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson just destroyed Star Wars... and Disney is going to reward him with a trilogy. Kathleen Kennedy is not fit to run this saga. I'm appalled with this horrible movie. Congratulations on killing Star Wars for all the diehard fans. I've been a fan since I was 8 years old and saw the original in the cinema. I loved 'TFA' and rogue one\\, and was so excited to see TLJ\\, But now I'm beyond disheartened. I'm heartbroken. The franchise was just destroyed!","true":true}
