Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"IT'S VERY BEAUTIFUL BUT..\\nA complete 1080o that could have been good\\, if it was well made. There is just too much plot holes\\, bad jokes\\, incoherencies with the main saga and plots that leads to nothing. The WORST starwars they even created the most hated caracter ever in a star wars.. good job Ryan Jonhson\\n\\n \\n\\nJAR JAR > ROSE","true":true}
