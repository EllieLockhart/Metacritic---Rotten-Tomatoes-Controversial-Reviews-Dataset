Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A lot of the value of a movie franchise is in its continuity. Regretfully the Last Jedi has fails to maintain continuity with the Star Wars Universe\\, with in the trilogy to which it belongs\\, but most importantly within the movie itself. The premises for the story and the plot devices are simply not believable and poorly thought out. There are entire sequences which could easily be edited out with no loss to the story. The characters are not very engaging and it is hard to see how they are going to evolve. The protagonist herself has no more growing or development to do. The villains have no real presence. Admittedly the movie is in a fantasy setting\\, but some realism and consistency in the physics of the movie does help in the immersion of the audience. Perhaps the director should have consulted with his local high school physics teacher early on in the production.","true":true}
