Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoiler alert\u2014 I have to admit I left the movie scratching my head wondering what my true feelings were about this movie. I consider myself a passionate Star Wars fan. Yes\\, I won\u2019t deny I had certain expectations for how I wanted things to go in this movie. Who Rey is\\, Luke\u2019s power of the force\\, etc... But the more I think about how things did not go the way I wanted the more I appreciate it. If you want the same thread to just keep repeating over and over again with new characters in new outfits then you are not going to like this installment. If you instead want the force and it\u2019s intentions to evolve then you will understand why they did what they did. It may not be popular to many hardcore fans but if you look at it from a different viewpoint you will get it.","true":true}
