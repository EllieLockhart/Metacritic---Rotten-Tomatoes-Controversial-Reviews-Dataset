Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Garbled mess. Filled with plot-holes\\, side-quests that lead to nothing\\, characters that don't progress\\, and the terrible handling of old characters. \\nAt this point\\, I'm glad all the old characters are dead\\, as now we won't get disappointed by how tasteless they get treated in this trilogy. \\nThe Luke ending was terrible\\, it started out hopeful but then transitioned into something that seriously couldn't have been approved by proper screenwriters. \\nAll characters seem to be caricatures that stick within their description providing no interesting value beyond a brief moment between Rey and Kylo Renn (who is arguably the only character that has some kind of interesting depth to him). \\nI know the excuse often is that it's a kids movie\\, but that's nonsense given the intricate plot-themes it tries to push\\, and the tie-ins with old movie themes\\, plots and characters. \\nAll in all\\, a mess with no thread other than 'burn the past'\\, sorry but I think until this stuff gets any better\\, I'd rather 'burn the present' ;)\\nBetter luck next time!","true":true}
