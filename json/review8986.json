Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From the genius who directed Brick and Looper. Rian Johnson + Star Wars = an absolutely incredible Star Wars movie. I love everything about this movie. The storytelling is amazing. The characters are amazing. This movie has tons of emotion in it. The visuals are awesome. The action scenes are fantastic. I absolutely love how they handle Luke Skywalker. This movie is more than a Star Wars movie. It is an inspiring movie with amazing themes and messages. As a Star Wars fan\\, I absolutely adore this movie. This is the Star Wars film I always wanted. This is easily the best Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back. I am not only excited for Episode IX but I am also excited for more works from Rian Johnson. Thank you Rian Johnson for making such an emotional and inspiring movie. Grade: A+","true":true}
