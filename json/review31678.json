Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sorry. but TLJ just failed epic. The whole base story can be told in five words: Running away in slow motion.\\nThat's too less for 2 1\/2 hours. \\nMany parts were executed very poorly story wise. \\nThe potential of many characters was wasted that way and\/or the way how they were portrayed was very disappointing.\\nHowever\\, there are indeed some interesting twists.","true":true}
