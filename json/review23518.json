Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved this Episode. Definitely one of my favorites. I've watched it 3 times within the first 24 hours and can't wait to see it again. It is witty and dramatic with plenty of twists\\, turns\\, and surprises. I suspect the fans who did not like it either expected the story line to go a certain way and were upset that they were wrong. Or they are \\\"Originalists\\\" and nothing will life up to the original trilogy. I was 6 when I say A New Hope\\, and nothing will ever replace the thrill or experience of those movies for me; however\\, I still appreciated the prequels for what they were and love.the new trilogy because it is meant to be....a new era for a new generation.","true":true}
