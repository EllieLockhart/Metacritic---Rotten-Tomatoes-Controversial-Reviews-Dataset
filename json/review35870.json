Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is the best Star Wars movie released in years.  It subvert expectations and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  With great performances across the board\\, the characters\\, especially Rey and Ben\\, are deeper than they've ever been.  It breaks away from the surface and gives us more Star Wars Lore than we've gotten from the movies in years.  Some follies were humor breaking the tone\\, but every joke was a hit\\, no matter how seemingly out of place.  Overall\\, a must see.","true":true}
