Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My first watch had me rolling my eyes constantly with all the cheesiness through the first 3\/4 of the movie. The last 1\/4 I really enjoyed first watch. Then I enjoyed my second watch much\\, much more. Overall as a story\\, it\u2019s pretty good. Despite what I see some saying about it being inconsistent to the characters of previous Star Wars movies\\, I disagree. It\u2019s consistent and makes sense for the most part. A few things I can\u2019t get over with how much they don\u2019t make sense to me\\, but overall it\u2019s a great movie. ","true":true}
