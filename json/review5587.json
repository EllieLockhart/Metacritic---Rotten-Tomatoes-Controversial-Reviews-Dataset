Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Did not like it at all. Too many holes in the plot\\, characters act like idiots\\, the villain doesn't have a charisma whatsoever. I loved the original movies\\, I liked the next three. But now the franchise is going down in flames. Won't even waste my time watching the next movie.","true":true}
