Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Anyone complaining about this film is doing it for entirely selfish bullshyt reasons\\, or its just the alt-right bots lowering the score because too many women were given rolls in the new Star Wars. Story telling\\, character building\\, this new and old\\, this Star Wars really has it all\\, and if you're b*tching\\, its for the wrong reasons\\, not that because the film lacked merit.","true":true}
