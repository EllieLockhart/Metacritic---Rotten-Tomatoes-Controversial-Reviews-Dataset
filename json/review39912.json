Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is by far the worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen.  I can't believe the all the plot holes in the movie\\,....  What they did with Luke Skywalker's character was a shame...  It is so unfortunate because you can't undo what Rian Johnson did....  He should never be allowed to work on another Star Wars movie ever again.","true":true}
