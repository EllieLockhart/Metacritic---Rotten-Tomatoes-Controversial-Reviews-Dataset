Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By far the worst addition to the Star Wars universe ever\\, including the old EU\\, the prequels\\, the holiday special -- everything. Someone else on here said it well: \\\"Decent movie\\, terrible Star Wars movie.\\\" Casual viewers may enjoy it\\, but anyone actually invested in the Star Wars universe will hate it. Not only is it bad on its own\\, but it ruins old characters and developments. It's like Rian Johnson never even watched The Force Awakens\\, never mind anything that came before it.","true":true}
