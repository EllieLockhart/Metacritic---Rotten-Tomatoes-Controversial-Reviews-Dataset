Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just adding this review just so that I could vent. SW TLJ took away whatever I liked about the original star wars\\, what we grew up with and discarded it for commercial reasons and to pay lip service to progressivism. So we have a violet haired admiral pull off an audacious last stand\\, whereas of course the pilot in charge of all the flying so far\\, is a hokey over emotional twit. But worst of all\\, the treatment given to Mark Hamill's character\\, as if he is an overgrown Man child who defiantly gets some milk from an alien making faces at the true hero(ine) and then has a battery drain while engaged in some pointless fight with the true villains. Seriously\\, Disney could have just shown him to have been gone a long while back rather than bringing his character back into such disrepute and pointless humiliation. SW TLJ is by the numbers meant for creating a soul less franchise. Pathetic.","true":true}
