Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\u2014\u2014\u2014- The Star Wars movie that ruined everything. Visually stunning but absolutely No story. The bad guys chase the good guys but you never really care because the characters are so poorly developed. And guess what Princess Leia can do? She can fly people. Yep\\, she can fly like superman and it doesnt stop there. Luke Skywalker is such a pussy that he only fights by somehow projecting his image across the galaxy while he does a yoga pose on his deserted island. Cant believe this script got approved. Horrible\\, horrible\\, horrible.","true":true}
