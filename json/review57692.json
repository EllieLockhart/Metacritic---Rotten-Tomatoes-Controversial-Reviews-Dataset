Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Underwhelming. It felt like a repeat of the same story: a hotheaded apprentice with conflicting loyalty and family issues tries to take over\/save the galaxy while other hotheads blow stuff up.  Each scene felt like a fresh\\, hastily-devised threat which is promptly overcome or avoided before the next meaningless peril arrives for another predictable resolution. Some scenes - like that of Laura Dern's Holdo watching the escape pods being destroyed one-by-one - seemed to be put on pause whilst we returned to other scenes making her character seem tactically dim-witted. Indeed the rate at which the pods were being blown up with the number of pods available made it confusing how any survived given the length of time of the intervening scenes.  There's comedy - some good (Chewie's lunch being interrupted) some cheap and cringey (Kylo Ren shirtless\\, Captain \\\"Salty\\\").   The acting feels hammed up but that might not stand out so much if you saw the saga films back-to-back.   There are good moments and it is generally entertaining but I left the IMAX feeling like I should have waited for it to come out on Netflix.","true":true}
