Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a slap in the face in a lot of ways to those who have grown up with the series. You could really feel Disney\u2019s influence in this. Though easy to watch cinematically; Risks were taken creatively that shouldn\u2019t have been taken. I felt easily taken out of scenes and moments in the film by the comedic aspects that all too often effected the seriousness of the film. Over all there were too many elements that clashed in the film\\, too many events that lead to unanswered questions\\, and too many moments that left me feeling dumbfounded. Ultimately I was left with an empty feeling at the end of this one. ","true":true}
