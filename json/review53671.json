Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For one hundred and fifty minutes\\, The Last Jedi latches on via force choke and never lets go. Rian Johnson fashioned a bold and invigorating journey that explores new ideas that lead to unforgettable moments. Moments that the film leans on are mixed with mystery and a dash of nostalgia that didn't give me what I wanted but gave me things I didn't know I wanted in return.","true":true}
