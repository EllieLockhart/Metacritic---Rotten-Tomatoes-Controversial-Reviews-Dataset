Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie left me distraught. Every expectation that was set up both in The Force Awakens and within this movie itself was subverted. As the starwars nerd in the group everyone was asking me confused questions at the end. I really wanted to like this movie but by the end I didn't know what or if I should care anymore as everything seemed to just want to subvert my expectations. You can only do that so often before as an audience member I stop caring and this movie did it way too much.","true":true}
