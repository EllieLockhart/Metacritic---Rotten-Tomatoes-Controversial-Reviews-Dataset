Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie destroyed my enthusiasm that I had about seeing future Star Wars movies. The direction they took the characters was extremely disappointing. What a waste for Luke Skywalker. I have no reason to continue following this story that I was enamored with as an adult and adolescent.","true":true}
