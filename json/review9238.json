Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Garbage. It makes me sad; such a great story was ruined by Disney. So many pointless characters and over acting. Horrible timing and badly placed jokes. I\u2019m going to watch the original three movies and pretend like The Last Jedi never was made. ","true":true}
