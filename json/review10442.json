Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great original story\\, like where they are headed. See so many dogging the film cause it wasnt something they wanted for the story instead of actually having an open mind and lowering their adult filters on it. Can't wait to see it again.","true":true}
