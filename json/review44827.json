Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Truly epic! The story is amazing\\, the action is spectacular and the acting is sublime. The direction that Rian Johnson took in making this film is tombe commended\\, it's good the first time but it warrants at least two viewings to truly grasp everything that happens and you see the full scope of how brilliant a film it is. On par with Empire as the greatest Star Wars film ever made.","true":true}
