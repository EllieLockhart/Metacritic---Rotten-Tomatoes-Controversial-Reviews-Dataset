{"101487":147633,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-02-24","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would give this zero stars if I could. What a ridiculous movie. Due to the thousands of well written comments on here already (and the hundreds of YouTube videos discussing this very topic)\\, it's apparent to see that this movie was nothing more than a grimy fart-smelling pile of crap served to use by Rian and Kathleen in the Disney suite. What a disgrace to the franchise and our beloved Star Wars characters as a whole. Anyone above the age of 5 will notice the horrible abundance of plot holes in this film. How do they get paid millions of dollars to make this crap? Who approved of this story? Also\\, this revealed absolutely zero answers to its predecessor\\, The Force Awakens\\, like: who are the Knights of Ren\\, who is Lor San Tekka and why did Luke entrust him with the map\\, if Leia trusted Poe so much to send him on that mission\\, why wasn't he chosen as captain in TLJ\\, who is Rey\\, why is she on Jakku\\, who are her parents\\, who is Snoke\\, how and why is he more powerful than the Emperor\\, what was he doing during the time of the Empire\\, how did Plutt get the Millenium Falcon\\, how did Maz get Luke's lightsaber\\, and the list goes on. We have no idea what happened or why\\, other than Luke tried to kill Kylo in his sleep (something completely out of his character). But we don't even see Snoke convince Kylo to join the dark side. And then to add to the inconsistencies\\, like Finn being completely healthy after only 1 day of being sliced down the spine from Kylo\\, Rey and Kylo get zero training after it was apparent that they both needed it by the end of the TFA\\, if Luke did want to be found then why did he make a map in the first place\\, and there are many more issues. This isn't even including the SJW shit and the pointless anti-capitalism scene on Kanto Bite with Finn and Fat Asian Bitch. You know Disney\\, you wouldn't even be close to where you are now without capitalism\\, you realize that\\, don't you? How is Kennedy not fired yet!? This movie\\, to me\\, and even The Force Awakens now\\, are nothing more than \\\"Disney Fan Films.\\\" I'm going back to consider the EU\\, Kotor\\, and older\\, better materials to be canon. Not this Disney garbage!","true":true}
