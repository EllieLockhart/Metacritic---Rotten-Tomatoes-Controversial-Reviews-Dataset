Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They had unlimited resources to make this film. Even so\\, jokes fall flat\\, there is a completely meaningless story arc\\, Luke's character is horribly misrepresented\\, and overall it's nothing but a meagre product to extend the star wars franchise.","true":true}
