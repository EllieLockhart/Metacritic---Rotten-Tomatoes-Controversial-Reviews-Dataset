Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very good. one of my top 3 or 4 star wars movies. So far a feel a lot of the bad things I heard were people that went in with too many specific expectations.","true":true}
