Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not a Star Wars movie. It's a Disney movie\\, princess and all\\, with a Star Wars skin slapped on. Disney really dropped the ball when it comes to the long time fans\\, and extended universe fans. For their sake\\, they better hope it takes off with this younger generation. I can now say that Star Wars has lost its appeal for me\\, never would of thought I'd go from waiting forever in lines for opening night tickets\\, to not caring what happens with the material now. It's a shame really.","true":true}
