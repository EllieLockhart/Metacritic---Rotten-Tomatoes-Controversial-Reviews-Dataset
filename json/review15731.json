Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie\\, no idea why there are people who are hating on it.\\n\\nPeople complained that \\\"Force Awakens\\\" was too much like a \\\"New Hope\\\" Now this movie is completely different from any thing we've seen before and they STILL complain.","true":true}
