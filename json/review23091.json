Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it! As a super-fan of the series\\, I love where the story is going. It makes old characters seem more human\\, breaks new boundaries in regards to potential\\, and shatters former definitions and barriers of what the Force is and how it holds the Universe together. The references to Eastern philosophy are refreshing and the parallels that are drawn to the originals will have you watching this one over and over! May go see it a 5th time. In my opinion one of the most visually stunning films I\u2019ve ever seen. ","true":true}
