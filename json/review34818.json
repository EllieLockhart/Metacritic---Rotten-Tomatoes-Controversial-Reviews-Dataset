Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The effects are great\\, the actors are good\\, the Luke+Rey scenes were wonderfully engrossing\\, the writing...was not. I enjoyed myself while I was in the theater watching it but as soon as I walked out and my brain engaged most of that enjoyment melted away like ice on a summer sidewalk. Everything I enjoyed was a sudden twist or unexpected event that makes no sense when I think about it. No re-watch appeal.","true":true}
