Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie wasn't what I was expecting\\, and that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Yes\\, the whole Finn\/Rose subplot felt flat and unnecessary\\, but I enjoyed virtually everything else about this film.  The connection between Rey and Kylo Ren really intrigued me\\, the fight with Snoke's red guards was a thrill to watch\\, and while the interaction between Luke and Rey didn't have the epic fairy tale tone of past Star Wars films\\, it actually felt more real to me.  It wasn't just another Wise Mentor teaching an Idealistic Apprentice--it felt like normal people trying to cope with all the wonderful\\, horrible madness they've been through\\, and to measure up to people's expectations they aren't sure they can meet.  I suppose it's kind of like producing a Star Wars film--expectations are through the roof\\, and you can't satisfy everyone\\, so you just do the best you can.  I think Rian Johnson did a solid job\\, and I'll be back for Episode 9.","true":true}
