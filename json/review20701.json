{"101487":146167,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-25","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I waited to see this film.  I had planned to go opening day\\, but that didn't work out\\, so I waited.  I knew friends would see the movie and I'd have a good idea if i should ready myself for disappointment or be excited.  It was mistake.  I should have ignored all things Star Wars until after I saw the movie.\\n\\nI will start by saying\\, like many others have\\, that this was not the movie I was hoping for.  I will also say I understand why so many have\\, for lack of a better word\\, trashed the movie.  I think the missed the point.\\n\\nThere are flaws.  There were in Force Awakens\\, but I still enjoyed it much more than I did The Last Jedi.  I don't want to include specifics to avoid spoilers\\, but there were a few moments that were more Deus Ex Machina\\, than the shock of \\\"No. I am your father\\\". I know they were meant to be shocking or surprising plot twists\\, but I think Rian Johnson should not write any more Star Wars movies... stick to directing\\, because the movie was well directed.\\n\\nThere were some great moments.  There were some so-so moments.  I think the final showdown was slap in the face to fans.  I still wouldn't stinker the whole movie over it. It is a good movie\\, if you don't watch it comparing it to your vision of what it should have been and stop pretending to know what George Lucas's vision was... watch the prequel trilogy.  He made the stuff up as he went along.   Also... don't hate it because of Disney.  They make good movies more often than crap ones.\\n\\nIf you're on the fence\\, go see it.  It's enjoyable.  I didn't feel like leaving even one time.  You'll have some groan moments\\, but if you just try to enjoy the characters and their stories... you'll like the movie.","true":true}
