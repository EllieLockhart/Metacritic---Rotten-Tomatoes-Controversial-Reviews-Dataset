{"101487":105043,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a generic action movie\\, this one succeeds.  It's fun to watch the well-timed fight sequences.  Even if the overall plot is ridiculous\\, you can be periodically immersed in the masterful choreography of the battle scenes. But...\\nI have always wanted Star Wars to mean something\\, or to stand for something.  To me\\, it stood for team\\, faith\\, and hope against impossible odds.  It wasn't an action movie\\, it was inspirational. I keep coming back the Star Wars reference in Reign of Fire - not a great movie\\, but in it the protagonists face similar overwhelming forces.  As a fable to lighten the spirits of their children\\, they re-tell Star Wars around the camp fire.  That little scene echoes Star Wars' place in our popular zeitgeist. \\nSo I wanted Star Wars to take itself somewhat seriously - to recognize that it is a legitimate\\, meaningful touchstone for a generation; a fable for our time.  That can still be done with humor - even goofy humor as the original movies demonstrate (nurf-herder?) and still be true to the underlying gravity of the fable.\\nThe original film did this by making the humor relevant to the story; \\\"nurf-herder\\\" was the best a frustrated and falling-in-love Leah could come up with in the moment.  The goofy line was testament to the complicated internal need to show toughness\\, but not having truly negative feelings toward Han. \\nIt doesn't matter that the original films managed this balanced tone deliberately or through change.  That was the ultimate result. Despite comic relief from C3PO\\, Han\\, etc.\\, the films still had earnestness.\\nIn order to be regarded as earnest\\, the audience can't be feeling like they are getting a wink and nod from the film. The humor\\, goofy as it may be\\, needs to be relevant to the plot. And finally\\, it has to be easy to suspend your disbelief.\\nA director's part should never be apparent on screen.  The cameos\\, Easter eggs\\, and pet plot lines make it feel that Johnson is constantly tugging on your sleeve for attention.  The dice\\, for instance\\, meant nothing to the majority of fans\\, I'd bet\\, but featured heavily in TLJ.  Side plots that seemed to be simply loop trails must have been left in because they were considered too expensive to cut\\, or were someone's pet fantasy about some personally-imagined part of the galaxy.\\nAll action and drama films need some relief or dissonant resolution for audiences to relax enough to process the next scene. But the humor in TLJ is largely throw away\\, misplaced\\, or vulgar.  Milking the alien was akin to toilet humor.  Perhaps it was meant to showcase Skywalker's new nihilistic attitude toward life\\, but it feels forced and less funny than simply gross. And TLJ is the first episode where we see someone half naked.  Ren is shirtless in the middle of a dramatic sequence\\, and Rey asks him to put a shift on.  The joke is flat\\, easily missed\\, and the whole scenario doesn't seem to tell us much.  Is there supposed to be sexual tension? (There wasn't.) Thankfully\\, I don't remember any character saying \\\"I have a bad feeling about this..\\\" or \\\"What the!?\\\"\\nLastly\\, for the two plus hours they are sitting in the theater\\, a fan wants to forget they are sitting in the theater. Mom jokes\\, talk about God\\, and the seeming inconsistency in the rules of the setting make painful reminders that none of this is real\\, there is no magic - it's just another director trying to show off how clever they are.  Remember when Luke was frozen in the cave ceiling on Hoth and was struggling to reach his lightsaber?  The force seemed to be foreign to him\\, like he was still trying to understand what it was and so were we!  It made sense. But a child uses the force to smoothly pick up a broom when it would have been easily grabbed\\, and the apparently untrained orphan Rey still seems to have no way to account for her prodigious abilities despite being a match for the highly trained and powerful master\\, Kylo Ren.  This discontinuity jars the viewer out of their reverie and reminds them that yes\\, this is just another money engine. Art\\, story\\, and magic have been traded\\, as they always will be\\, for profit. The power and mystery of the force-infused galaxy is reduced to cheap tricks and they throw-away demi-gods normally reserved for comic books.\\nSo Star Wars as a cultural touchstone appears to be gone; no one will be quoting this movie around a campfire.  Long term memory needs emotion to stick\\, and emotion is something this movie can't provide.","true":true}
