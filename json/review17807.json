Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It felt like watching an Avengers movie with the Star Wars characters plugged in.  It was clearly the red-headed stepchild of the saga. The cast was amazing but unfortunately the same cannot be said about the writer.  The two stars are just for the suffering the actors had to endure when carrying out their character's assassinations.","true":true}
