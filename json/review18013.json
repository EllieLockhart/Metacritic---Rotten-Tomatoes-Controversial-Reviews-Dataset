Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think the last Jedi overall was an amazing movie. It gave us a great thought provoking moments about how the force really isn't the force we all knew. It delved deeper into what used to be called grey jedis\\, ones who walk the border of the dark and light sides. And it really shows how much the force has to be balanced\\, if one side is unbalanced then the force will balance itself out. There were shockingly powerful moments. This movie has hints and references to all the other movies in the franchise while still putting a fresh spin on this great 40 year old franchise. While TFA gave us powerful moments\\, this movie felt powerful over all and helped us get a better understanding of the universe of Star Wars.","true":true}
