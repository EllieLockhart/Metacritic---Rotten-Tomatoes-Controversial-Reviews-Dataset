{"101487":196138,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When I watched TFA I liked it at first\\, but the more I watched it the less I liked it. However\\, when I saw TLJ I was completely and utterly dissapointed\\, confused\\, and sad. \\n\\nFirst Act: The first scenes were amazing it had great action\\, dialogue\\, and it felt like I was watching an actual Star Wars movie. It wasn't flawless\\, but still did what it intended to very well... THIS WAS ALL THROWN OUT OF THE WINDOW WITH SOME OF THE DUMBEST STORYTELLING THAT DOESN'T EVEN MATCH UP WITH THE PREQUELS! First\\, of all how the f**k did Leia survive in the vacuum of space!? She closes her eyes like she's accepting her fate or something and then she flys out of the ship. She would have been a good 20 yds. or more from the Resistance ship\\, then after a few seconds of being (she's dead or something) in space she OPENS her EYES and flys back to the ship. WTF! If she was using the force to propel herself back i'd understand\\, but she somehow able to generate a force shield or something (not sure if she did) and go on as if it's nothing. When she goes back to the ship she loses consciousness\\, so she wasn't consciouswhen she was in space. This was a very obvious error in my opinion\\, plus where did she learn that technique from\\, this dumb scene could've been fixed by not including it at all. Next\\, the First Order's \\\"capital ship\\\" can't keep up with the Resistance ship\\, so you're telling me that the First Order's ship can't jump into lightspeed or speed up a little bit to catch up. Also this goes on for 95% of the movie. Also it's super-mega\\, destructo cannons can't break through some ships' shields that aren't even a THIRD the size of it. After this stupidity we witness arrive at the MOST SADDENING PART OF THIS MOVIE!!!!! Luke's character completely flops and turns into this old angry dude that throws his dad's lightsaber off a cliff (he also tried to murder his nephew). \\n\\nAct 2: Not going to mention this\\, but it's just filler with Finn and this irrelevant character named... \\\"ROSE\\\" (Wow\\, Such a creative name). Anyways\\, they go to a casino on this planet that looks anything like Star Wars. They find this guy that can hack into the tracking device on the Resistance ship and remove it. Forgot to mention the FO can track ships through lightspeed. So this part of the movie is completely pointless. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI'm not going to mention the rest of the pointless filler.\\n\\nFINAL ACT: I'll cut this short *deep breath*: ReygoestotheFOflagshipgetscapturedbyKyloRen","true":true}
