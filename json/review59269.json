Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"SPOILER: Please do not read this review if you haven't finished this game. This game has the worst ending and the most annoying character called Dina which happened to be a pretty important character in the game. I think many of us played this game for hours with the mindset based on the pre release trailer or encounter between Abby and Joel. I couldn't believe how horribly Naughty Dog ended the game. It was just very disappointing to invest so many hours in this game. What was the purpose of this game? Ellie didn't do anything to respond appropriately to the brutality showed by Abby. Ellie instead kept taking beating by Abby. This game has the weakest main character. I think Abby's character was much stronger and meaningful than Ellie's character. Such a disappointment. I have never given 1 star to any games before\\, but after finishing Ghost of Tsushima I am happy with 1 star rating for this game. I hope Naughty Dog would learn something from Sucker Punch. Last of Us II is the ONLY game that I have ever pre-ordered. One thing is for sure\\, I will never pre-order any Naughty Dog's game. It's a lesson learned. Given such a terrible Metacritic User Score for this game\\, I would say majority of the people are disappointed with Naughty Dog. I hope in the future people wait to buy games by Naughty Dog until enough user reviews are in and then buy if the reviews are good. I am NOT going to spend my money on some crappy games by Naughty Dog.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
