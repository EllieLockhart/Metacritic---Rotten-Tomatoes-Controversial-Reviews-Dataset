The backlash from the old gamergate crowd has largely been the same as it was to the games that came out around the time I was falling for their tactics\\, forced diversity and all that.\r\rI'm not going to sit around and say it's a perfect game\\, I think some characters lack the chemistry that Ellie and Joel had in the first game\\, but the characters progressed in a way that was not unearned. Ellie finding out what Joel did at the hospital driving them apart\\, as well as the guilt of not knowing.\r\rThe gameplay was not entirely different from the first game\\, but there were some aspects it improved upon. I personally feel like the weight of the weapons you are using really shines through in this game\\, even if some times it can seem a bit unrealistically gory for extra cool points. The puzzles\\, however\\, were a pretty big let down. There were a few great ones scattered around\\, but I recall one specific instance where I found a safe and was preparing to look for clues on the combination. When I began to walk around the room I almost immediately stopped\\, seeing the whiteboard that contained the code for the safe not 5 feet away from it in giant letters.\r\rThe plot\\, the area most people are bombarding with negative reviews\\, is not lacking in most regards. The previously mentioned lack of chemistry can mostly be chalked up to the phenomenal writing of the first game and how this story just fell short in some aspects\\, but comparing it to the old masterpiece makes it look far worse than it actually is\\, the characters are still likable and don't really force and political agenda (unless you consider the existence of other races and sexualities political).\r\rAll in all\\, give the game a try\\, especially if you like the first game\\, it builds on the old story and gives perspectives that we weren't privy to before. It shows the reality of living in a more brutal world and the consequences of the first game really play out in this one. Don't be fooled by a bunch of people who never even played the game (since most of the negative reviews came out within hours of the game's release) I think you'll enjoy it if you don't actively try to look for reasons it would offend you.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
