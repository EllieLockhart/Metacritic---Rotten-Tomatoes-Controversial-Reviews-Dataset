Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It felt like Rian and Disney hated Star Wars and did everything they could to make this movie erase so much of what made the previous lore and story great. Rey is overpowered\\, there is no denying that. Kylo is the most complex character in this new trilogy\\, and that only counts when he's not throwing a tantrum. It was a huge waste to kill off Snoke without having any knowledge of what his purpose was in this new series. And what a waste of Luke's character making him do nothing meaningful or interesting besides being beat by a girl because all men are stupid or something. Finn has so much wasted potential as well. Basically\\, if you love the prequels as I do\\, and the original trilogy\\, this movie is a huge letdown. Don't waste your money. Some people should not make movies\\, and Rian is one of them.","true":true}
