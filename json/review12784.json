Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'D give it 0 star rating if this allowed me. This movie made me not care about the continuation of the saga. i know they will pull SOMETHING out  of their asses to try to fix this debacle\\, but i don't care about the rest of the story. the movie felt like an intellectual property rather than an actual star wars movie\\, all that was shown during the trailer was just expectation fuel\\,  cus THAT's all this movie had.","true":true}
