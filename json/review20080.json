Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was mediocre\\, derivative\\, and flaccid. Lame plot-devices\\, lame dialogue\\, I could go on and on. Blows my mind that it's been hyped as even approaching the quality of Empire. That's laughable.","true":true}
