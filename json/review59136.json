Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"this game has so many basics flaws that Im sick of it since minute 1\\, from the way joel dies cuz he seem unaware that he lives literaly in the end of the world and follows a random dude to a place where has ppl with weapons close to his town like\\, what the actual **** joel has been surviving for more than 20 years in this **** he is not stupid or easy to trick\\, he knows all the trick\\, he has done it him self\\, the problem here is\\, he sees a bunch of ppl and doesnt think about taking his revolver and aim at the head of that **** he just follows her like\\, nah this is safe\\, is like the meme with the guy on a house on fire saying this is fine.\ralso the story is BULL**** is not deep is not amazing is not revealing it doesnt teach e moral\\, it does nothing but ****ing hit u in the face one time after another\\, they straight up LIED to us with the trailers they lied and lied and lied cuz they knew what they were doing would be bought by any fan cuz is trash\\, we have to go with a hatefull character half of the game and in every single moment we see how is EVIL is not a bad person\\, is not a damaged person\\, is a really evil person\\, roten to the bone\\, we see it many time when almost slaughters dima and saying better to the fact that she is pregnant after one of his friends died pregnant\\, but stops for a kid that has already seen a lot of detth by her hands\\, it makes so little sense y so many time\\, like\\, the first aera u actualy play out of tutorial is an open area with a map u lok for weapons its cool\\, the rest of the ****ing game its a corridor\\, why did u even put that in the first place\\, elie loses everything in this game\\, his father his friends his girlfriend almost everyone and everything\\, and we see how she gets ****ed every time she has to kill someone in a cutscene but doesnt budge while fcking behading ppl that doesnt even know\\, this is actually ****ed\\, at the end of the game we see how elie after losing 2 fingers by an abbys bite\\, after killing like 1000 ppl in total lets her go\\, just like that\\, she acknowledges that revenge is bad\\, thats the plot\\, the major problem of this game is the ****ing director\\, who thinks he is the smartest person in the world and only critics can understand games\\, and he can even see the bull**** he made\\, I will say this agane in case u u didnt pick it up already\rTHIS GAME BAD DO NOT BUY EVEN WITH OTHERS PERSON MONEY NOT GOOD.\rthats as clear as I can make it\\,\rand if u think this game deserves a better rating\\, idk what to tell u\\, they lied to so many ppl\\, just for the sake of money\\, even their employees has been ****ed working for smth they wont get\\, this is fcked\\, and we all know uncharted 5 will be trash most likely cuz more than 50% of the ppl that works on ND is leaving after this project\\, they really tensed the string until they broke it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
