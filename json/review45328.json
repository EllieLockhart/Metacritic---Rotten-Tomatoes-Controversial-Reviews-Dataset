Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Utter Garbage\\, what a waste of time.  30 odd years waiting for this rubbish \\, crap all over the franchise and lore\\,  massive plot holes\\, stupid logic\\, just throw all the setup from the last movie to the curb \\, i hate this POS movie.  Shame on everyone involved in making this. You had no respect for the previous 6 movies\\, and although the prequels were not great they were still Star Wars movies.  This is not.","true":true}
