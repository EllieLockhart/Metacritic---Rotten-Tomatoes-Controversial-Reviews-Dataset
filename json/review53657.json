Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Force Awakens was a step forward but this disaster has been two steps back. The pacing was awful\\, it was littered with pointless scenes and was incredibly boring. Painful comedy\\, wasted characters and a dull plot completely ruined this film. The way they handled Luke was disgraceful to the entire franchise. This film alone ruins the entire Star Wars universe.","true":true}
