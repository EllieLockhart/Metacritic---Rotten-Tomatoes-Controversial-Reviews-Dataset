Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I utterly LOVED it. I have never seen another film that carries so much meaning\\, so much emotional depth\\, foreshadowing\\, rich character arcs and development and something that challenges and questions your ideals and indeed the very ideals of Star Wars while remaining true to the mythology that drives the universe at the core in every single frame. Gorgeous film.","true":true}
