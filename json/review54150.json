Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I feel betrayed and cheated after walking out of the theater. Bought 9 ticket for my friends and all of them where angry and upset coming out. They sold us a star wars story with our favorite characters from before. They are not the same characters. The world does not play by the rules established before. The script is a complete mess. Humor is cringe. It has bad structure. Characters are inconstant\\, stupid and not likable. The drama lacks urgency. its way to long and contains plots and story points that lead absolutely nowhere. I want a refund and memory wiped please.","true":true}
