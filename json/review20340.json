Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"it was very bad\\, the story was terrible .it was not star wars at all . they did not explain anything in this movie. very cheap the sets and setting in this movie . they did not spend one dollar on anything. no fighting either... it was very bad like if the director did not see or read any starwars movies ","true":true}
