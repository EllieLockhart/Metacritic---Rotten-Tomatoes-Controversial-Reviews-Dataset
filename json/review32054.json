Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS\\nIt's been a month since I saw The Last Jedi and I have been trying my best to forget about it. In my mind the movie was not connected in any genuine way to the Star Wars story. Luke's transformed character seemed like a silly interpretation aimed solely at subverting expectations to appear like the writer was bold and courageous. That's a false equation. And it's a shame\\, because it left a hopeful\\, devoted\\, loving (and archetypal) character who meant so much to so many people\\, depressed\\, negativistic\\, cynical\\, and dead. \\n\\nI was more than open to seeing Luke as a changed person who had gone through difficulties\\, grief\\, and trauma\\, and to see how he dealt with these struggles as a Jedi master. I did not even mind the idea of him dying\\, as sad as it would have been. George Lucas spent years thinking about\\, developing\\, and writing Luke's character and personality. To see Luke's fundamental personality be drastically changed on the whim of the director was an injustice\\, and for me\\, actually very sad (and not the good kind of sad)!","true":true}
