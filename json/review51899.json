Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A film full of regretful characters and rehashed scenes from the original trilogy\\, add to that a whole plot line which makes no difference to the story\\, \\, Finn and the gang along with Phasma\\, was utterly pointless!","true":true}
