Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Average at best. I left the theatre feeling empty and thought\\, I need to see it again. By the time I got home\\, reality set in... I do not want to see it again.\\n\\nI couldn't wait to see the development of Snoke\\, Luke training Rey and some awesome light saber fights... Nothing. Too much comedy\\, looked like a B movie at times and too many cuddlie animals. Leila in space made me want to walk out of the movie. Hammel's acting\\, on the island\\, is horrible\\, though\\, his acting at the end was great. I had to ask myself\\, where the hell was this Luke Skywalker the entire movie. BB-8 was just rediculous.\\n\\nPositives\\, Rey was good\\, decent battle at the end and that's about it.\\n\\nThe prequels just got better after this mess.\\n\\nI have never been so disappointed in a movie. The critic ratings have to be fake\\, at best\\, it's a 3\/5.","true":true}
