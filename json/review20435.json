Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I usually try not to be nit picky when reviewing action movies\\, but several lame scenes\\, unnecessary plot twists\\, and new weak characters made this movie miss the mark for me.  Yes\\, it had a some good humor\\, decent action scenes\\, but these were not enough to overcome its shortcomings.  Also\\, the movie seemed to barely hold the \\\"Star Wars\\\" feeling for long periods through out the movie.  If it wasn't a Star Wars film\\, I don't think I would have been as critical (like a 3.5 movie)\\, but being Star Wars and having high expectations I give this a 2 out of 5 (I don't know how critical reviews are over 90%!).","true":true}
