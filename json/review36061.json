Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi takes Star Wars to places it has never been. It defies expectations\\, fearlessly embracing its complicated galaxy with themes never acknowledged before. It is perhaps the first Star Wars film brave enough to change the way you comprehend the Force and the Jedi. This is not the safe\\, nostalgic reboot of The Force Awakens\\, but rather a surprising new chapter that stands out as one of the most unique tales in the Star Wars canon.","true":true}
