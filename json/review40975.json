Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie does not meet my expectations\\, but delivers an original story that is entertaining and makes you question what you think the force is. I recommend seeing it more than once to really take it in and enjoy the new direction it takes. ","true":true}
