Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars died when Luke milked the space cow. Then drank it... Or was it when he threw his lightsaber away for a cheap laugh? Actually maybe it was when Yoda turned up\\, and burned the Jedi temple down. Hang on nah\\, it was when Leia flew through space back to the ship. No but seriously\\, it was when the female leader showed so much strength in not telling anyone what her actual plan was.....or was it when Chewy decided he was a vegetarian?  \\n\\nActually nope\\, you want to know when Star Wars REALLY died? It was when Disney realised that the older loyal fans don\u0092t buy as many toys anymore. I mean sure\\, they buy the odd Star Wars shirt and cup. But there is no money in that right? The real money is in the licensing\\, merch\\, big brands selling to parents of demanding kids. And in that moment\\, the older loyal fans where ushered out of the gift shop by Disney. I mean\\, there is no point making a billion dollars with a movie if you can\u0092t follow up with another billion in merch right?\\n\\nIf you don\u0092t think this is all about making money\\, you are kidding yourself. \\n\\nStar Wars is dead. It died when that rich guy at the top decided he wanted a mansion with a better view.","true":true}
