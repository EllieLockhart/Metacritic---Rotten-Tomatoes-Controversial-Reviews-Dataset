Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic. A worthy addition to the Star Wars canon. Saw it in 3D\\, so wild! I don't understand all the complaints about the story\\, especially Luke's story arc. I read all the reviews\\, including spoilers\\, and still came away very satisfied as a lifelong Star Wars fan. A very welcome and satisfying cameo ties Luke's story together. If people want Star Wars movies stricken from the Canon\\, it should be the garbage episodes 1 through 3.","true":true}
