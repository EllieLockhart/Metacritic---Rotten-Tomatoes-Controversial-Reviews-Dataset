Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I genuinely enjoyed the film a great deal. I don't think it is a perfect film and I can easily see why people may be furious at the result\\, but the movie itself goes in brave and unique new directions that caused me personally to feel a great emotional upheaval throughout the entire movie. \\n\\nPeople are entitled to their opinions but I am very curious as to what the audience perception of the film will be in a decades time\\, much like Empire Strikes Back this film has received a great deal of backlash at its release\\, though now Empire is lauded as the superior film of all.\\n\\nI think there was much this film did right\\, the twists and turns were incredible to me and the character deaths and dramatic moments affected me deeply. Certain parts felt slightly off-kilter\\, the planet of Canto Bight felt like a little bit too much\\, but overall the movie was better than any of the first two prequel films in my humble opinion.","true":true}
