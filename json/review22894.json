Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Look\\, I created an account just becuase I wanted to talk about this film. \\nIt's bad\\, it's real bad. It's like after TFA just remade ANH and made 2 billion dollars they didn't know what do do next. The film\\, despite being the longest SW film to date\\, accomplishes very little. There are multiple major characters who die but they all feel inconsequential\\, hell they brought Phasma back to life just to kill her again (I assume she's dead this time anyway). The comedy is out of place\\, the character development is non existent\\, and the music leaves a lot to be desired. \\nI'm not mad just disappointed\\, ask yourself\\, was this the best they could do?","true":true}
