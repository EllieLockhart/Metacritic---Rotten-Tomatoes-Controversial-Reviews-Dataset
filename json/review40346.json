Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is ostensibly an okay movie. At face value\\, it was a popcorn thriller. But as a star wars devotee\\, I was horrified. This film sticks out in the star wars saga like a sore thumb\\, in the worst way. In TLJ\\, Rian Johnson took the franchise to preposterous new levels that\\, at times\\, were outright far-fetched. TLJ is a piddling fan-fiction that has defiled the franchise. I left the theatre feeling forlorn and broken. I doubt JJ Abrams can amend this hot garbage. If you didn't think Star Wars was already dead\\, this was the definitive nail in the coffin. ","true":true}
