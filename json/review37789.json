Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were good things in this movie (Adam Driver's performance among them); and it was visually stunning; but I did not like where the current director took the overall Star Wars story ... recognize the universe does not revolve around me.  SPOILER-ish: Contact a couple of the Star Destroyers accompanying us and have them jump ahead in hyperspace to cut off the Resistance ships so we're not chasing them for hours on end burning up fuel and munitions ... just a thought.","true":true}
