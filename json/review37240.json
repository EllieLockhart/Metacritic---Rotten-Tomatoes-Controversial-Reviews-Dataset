Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The pacing was poorly handled\\, with some scenes getting no time at all to breath and others taking far too long to accomplish far too little. All the mysteries they have been building too\\, teasing us with\\, turned out to be nothing at all. Everyone is firing off quips and jokes like it's a comic book movie\\, regardless of the gravity of their scene. The movie seems to exist only to put the Galaxy in  the hands of the First Order so that the Resistance can be the scrappy underdogs\\, because they wouldn't be Rebels if they were defending the Republic from invaders\\, I guess. Much of the major plot points happen for the sake of convenience\\, not because of character action or plan\\, and a lot of major developments just happen without a good reason beyond that it needed to. Honestly\\, this may well be my least favorite Star Wars movie\\, I am very disappointing\\, to see a film like this in a franchise I adored.","true":true}
