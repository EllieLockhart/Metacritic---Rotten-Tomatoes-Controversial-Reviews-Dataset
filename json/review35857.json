Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is such a mixed bag. On the one hand\\, we have a set of characters in which we have a strong franchise investment in that \\\"Galaxy far\\, far away.\\\" We have a movie that spent whatever was necessary on its sets and special effects.\\n\\nOn the other hand\\, we have so many questions that were glossed aside. We have a weak story that disappoints given the franchise and the legacy characters.\\n\\nMy reaction reminds me of how I felt about The Phantom Menace; a major disappointment given the expectations they had raised. I glad I saw it and will certainly rewatch it when its on the Premium TV channels. I still care about the resistances' outcome and what happens in the future to the characters. I just hope that IX rightens the storyline.","true":true}
