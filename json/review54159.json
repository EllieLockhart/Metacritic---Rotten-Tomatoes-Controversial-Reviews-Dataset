Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I felt massively disappointed and underwhelmed when the movie ended. I am not a die hard fan but I have seen all the movies to know the whole story. Everybody is trying to force feed humor these days. Spoiler Alerts......................................................................................................................................\\n1. Luke just throws the light saber behind his back\\, which is direct continuation from Ep VII. For all these years that light saber was the important part of him and he behaves like it is trash. \\n2. Rey's parents - what the hell. So everything in force awakens was a series of random coincidences\\, and she is right now the most powerful Jedi who is just a random girl who defeated Kylo Ren. Plus it was hyped so much up untill now. \\n3. Snoke - What a massive massive disappointment. Who was he\\, how did he became the supreme leader\\, dark side etc etc. Nothing matters\\, it just became an irrelevant plot point like Rey's parents. \\n4. In the last hour\\, every time I thought the movie would\/should end here to preserve some good storyline\\, it made another twist. In the end it just became a movie with too much hope zig zagging its way to the final point.  \\n\\nThere were plot holes but these were the top ones IMO. The director I think and a very low opinion of Ep VII and didn't care to continue and made this a standalone.","true":true}
