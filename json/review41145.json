Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has beautiful visuals\\, and absolutely no story. I saw it in the theater on opening night. It is very telling that no one in the theater clapped at the end. All were disappointed.","true":true}
