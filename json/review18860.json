Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a not a good movie it's more of a waste of time\\, but that's living up to its purpose due to the fact that its preparing u for the last chapter of the art like action compacted saga!","true":true}
