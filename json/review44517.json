Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To say that this movie is a disappointment is being too kind! This movie fundamentally underminds everything from the original trilogy. After watching the Last Jedi I actually think that the original trilogy has been weakened\\, which I thought was something that would never happen. Rian Johnson definitely took risks and in doing so\\, not only killed the best movie franchise ever but also my childhood and excitement for any Star Wars movie from now on. I went into the movie ready to love it and was completely blindsided by the horrible atrocities that is the plot of The Last Jedi. F*** You Rian Johnson.. F*** You!","true":true}
