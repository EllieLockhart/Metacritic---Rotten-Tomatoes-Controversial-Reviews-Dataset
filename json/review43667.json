Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was. . .sad. Leaving aside the heavy handed moralizing that has everyone so up in arms\\, there was no movie to speak of. There was a series of cameos by characters and objects that populate what used to be the Star Wars universe. They had no lives\\, no stories\\, and seemingly no purpose other than serving as props for action sequences. Apparently\\, for the people and critics who enjoyed it\\, the dogma was more important than a story full of gaping plot holes and characters that were as flat and flavorless as cardboard. A waste of a legacy\\, and an insult to fans.","true":true}
