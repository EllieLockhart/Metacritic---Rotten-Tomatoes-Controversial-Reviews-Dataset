Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The good:  For the most part\\, the visuals are very good.  Outstanding\\, even.  I wouldn't be surprised if it won awards for that sort of stuff.\\n\\nThe bad:  Everything else.  The Last Jedi continues breaking the movies that came before it\\, and trampling all over the lore. \\n\\nRey is even more powerful with the Force and more skillful with a lightsaber this time around\\, even though it starts right when the last movie ends\\, and she received virtually no training from Luke.  It's absurd.\\n\\nIf it's one thing that 40 years of lore has taught\\, it's that it takes years of training\\, practice and dedication to become proficient with Force use\\, and to become skillful with a lightsaber.  If the aptitude is even there.  The Force does not give one the knowledge or skill to do anything\\, it can only greatly enhance and augment the ability that one already has.  \\n\\nAbrams and Johnson believe that the Force works like the Matrix.  That if you can feel the Force\\, it simply downloads the required knowledge and skill into you\\, eliminating any need to learn or train.  That isn't how the Force works.  It's unconscionable that the writers were handed the reigns to this franchise when they have such little fundamental understanding of Star Wars.\\n\\nSo what about all of those unanswered questions and needed exposition that The Mystery Box Awakens left?  Most are still a mystery and unanswered.  Let's be honest\\, they never will be.\\n\\nSimply because Disney Wars has shifted genres from space opera\\, science fiction \/ fantasy.... to fantasy action\\, because that's where the money is.  The genre's primary focus is to entertain.  It has common elements:  Crazy CGI action scenes\\, constant forced humor\\, nothing making any sense\\, the \\\"story\\\" being an afterthought.  Flash over substance.  See: Transformers.","true":true}
