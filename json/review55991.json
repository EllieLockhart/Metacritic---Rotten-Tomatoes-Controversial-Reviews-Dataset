Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Simply my least favorite star wars to date (Behind even the prequels). The plot felt forced at times\\, Leia apparently has a new force power that both Jedi and Sith master beforehand could never seem to grasp\\, Luke has his character morphed into a shell of what the entire series has built him to be\\, and thirty minutes of time was wasted on a casino planet that ultimately was useless to the story (for characters that felt hollow). The movie was very visually striking\\, but overall a disservice to long-time Star-Wars fans that left glaring plot holes and more desired from a storytelling aspect. Not to mention everything about Snoke was unanswered and his death made little sense (if he was some ultra powerful Sith master\\, why couldn't he notice such a simple move?)","true":true}
