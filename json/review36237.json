Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi will be my last Star Wars movie.  The \\\"Fresh\\\" film draws to light the unfortunate truth that this film was just too big to fail -too many people were due to make millions and could not afford for it to flop. This trend will continue.  It's unfortunate because the truly creative films out there will be overshadowed by the tide of Disney and their mediocre blockbusters. The force was not with this one.","true":true}
