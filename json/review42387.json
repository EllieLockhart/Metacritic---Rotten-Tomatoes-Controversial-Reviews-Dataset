Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was absolute garbage of a story. The disrespect to Luke\\, to Lucas\\, to the star wars brand was revolting. It's to bad people are still going to see this. One thing I do know is you just killed your most die hard fans just to cater the casuals. Believe me when I say that star wars is just a faze and will pass. When it does not only did you lose your hardcore fans but you will lose your casuals too.","true":true}
