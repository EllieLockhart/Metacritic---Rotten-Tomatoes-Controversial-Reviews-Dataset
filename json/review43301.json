Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a good entertaining movie. However\\, this was not the GREAT movie that the star wars series deserves. I really wished that they told a star wars story that flowed and made sense. I have no problem with any political undertones\\, the side of the rebels has always been an inclusive side. I just wished it was a story that made the star wars universe seem like such a large\\, genuine place like the other movies did. This film doesn't make sense and it is a knock to the star wars series. It was entertaining the first time through but I will not be re-watching.","true":true}
