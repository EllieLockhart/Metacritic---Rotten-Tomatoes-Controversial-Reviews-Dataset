Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Why did Disney \/ Rian Johnson see fit to take such a huge gamble with the direction of the Skywalker trilogy of trilogies in what was its penultimate act?\\n\\nIf anything this movie needed to be the glue holding VII and IX together but for me it just destroyed the Skywalker saga with a whole film to go. Astounding. I just don\u0092t get the thought process.\\n\\nI think Rian Johnson and Disney will ultimately pay for a price for this move further down the linear well they should. As for the critics score\\, they either know nothing about Star Wars or have been paid off. \\n\\nI\u0092m ok with taking Star Wars to new places. But this went way too far and it just ended up being a complete mess of a movie. One that lacked script\\, plot\\, meaningful direction and cohesion. \\n\\nThe time to take a gamble on a new direction for Star Wars was after IX\\, not at such a crucial point in the saga as VIII.\\n\\nA shameful travesty of a film that openly mocks a cultural institution that has brought joy to so many people for over 40 years.","true":true}
