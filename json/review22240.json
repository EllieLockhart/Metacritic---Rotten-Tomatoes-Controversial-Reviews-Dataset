Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Leah does not have the force so how in the world did she survive when her part of the ship was blown to bits?","true":true}
