Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was great.  Rather than rehashing what we've seen before like in the last one\\, the last Jedi made some bold decisions that I think paid off.  This film sought to separate this series from what came before\\, which is why I think some people disliked it but I think that is exactly what was needed.  My only complaint was that some of the jokes felt a little out of place for the universe\\, but overall I loved the ride this movie took me on","true":true}
