Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson tried to make an Avenger films using the Star Wars Saga. A lot of stupid jokes\\, Finn and his girlfriend aports nothing to the film\\, Luke Skywalker was badly developed\\, Leia aka Mary Poppins Cosmos was horrendous\\, Snoke was a joke and Rei laghs in the face of all of the Jedi that put all his life training to be a Jedi. She only neede -1 class. \\nI hope Disney redo the Saga before they totally destroys it.","true":true}
