Good mechanics\\, game-play\\, music and graphics which is why it got a one.  But oh the story.  No choices\\, railroaded into a path regardless of player desire.  I understand wanting to show and teach with games but this wasn't that.  This was not a lesson in anything other than hopelessness and getting trapped in a path and not being able to change from it. The so called lesson?  That violence and revenge cost you everything in the end.  True.  No one has to play video games to know that.  That humans suck?   Yeah\\, I think we all know that at this point.  I do not play games to experience the ugliness of life.  Games for me are a place to explore and escape.  Not to be beaten with the ugliness that already is. What is the point of playing a game that is no different that what is on the TV or out my front door?  2020 is hard enough as it is.  Shame on you Naughty Dogs.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
