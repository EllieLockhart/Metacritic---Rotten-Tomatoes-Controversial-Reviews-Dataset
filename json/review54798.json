Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think the only praise I have for this movie is  that it's not as bad as Attack of the Clones. \\n\\nPlotwise\\, it's a mess\\, the Finn and Rose plot is just pointless filler which felt taken right from the prequels. The Resistance plot is just a ridiculously slow ship chase\\, with the final result being that a few escaped alive\\, which would be OK if it wasn't celebrated as an inspiring victory by the movie. \\n\\nThe Jedi plot had some good scenes which were overshadowed by an out of character Luke Skywalker and  both Rey and Kylo Ren don't move an inch from the mental places they were at the end of the previous movie. She's the good Jedi and he's the bad Sith\\, we have a very weak explanation about why he does what he does and no explanation at all about why she does what she does. Seriously underwhelming.\\n\\nThe most disappointing aspect is that this movie shows itself as making hard questions and offering serious change in this universe. But it's a lie\\, the things stay the same as ever at the end of the movie.\\n\\nThe movie tries to have it both ways\\, it talks the talks about the need of leaving the past behind and changing the old order\\, but it doesn't walk the walk. In the end we have a Sith as the head the First Order which is the new Empire and a Sith in the Resistance which is the new Rebellion. \\n\\nThe movie very bluntly tells you that it's about failure and how it teaches you\\, but the characters never face the consequences for their actions. So\\, it fails in what it sets out to be.","true":true}
