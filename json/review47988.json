Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While I won't pretend to understand how and if Ryan Johnson had full creative freedom while writing The Last Jedi\\, I will say that it starts where we thought it would and ends where nobody expected. While Disney Executives and Kathleen Kennedy may be rejoicing (or pretending to be) over the multiple surprises offered up in this release\\, what they fail to comprehend is that this brand of surprise they are serving is not an \\\"oh wow\\, I can't believe that just happened!\\\"\\, it is much more of a \\\"Oh no\\, please tell me that didn't just happen!\\\".","true":true}
