Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was poorly written. The pacing was bad. It felt more like a collection of side stories thrown together without a main purpose until the very end. The Canto Bight scene took unnecessary time away from more important things like backstories\\, and character delvelopment. Rey hasn't really developed as a character. The handling and treatment of Luke Skywalker was awful. It feels almost like they are trolling long time Star Wars fans and purposely subverting expectations just for the sake of doing so\\, and overall it didn't feel quite like a Star Wars film. The lack of lightsaber battles is a minus as well.","true":true}
