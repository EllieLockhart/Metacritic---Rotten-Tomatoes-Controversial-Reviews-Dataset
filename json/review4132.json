Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Broke all the Lore\\, and every rule of starwars. Characters completely used as character development props\\, cringey and awkward acting by the new girl (fins love interest\\, she was so unimpressionable I couldn't remember her name) and others\\, and loose ends everywhere\\, even for a second installment of a three part series. It had so much potential\\, and threw all of it away. Only a miracle can help Abrams recover this dumpster fire in the finale.","true":true}
