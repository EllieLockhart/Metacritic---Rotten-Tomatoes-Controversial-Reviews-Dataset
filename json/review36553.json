Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie had a real strange tone to it compared to all the other movies. It was all over the place\\, scenes were over the top\\, characters were wasted\\, so many questions remain unanswered\\, locations were bland and there was also a few weird moments. No awesome fight scenes exception one short bit\\, and battle scenes were pointless or just wasted. It didn't feel like Star Wars at all.","true":true}
