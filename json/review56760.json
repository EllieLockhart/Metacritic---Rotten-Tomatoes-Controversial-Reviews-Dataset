Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was horrible on so many levels. The jokes were awful and not implemented properly\\, to the point where it took away from the suspense or drama built up in a scene. This isn't guardians of the galaxy\\, its Star Wars. All most all the characters are shallow shells\\, with no background and no continuity from the previous film. Director\/Writer Rian Johnson could not make us care about these characters if he paid us to do so. Adam driver puts out a decent performance. Overall they should be ashamed with what they did to Mark Hamill and to Luke. Seems like Rian was clouded by the literal dark side during production. I feel bad for the actors and staff where involved in the creation of this film. \\n\\nI also really wish Lucasfilms stuck with JJ Abrams for episode 8\\, because now there is nothing to look forward to in EP9\\, no matter what miracle JJ could perform on this now mess of a trilogy.","true":true}
