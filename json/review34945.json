Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film left me wondering what I'd just watched for 2.5 hours as it didn't seem to have a point. Major characters like Finn were left to do... nothing. He had no purpose in this movie--even his dialogue was stilted\\, awkward\\, cliched\\, and not particularly memorable (I can't remember a single thing he said). And this was a main character in TFA--reduced to this! Additionally\\, no exposition was provided when we sorely needed it\\, and some points TFA made were just rehashed as if we needed a reminder. Rey was fleshed out some more but all other returning characters remained stagnant and new characters (mainly Rose) were misplaced and one-dimensional. The \\\"moral\\\" of the story was also extremely heavy-handed\\, with the characters outright stating as if the audience were too dumb to understand. For me\\, the most memorable parts of this movie were the nostalgic throwbacks and that's just bad writing.","true":true}
