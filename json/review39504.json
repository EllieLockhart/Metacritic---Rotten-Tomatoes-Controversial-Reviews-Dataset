Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film surprised me\\, being as good as it was. This film feels more like Star Wars than The Force Awakens or any of the prequel films. The visuals and sound are brilliant in this film and it is definitely the most visually pleasing Star Wars film for me so far. The majority of the actors in this film are phenomenal; Daisy Ridley\\, Oscar Isaac\\, Adam Driver\\, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher are all brilliant regardless of some questionable scenes. Although the film was rather long\\, I was captivated the majority of the time\\, and it didn't feel like a chore watching any of it. It also improves upon what I felt The Force Awakens got wrong where it was just a huge cliche\\, attempted to have been covered with nostalgia. The film is actually quite unpredictable in places and throws a lot of the old cliches away whilst keeping some of the more interesting ones. As much as I loved this film though I do have a few gripes with it\\, mainly the Finn\/Rose sub-plot and a certain questionable force power that makes for an awkward scene that really pulled me out of the film for a minute and made me cringe to a new extreme (you'll know what I'm talking about) and although I'm slightly annoyed at the way they threw away the chance to explain some backstory for Rey and Snoke\\, I'm also glad they decided not to in some form as it makes it less of a cookie cutter Star Wars story. The misuse of Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie) yet again is also a huge disappointment as there is so much more that could have been done with the character instead of trying to force the Boba Fett vibe with her.\\nAltogether though I absolutely loved this movie\\, and it's currently my 2nd\/3rd favourite Star Wars film as I'm struggling to decide (a third viewing will probably help me there) and I would definitely reccomend watching it\\, especially if you enjoy Star Wars in any form!","true":true}
