Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Incoherence with the rest of the movies. Including  some kind of telepathic presence without be there... Worst movie in the saga by far. Its a copy in many sense of the learning sequence in Star Wars V (Yoda to Luke - Luke to the girl) .  The truly Disaster Movie.","true":true}
