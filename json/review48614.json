Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worse than the prequels. Trite\\, almost non existent plot. Boring\\, corny\\, uninspiring. I had hope that Rian Johnson would infuse some creativity and life into this franchise. Instead we get cute penguins and a flying Princess Leia. Awful.","true":true}
