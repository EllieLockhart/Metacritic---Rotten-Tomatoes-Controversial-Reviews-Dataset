Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My initial feelings after the movie were mostly \\\"meh\\\"\\, not very good storytelling but compelling visuals. However\\, as time went by and I thought more about it\\, the story really is quite bad. Characters are behaving in completely stupid and inconsistent ways to get a laugh from the audience\\, starting right from the beginning scene; the entire second arc is built on characters not speaking with one another (Holdo and Poe's mutiny)\\, which is just cheap storytelling; many things\\, like Leia's force-walk\\, Luke wanting to kill a child or the hyperspace jump attack are breaking internal consistency with all prior movies; deus ex machina galore; the new order as enemies are so incompetent in all they do\\, that the movie never creates any tension because you know they WILL mess up this time again; important characters from the first movie\\, like Snoke\\, are just thrown away... not just consuming this movie passively\\, but actively thinking about it made me feel incredibly disappointed in the storytelling and internal consistency of the universe. I just can't unsee the plotholes\\, clich\u00e9 tropes and character demolition for cheap laughs.","true":true}
