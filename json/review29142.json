Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really wasn\u2019t a great installment to the Star Wars franchise. We really need J.J. Abrams back\\, he actually knows how to write and direct; this movie tried too hard to be funny and was completely cheesy at its core. Not the worst Star Wars installment\\, but didn\u2019t live up to the 2 year hiatus.","true":true}
