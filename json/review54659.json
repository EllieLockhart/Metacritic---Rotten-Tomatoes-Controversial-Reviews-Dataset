Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In truth the worst part of this movie is that it is obvious that a lot of time and effort went into the production of it. When executed though this movie is a hot mess of plot points that don't mesh well with one another. I personally hate the portrayal of some of my most treasured childhood heroes such as Luke and Leia ad they are left just shells of the characters I once loved. I am ashamed to see Star Wars to fall so low it is no longer is distinguishable from the torrent of thoughtless films that populate Hollywood and if this trend doesn't reverse itself I believe i'll drop the franchise.","true":true}
