Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it\\, very fresh. This is a film made to move this franchise forward. Seriously though\\, the guys that want a rehash of everything that's already been done at least once before\\, why would you want to pay again for something that you've already consumed? I get your sentiments\\, trust me\\, I watched beauty and the beast this year and it was a total rehash of the animated film\\, and I walked out of the theater with a huge smile on my face because Disney has basically sold me a portion of my childhood\\, now that I think about it... it was dumb of me to think that\\, and I mean really dumb! Because I no longer condone that\\, after TLJ I gotta say TFA is looking less of a good product\\, because although both TFA and Beauty and the Beast are competent films\\, they're just rehashes of other products that I already love... and there's no reason for me to PAY for those again. Having got that out of the way\\, this film is very enjoyable to watch\\, the plot was \\\"thick\\\"\\, and there were a lot of characters in this film\\, however\\, they were all given things to do and I'm happy with that. Of course\\, the force sensitive\/ jedi characters plots were the most entertaining from the movie. I liked Luke's character arc\\, I loved his arc in the OT trilogy and his arcs in EU material\\, having said that... he was very much human in this film\\, less like Superman and more like Luke Skywalker. The Kylo Ren\/Rey stuff were probably the highlight\\, with the Red Room being the most notable part. I loved the faceoff between Luke and Kylo at the end\\, and the culmination of Luke's arc in this film \\\"He's back baby!\\\". I still don't know why they killed him off\\, he'll be back as a force ghost in the next one\\, and since Carrie Fischer did pass away\\, they should have shifted her character arc in the 3rd film onto Luke with performing the necessary plot adjustments to that arc\\, or cancelled hers entirely and made a new alternative one for Luke Skywalker... I don't think the fans can tolerate the absence of all 3 OT leads from a sequel film.","true":true}
