Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fans will be disappointed.\\n\\nMovie critics and new fans will claim you're entitled and this movie was the best of the series.\\n\\nDisney has done a great job introducing a brand new Star Wars franchise to drain what's left of the Star Wars brand George Lucas created. As a business person\\, the new lightsabers\\, droids\\, spaceships\\, etc. make new opportunities for toys\\, books\\, video games. Especially by eliminating the entire expanded universe of 40+ years.  Disney will reap the benefits of destroying one of the best storylines in literature and fiction. \\n\\nIf you're looking for a movie with compelling character development\\, an emotional plot\\, and the magic and wonder of \\\"the force\\\"\\, this isn't the movie you're looking for.","true":true}
