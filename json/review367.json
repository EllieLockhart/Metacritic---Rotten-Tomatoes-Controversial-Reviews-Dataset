The evening does not proceed as expected and ends with the disappearance of two twin sisters. To try to move forward in their grieving\\, the group decide to get together the following year in the same cabin. Unfortunately for them\\, this trip will quickly turn into a nightmare. The choices you select will have a weight on the outcome of the scenario.\r\rSo I have played it and I must say and I didn't have the highest expectations for it. The marketing is exactly how it turned out but it's not the route I would have taken for the game. I think something more ballsier and I am talking about the short QTEs thrown in\\, surveying the environment\\, exploration\\, character development. All these things that make it what it is: An interactive movie - It is formulaic in a lot of ways\\, and it still felt like that same T.V slasher-cheese fest formula we are used to.\r\rLet's talk about the good things: multiplayer engagement - playing the game is best played cooperatively imo. Someone assumes the controller and there is hot seat rotation. As you progress\\, so does shouting unanimously and voting between the choices that appear as a group - creating an atmosphere of participation and engagement that works well with the survival horror themes the developers have geared it towards - rotating around eight playable ensemble characters throughout the game.\r\rNow about the gripes and things: as the characters are introduced in the beginning\\, I could not help but feel this showcase of friendship seems forced and not genuine and random. I don't buy it. It is as if the dialogue is the same kind of quirky dialogue and the voice of one strong writer buried under others. Character archetypes and narrative writing mashed together to create this friendship circle. Yet somehow\\, none of the characters really share many compatible social traits borne of real emotion for one another. Seldom there are some really great concepts going on for the characters but they never really develop. It doesn't help that the mo-capped actors' ages range larger than their in-game counterparts\\, but the script and dialogue for me personally is not there.\r\rAlso - WTF - most of the characters have a tendency of scaring each other\\, verbally abusing one another\\, screaming. Both rather funny and deeply unnerving; perfectly calm one minute and then melodramatic. There is a good amount of tension but for goodness sake. The quirks are no substitute for actual character traits. These jump-scares combined with cheesy line reading\\, the game is reminiscent of slasher films: Cabin in the Woods\\, Saw\\, Scream\\, but I mean like we are reacquainted with some of the most obvious recycled tropes going. But it does not really commit to one of these films and is fun mess overall.\r\rThere are romances and couplets happening too - the story follows a simple pattern based on this idea might look as follows: the storyline cuts between two characters at a time\\, most of the time\\, once the party are split. There's even friendship mechanics in the menu options with metres and emotions...\\, But for the most part this feature feels unpolished\\, cosmetic and filler - not really offering much to the gameplay. There is no real emotional core\\, no real development\\, nothing to learn from it. What is going on.\r\rThe main girl character\\, Samantha (Hayden Panettiere) and the main guy character\\, Michael (Brett Dalton) develop interestingly. More so Emily who after giving the best worst manner of first impression I can remember in a long time becomes tolerable later on and centre of some cool QTEs. We all fall on hard-times I suppose.\r\rSeeing as how this is an movie blanketed as an interactive game\\, what really delineates from one another is the linear interactive progression with slapped-on\\, adrenaline pulsing QTEs. But the player-controller mechanics themselves are not particularly varied. Sprinkled throughout and repetitive in form.\r\rWhat's really bizarre is the reveal of \\\"the stranger\\\"\\, aka Flamethrower man. What are you trying to do with this character. In the middle of nowhere we actually have this really cool guy. Something happens to him later on... he's managed to survive this crap. We want to invest time in him (because he's not a college student and has shifted in some power-control). It's kind of embarrassing for him... I feel bad for him... Yeah.\r\rIn summary\\, this game is very weird in a likeable way but not in a way I would recommend it to someone who would play it alone. What I will say it is entirely watchable. The strength lies in the conceptual framework of group-play and bawling at the cheesy tensions it provides through to the very end.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
