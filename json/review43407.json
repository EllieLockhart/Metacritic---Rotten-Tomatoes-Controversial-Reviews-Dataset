Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was an incredible Star Wars film. I think we have to go in without expectations\\, and too many people went in wanting to to be what they expected. I don't really understand why people say it expands the ideas of the force or the Jedi\\, I just believe it was an incredibly well told character journey for these heroes. I do with that there was a little back story for Snoke and I'm not sure I believe that Rey's background is what we saw\\, after all\\, there is a \\\"certain point of view\\\" to consider. I think the full value of this trilogy will not be evident until the final piece is in place.","true":true}
