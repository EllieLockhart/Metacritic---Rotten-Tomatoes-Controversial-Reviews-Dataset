Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Carrie Poppins\\, The destruction of characters like Hux\\, Poe Dameron or Luke Skywalker\\, the hyperspace ramming that will make any turbolaser battle (or anything that is not a fleet of drones hyperspace ramming other ships) look completely ridiculous\\, the forced\\, tone-deaf and out of place jokes\\, the plot in the casino planet that will make you miss pod racing\\, the defusing of any interesting plot device set up by J.J. Abrams (Rey's parents\\, Snoke\\, Luke's Lightsaber)... A long list of sins that has turned The Last Jedi into the most divisive Star Wars movie ever made. Visually it has its virtues\\, but the Plot is a mess.","true":true}
