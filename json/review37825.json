Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were so many silly moments in this movie.  If I had to pick a point at which the movie irrevocably passed the point of no return it would be undead Leia force flying through the dead of space.\\n\\nMy friends and I really hated this movie. No more star wars movies for me.","true":true}
