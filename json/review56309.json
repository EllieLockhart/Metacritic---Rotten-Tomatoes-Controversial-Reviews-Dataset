Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Strange enough have the critics give this a thumbs up.\\nIt's the worst Star Wars movies ever. It's entertaining\\, but its not a Starwars Movie.\\nit's not a movie to remember\\, unless you are a big FAN of Starwars and are so angry how bad it is.\\n\\nFor my point of view\\, did Disney and Rian Destroy Star Wars in \\ntheir zeal to create a different film that should show new ways\\, by killing of the old.\\n\\nI have never made a review at Rotten Tomatoes\\, but disney excuse for getting poor rating on TLJ due to Trolls and bots\\nmakes me so mad\\, that I have to write one.\\nSo since the TLJ got so good Tomatometer from reviewer\\, Disney may have used Trolls them self??? or payed others to make\\nbetter review???\\n\\nPS: i am not a bot\\, im just a FAN that is very disapoined over The Last Jedi and the way of Disney and Rian path.\\npersonal I think there were to much SpaceBalls over it\\, and inflation of #METOO in TLJ.","true":true}
