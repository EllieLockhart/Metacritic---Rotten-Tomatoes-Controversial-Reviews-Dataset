Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a die-hard fan of the Star Wars film series\\, I really have to say that this episode VIII is the worst one! It really can't compare with the last seven ones but to be eliminated. The whole plot sucks! Especially\\, those storylines surronds with Poe Dameron\\, Finn and Rose Tico are really like a bunch of failures. I feel very disappointed with the eighth film of my beloved Star Wars film series. I hope the next one\\, as we know as the end of the sequel trilogy wouldn't be as terrible as this one but to be as excellent as the previous seven ones.","true":true}
