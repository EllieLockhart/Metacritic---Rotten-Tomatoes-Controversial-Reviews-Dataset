Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars the last Jedi was not that great just ok. There where some cool fights such as Finn vs Plasma! And now Ray has to learn from Luke the ways of the force and to become a Jedi. Kylo is trying to have Ray join him. She\u2019ll that happen you find out! My favorite character is Finn\\, Rose\\, DJ. and silly parts to the movie. Such as DJ he was a silly one. I suggest we get director JJ Abrams he could do a better job for the next Star Wars. Before I forget the cast was good to the movie! I hope episode 9 will be better people should not give up on Star Wars!!!! Have some faith!!","true":true}
