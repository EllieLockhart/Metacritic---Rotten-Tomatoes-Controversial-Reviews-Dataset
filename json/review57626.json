Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too long\\, to disconnected\\, no heart\\,.  Sequences run like empire but in reverse... Didn't need to see the Vegas version of Tom Tom's wow looks while scene copy have been cut... All character dev from last movie is lost for villains\\,. New characters Dev is faster than light speed.. Did I mention it was too long they could have made this into 8 & 9 and be there end of it... How many times do they need to through in death start tech can they just come up with a new movie and stop trying to re re re re hash re hashed themes... I saw so many critic reviews comparing it to Empire.. This was no Empire... Rogue One just officially kicked LJ's butt.\\nI will say Mark Hamill's performance was great.... Force awakens and rogue one couldn't wait to to see it second time in theater.... Last Jedi I'll wait to see on Netflix in 2 years....","true":true}
