Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a Star Wars fan all my life\\, but this movie is actually really really bad. I am pretty disappointed. I don't know if people's standards for movies have fallen\\, or maybe the hype blinded them\\, but it's really poorly written. There are so many things that just don't add up in the movie. Some of the character's are just awfully developed. Really cheesy movie overall. So much potential in Ray and Kylo Ren's characters--they were the only things I liked about the movie. Everything else\\, sucked\\, except for the visuals which were stunning. I can't believe this.","true":true}
