Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I AM AN EPIC STAR WARS NERD \/ GURU \/ FANBOY; and owe my childhood and adult hood to star wars.................. the director clearled hated everything about star wars and pissed all over it like Rick Berman did to star trek franchise. i dont blaime disney cause the animated series\\, comics\\, games\\, and side movies are WAY better than this pile of steaming nerf-herder dung!","true":true}
