Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"a very disappointing Star Wars movie\\, it abandoned and abruptly ended many threads from Episode 7 that were meant to be decently resolved or explored. it did nothing to further the story of the trilogy in that we're basically where we were when Ep 7 ended. Finn was relagated to tertiary character and used in a useless subplot. I have no anticipation for Ep 9 now\\, and I'm not sure how good a movie it can be given that this movie left it with very little to work with. ","true":true}
