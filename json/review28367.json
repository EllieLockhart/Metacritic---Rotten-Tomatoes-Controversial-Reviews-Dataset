Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"possibly one of the worst movies I have seen in regards to story in some time. The acting is passable\\, the music and effects were spot on but not enough to save this trash fire. It is clear\\, that Johnson pretty much tossed Abrams script in the garbage and lit it on fire.","true":true}
