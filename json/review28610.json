Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Production quality of course is high on this film but the directing and writing was awful. I wouldn\u2019t pay to see the movie when you have so many good prospects on Disney+\\,Netflix\\, Hulu and Amazon prime video.","true":true}
