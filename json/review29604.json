Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson's addition to the Star Wars film canon felt more like a low-budget\\, hastily written\\, absolute mess of a fan film. I honestly couldn't tell if I was watching a group of weird pilot episodes for TV shows that would never air... or a YouTube video that was so bad I couldn't look away. The over-use of humor and \\\"cute factor\\\"\\, weird\\, confusing and pointless plot points\\, worthless new characters\\, and a villain so wasted you'll begin to wonder if you accidentally walked into a screening of the prequels. \\nI did not like The Last Jedi. It is the only Star Wars film I have walked away from disappointed. And that really hurts me to say.","true":true}
