Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great movie. I am a huge Star Wars fan. While there were  a few holes in the movie I don't think the 1\/2 Star reviews on here are even valid. We had a blast with this movie and are showing had peoplke cheering. We spent slot of time at the theater and heard no complaints. I think people are just jumping on a band wagon and claiming this movie was terrible","true":true}
