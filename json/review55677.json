Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the worst star wars films. It waste so much time on plots that lead to no were. It disconnects from the previous movie since a new director who wrote his own movie with out a care what was laid out before it. \\nIt's worth seeing since there are some cool scenes but man there are so many not needed jokes that it takes u out of the film and border lines corny aka now this is pod racing. The Last guarding makes an appearance. It also kills of old characters for no reason and takes a beloved character and turns him in to something u know he would never be come or do things u know he would never do.","true":true}
