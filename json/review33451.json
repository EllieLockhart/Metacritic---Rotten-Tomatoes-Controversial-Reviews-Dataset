Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible acting and pointless plot that seems to revolve around the painfully slow pursuit between ships capable of light speed. All battle scenes lack any real logic or sense. Daisy is great\\, Driver is better than last go\\, and Hamel is surprisingly not completely terrible. I'd rank it 6th behind 5\\, 4\\, 6\\, 3\\, and Rogue. Easily better than 1\\, 2\\, and 7.","true":true}
