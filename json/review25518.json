Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No Spoilers: I really enjoyed the movie\\, there were a lot of pilot twists and appearances of old friends. I have watched it 4 times now and each viewing I get a glimpse of something that strikes me in a new way. The characters are rich\\, the scenery is all SW and more\\, and their are moments of tears with tons of laughter.","true":true}
