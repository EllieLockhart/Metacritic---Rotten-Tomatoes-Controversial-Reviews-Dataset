Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Okay\\, what in the holy jesus fudgecakes is the internet thin-- Okay. I won't disrespect everyone else's opinions\\, but this is my personal favorite star wars movie! I mean\\, yes\\, luke dies\\, but in a really good scene. And the movie worked--- It clicked. The only real reason the internet went bezerk is because a bunch of crazy fanboys complained that since their hero died\\, this was 'The worst movie ever.' Well they're wrong.\\nI give this 5 stars.","true":true}
