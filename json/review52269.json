Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A generally average movie with some good moments and flashy special effects. While not good\\, it's not completely awful either and has elements I enjoyed. Plot doesn't truly make sense and the new characters are immensely unlikable. Luke Skywalker also feels like a completely different person. Maybe worth it if you can watch it for free.","true":true}
