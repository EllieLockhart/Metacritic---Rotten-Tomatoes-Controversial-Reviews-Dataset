Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An utter character assassination on Luke Skywalker. It was like that episode of South Park with Spielberg and Lucas doing unspeakable things to Indiana Jones\\, but worse. This went on for two and a half snooze-inducing hours. Boring and inconsequential subplots that have no relation to the main conflict. Extensive cross-cutting. Cheap humor at the expense of the lore. Rey's journey is bland as a shaved potato. Waste. Hubris. Idiocy. No answers or respect for the past films. No understanding of mythology. Tone-deaf dialogue and boring direction. Lazy cinematography and choreography. This is the worst Star Wars film and I am done with Disney Star Wars. It's no longer canon to me and this is the last time I'm paying to see anything produced by Disney in theaters\\, ever. Give me 200 million dollars and I would have made a far better movie than this piece of trash. The Porgs were cute\\, though. \\n\\nPS.: I say all this as a former big fan of Rian Johnson's past 3 films and someone who has followed his career closely. I could not have been more disappointed with this.\\n\\nGet this. Rotten Tomatoes deleted my initial review on here\\, despite my account going back to 2004 and my having posted many reviews prior and being an active forum poster (back in the forum days)! Was it because I mentioned my essay\\, \\\"On the Character Assassination of Luke Skywalker\\\"\\, which now has over 20\\,000 views on Medium?!? Go ahead\\, delete my review again! I'll just write another one!\\n\\nI'll have you all know\\, after I wrote my 8\\,000+ word essay\\, three days later\\, my YouTube channel was suddenly served with 6 DMCA copyright takedown notices over music\\, and a memorial video for my late sister\\, who was 13 at the time of her death\\, was taken down!! Way to bully your fans\\, Disney! I'm officially boycotting everything you produce!\\n\\nIf I have to read one more article calling me stupid\\, sexist\\, or racist for disliking a badly made film\\, I'm going to unleash a social media shitstorm the likes of which you can't possibly imagine!!\\n\\nYOU CAN'T GET AWAY WITH MURDERING STAR WARS!!! You've declared war on the Star Wars fanbase and we won't forget it!!","true":true}
