Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the worst star wars movie by far\\, a position episode II had previously held for me. This movie had the worst plot of any movie\\, brought in useless characters\\, ruined cannon star wars concepts (like weaponizing lightspeed)\\, and worst of all\\, Johnson completely destroyed the character of Luke. So thankful that Abrams sequel undid so much of what this movie tries to ruin.","true":true}
