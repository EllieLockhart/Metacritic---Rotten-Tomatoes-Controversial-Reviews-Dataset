Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It\u2019s really hard to believe how disappointing The Last Jedi was. I am a life long Star Wars fan and looked forward to this movie for 2 years. The franchise seems lost. I can\u2019t even say I am interested in what will happen in episode IX at this point.","true":true}
