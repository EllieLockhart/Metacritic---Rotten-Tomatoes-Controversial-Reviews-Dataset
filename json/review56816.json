Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The poorest of all...the worst of all...no wait...there's Episode 1!!! Man..this movie rivals with the worst Star Wars film ever. Sadly\\, it kills the hype for Episode 9 and the spin-offs. The faith was fragile after the terrible Eps 1-3; Ep 7 gave us a light of hope; Rogue One elevated us to a new dawn of Star Wars...and the fall hits harder when you're far up. Ep 8 fails in almost everything; lacks of a good story\\, performances and passion. It has abundant void characters (hey Phasma...2 in a row!) DJ\\, Admiral Holdo\\, even Luke! Sad\\, sad\\, sad story. Star Wars is almost dead...all my doubts to an Ep 9. I won't be going to the movies for the opening...I give you my word.","true":true}
