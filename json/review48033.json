Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While not the worst movie\\, it's not very good either.  It's like the movie had 2 writers with 2 different stories. One was harrowing\\, but constantly Interrupted by an alternate weak storyline. Carrie Fisher\\, not a good performance. Yoda is about the most evolved and interestin in this one.  Porgs initially ok\\, but over used and turned into furby minion tribbles.  Liked Laura Dern a lot in this.  Comedy wasn't welcomein the manner presented.","true":true}
