Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow. I suspected I wasn't going to like this chapter of the Star Wars saga but I had no idea it would wind up spraying figurative fecal matter over my appreciation for the whole series. It is just so very bad in every regard expect for the visual. No logic\\, rhyme or reason to anything. No room for it I guess\\, with all the PC crap jam packed in there. Who knew a light speed engine on a hulk of metal was the ultimate anti ship weapon all along? Who knew you could open doors into space and simply pull stuff in from the other side. Why not simply ban white men from the franchise altogether (except for roles as evil clowns of course) and be done with it? You're not fooling anyone you know. Oh and throw in some more cute critters while you're at it. And choke on 'em.  F*ck Star Wars and f'ck Disney.","true":true}
