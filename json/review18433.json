Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is sad what they did to Luke. Ruined the character. Obviously they have no clue or care about the story or what fans want. Speaking of story..  \\,  How is it that the most powerful Jedi ever had to train for years just to pull of some little tricks \\, but rey has it all down right out of the box.","true":true}
