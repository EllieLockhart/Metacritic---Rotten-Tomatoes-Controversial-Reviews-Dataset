Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very long and tedious. Characters we don't care about. Disney garbage. Our family were United in our dislike of this film.  My 12 year old son was looking at my watch every 10 minutes and sitting with his head between his hands. No more please.","true":true}
