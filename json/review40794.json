Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This Movie answered A LOT of questions we had from The Force Awakens and it left me with a feeling of why is there going to be a episode 9 other then that i have no other complaints from the movie","true":true}
