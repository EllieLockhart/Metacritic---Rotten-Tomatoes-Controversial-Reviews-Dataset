Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best star wars movies!\\nTook the star wars franchise to a different place instead of giving the fans traditional story they gave the story a twist.\\nThe movie has its issues but as a whole i loved how unpredictable it was!\\nHope the next one could please the fans who wanted some of the traditions and also continue with the new place star wars is headed.","true":true}
