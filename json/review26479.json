{"101487":158787,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Oh boy. I have visited this site a handful of times before today\\, but The Last Jedi made me sign up for Rotten Tomatoes and write a review because this is the closest I can get to writing a strongly worded letter to Rian Johnson.\\nFirst of all\\, it's not all bad. There were moments I genuinely loved but sadly most of them I loved because of how much I love Star Wars\\, not because how good the scenes were. The opening scene was striking and in my opinion\\, it was the best edited scene in the movie. But the following scenes did so much disservice to Poe's established character\\, taking only one facet of his personality\\, his rashness\\, and making it his only trait. He's not even the one who got the short end of the stick in terms of character development. This movie ruined the character arcs of all the new characters introduced in this trilogy\\, especially Rey.\\nI don't even know who Rey is anymore. She is not as smart as the girl who managed to survive in Jakku where she was left as a child. It really doesn't seem that she doesn't care for Finn as much as she did in The Force Awakens\\, where she fought Kylo Ren and ran towards Finn the moment she beat Kylo. For some reason\\, Kylo is much more important to her now even after the revelation the connection between them turning out to be Snoke's manipulation. She lashes out to Luke the moment she learns that Luke thought of killing Kylo before he caused too much harm (which\\, honestly\\, he should've done it) but never questions why Kylo murdered the other children in the temple\\, which brings me to my other point.\\nIf I have to sit through another three hours of Kylo Ren\\, a murderer\\, a thirty-year-old fascist who by the end of The Last Jedi starts making people call him \\\"Supreme Leader\\\" treated as a poor helpless manipulated child\\, I'm going to puke. Honestly? Writers should be suspended from writing any kind of \\\"grey morality\\\" until further notice. A mass murderer who serves as a right-hand man for a fascist is not \\\"morally grey\\\"\\, he is downright evil. Nothing at this point can redeem him in my eyes. Even if his actions were not reprehensible\\, I still wouldn't want to see him redeemed because I do not like him one bit. His writing is conflicting\\, he is not a compelling villain\\, and he is annoying. Taking all his agency to infantilize him and lay the blame of all the murder he did to literally everyone else in the Star Wars universe is not going to change that so Rian Johnson should stop wasting my time showing me scenes of Kylo Ren while there are so many wonderful characters\\, like Finn.\\nFinn's writing didn't strike me as especially terrible\\, as much as other characters\\, I'm glad that he didn't spend most of the movie in a coma\\, but I have genuine problems with how other characters are treating him. I think his initial interaction with Rose could have been much more impactful. Especially since Rian decided that there should be a romantic subplot there that is definitely not a response to fans thinking Finn and Poe are a cute couple. And I physically winced at the scene where he and Rose were forced to kneel in front of Hux\\, and getting slapped by him. It was very uncalled for and\\, all the imagery surrounding the First Order considered\\, very distasteful. \\nThe one thread that still binds me to Star Wars after this dumpster fire was that I finally got to see Princess Leia use the force\\, after all these years of subtle hints. It was a very important scene for me and I love Princess Leia and I love Carrie Fisher with all my heart. And also I think Poe Dameron should be the one who finally does Kylo in\\, after which Leia's force ghost gives him a peck on his cheek and calls him his son. Love me a chosen family trope. Bloodlines are overrated\\, especially in this franchise.\\nThis doesn't even cover all the inconsistencies and plot holes in The Last Jedi\\, but its already very long and I'm pretty sure a lot of people are already talking about them too. But I definitely feel better after writing this\\, I just hope that they hire Taika Watiti for episode 9. Or at least bring J.J Abrams back. Hell\\, TFA was not perfect\\, but it was not... like this.","true":true}
