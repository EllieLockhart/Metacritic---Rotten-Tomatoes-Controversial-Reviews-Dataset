Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked a lot about it. The main thing I disliked was Rose.\\nAlso\\, to the people complaining about Rey's parents apparently not being important people whatsoever: I'm pretty sure it's a fake out\\, and that Kylo was just lying to Rey when he said that. I could be wrong\\, but that's my thoughts anyway.","true":true}
