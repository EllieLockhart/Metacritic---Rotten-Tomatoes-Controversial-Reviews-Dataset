The way the new characters are executed makes them the least likable characters in the entire series\\, not only that\\, most of them are killed and forgotten right after the fact. By the time the game ends\\, you feel like the whole journey that was set up from the beginning was pointless\\, because there is absolutely no resolution to the plot.\rDon't waste your time and money on this. If you do want to experience this game\\, I suggest just watching a playthrough because almost half of this game is straight up filler.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
