Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you don't think during movies then this is the movie for you. I usually think after I see a movie and if you really think about it. The plot absolutely doesn't make any sense. Hopefully\\, They will clear things up in episode 9 but I doubt it.","true":true}
