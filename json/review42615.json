Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was bad on so many levels.  Let's begin with its connection to Star Wars or rather\\, the lack of connection with the source material.  It's as if Rian Johnson didn't care at all about the rich amount of material in the Star Wars universe and just wrote a generic sci-fi piece.  Every character was reinvented to the point of being almost unrecognizable.  This movie was such a divergence from the plotlines that had developed before that it felt like an alternate reality.\\n\\nStar Wars aside\\, the movie failed on so many levels.  The plot was contrived\\, dull\\, and nonsensical with undeveloped points.  No Star Wars movie had ever been boring but this approached that level.\\n\\nSometimes you have to watch a movie multiple times to appreciate or understand a movie's intentions.  So I did watch The Last Jedi multiple times and it's still a bad movie.  I will even rate it as the second worst Star Wars movie with only The Phantom Menace being worse.","true":true}
