Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There's a lot of hate around this movie from Star Wars fans. I'm a Star Wars fun\\, not a super fan who can name even the characters who have been on screen for one second but I know a decent amount of lore and such. There is plenty this movie does horrible\\, but there's also a lot of fun to this movie. Seeing Luke again is fun even if he's not the same Luke from episode 6. Watching kylo attempt to step out of Vader's shadow was great. Then there's the entire casino section\\, poorly paced\\, bad acting\\, bad story. The ending with rose isn't great either. I don't think this movie deserves the hate it gets but I also don't think it's a masterpiece","true":true}
