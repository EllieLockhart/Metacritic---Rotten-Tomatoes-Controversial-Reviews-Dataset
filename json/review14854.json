Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I honestly didn\u2019t know what to think after the late night premiere\\, after watching it the second time I enjoyed the film more. Granted there are some flaws\\, didn\u2019t like how quickly Snoke was killed \\, no back story of him\\,Rey\u2019s parents didn\u2019t live up to the hype\\, but it\u2019s Star Wars 2017\\, not 1977\\, there will never be another Empire Strikes Back\\,there\u2019s too much access to information\\, Ground yourself and enjoy it have fun. May the Force Be with You...","true":true}
