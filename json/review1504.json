Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a huge Star Wars fan I thought the movie was entertaining\\, had unexpected twists\\, but left me disappointed.\\nSPOILERS\\n1) Why didn't Admiral Holdo tell Poe and the remaining members of the Resistance about the escape plan? Unless she was working undercover for Snoke there was absolutely no reason to REFUSE to explain their plan and the whole mutiny scene and casino scene should have been ignored.\\n\\n2) Are you telling me that Luke Skywalker the guy that brought Darth Vader back into the light would try to kill his own nephew in his sleep just because of a vision he had? How was he consumed by fear at his level of wisdom and experience? Did he not tell Han and Leia that he tried to kill their son? Maybe Kylo tried to convince his parents that Luke tried to kill him and ended up hating them for not believing him thus turning to Snoke.\\n\\n3) Why did Luke leave a map for R2D2 if he wanted to close everyone off and die on the island?\\n\\n3)Who is Snoke and what did he do? He is the deadliest\\, skilled\\, manipulative villain in the Star Wars universe but we know nothing about him and is killed off like nothing.\\n\\nThis movie could have been so much more but it is going in a different direction now.","true":true}
