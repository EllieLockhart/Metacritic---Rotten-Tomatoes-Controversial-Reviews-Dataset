Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible film. Zero story telling or world building\\, and instead is littered with social justice warrior political messaging. Men are completely emasculated during the entire film\\, way too much forced humor\\, and Rose is worse than Jar Jar. And the treatment pf Luke's character is downright criminal. Flatliners was a better film than this. 0\/10","true":true}
