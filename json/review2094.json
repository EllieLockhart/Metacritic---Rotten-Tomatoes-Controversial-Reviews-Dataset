Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As the young Martin McFly would say \\\"Guess you guys aren't ready for that yet\\\". This film shows the true power of the force\\, in the prequels the Jedi were weak and naive. However\\, it seems that many fans have not liked this. Rian Johnson did very good work and showed new things\\, but I think he should leave star wars\\, it's a dangerous place. It seems that the only stories in which people might be happy are those that take place in the times of the original trilogy","true":true}
