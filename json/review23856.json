Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Made me sad. So many plot holes\\, and threw away all of the lore set up before it. For some reason the First Order has taken over the entire Galaxy? What is the point of episode 6?\\n\\nFin's plot was not needed\\, Rose is worse than Jar Jar.","true":true}
