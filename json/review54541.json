Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a lifelong fan of Star Wars since I saw Episode 4: A New Hope as a child. I've waited my whole adult life to see Luke\\, Han and Leia to return to the screen. I wanted to love The Last Jedi. But it's probably the worst film I've EVER seen in a cinema. It's complete garbage and should be consigned to the dustbin of history. To paraphrase Obi Wan Kenobi\\, \\\"this is not the film you're looking for\\\". It really shouldn't have been that hard to create good movies with the material the previous films left Disney with. But they've managed to destroy one of the greatest sagas in cinema history. There are so many things wrong with this film on almost every level... Other reviewers have covered this so I won't repeat them. For me these new films are past saving. Oh except The Last Jedi was visually stunning... that I can give them. But story? Characters that are well written you care about? Drama and suspense? A universe consistent within its own rules? (don't even get me started on bombs dropping through space as though from the effects of gravity - WHICH ISN'T THERE!) All missing\\, I couldn't find them anywhere. I don't want to watch any more of this rubbish. I'm amazed I even got to the end of the film without walking out. I can only think it was shock. Kathleen Kennedy and the current team should all be sacked and replaced with people who understand Star Wars and actually know what a good story looks\\, sounds and feels like. And if you're reading this and thinking I'm just bitter because it's got female characters or some other nonsense\\, don't believe the garbage the Disney damage limitation machine is spouting out. Princess Leia was awesome in the original films\\, good female characters are great\\, bring them on. But make them well written\\, make me care about them. This is just a really\\, really\\, really  bad film.  RIP Star Wars.","true":true}
