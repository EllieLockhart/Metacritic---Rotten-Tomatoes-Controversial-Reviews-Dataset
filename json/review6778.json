Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't listen to the salty fan boys who can't accept change. This Star Wars movie has the perfect blend of new and old\\, with a few very tasteful nods to the originals\\, but plenty of originality\\, something that the force awakens may have struggled with according to some. This movie plays out much like a comic book\\, and I mean that very endearingly.","true":true}
