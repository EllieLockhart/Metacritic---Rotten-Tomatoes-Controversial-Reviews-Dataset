Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was super disappointed with this last Star Wars installment. It was one of the most un-star wars feel of any of the previous films. Nothing against the actors at all it's totally the script and how they are trying to adapt what was once a classic into new generation BS. \\n\\nFirst of all the island scenes with Luke Skywalker was so boring and useless. What was once a great warrior becomes a Jedi recluse. \\n\\nThe whole GPS tracking thing didn't make any sense at all. Sometimes small ship can evade tracking with Star Trek invisible cloaking and sometimes they can't. It was too overboard even for Star Wars \\n\\nThe Bad Guys were like little girls gone are the days of real bad guys. A lot of the dialogue was a joke. \\n\\nBesides a few fighting scenes I feel like most of the film was talking about nothing. Gone are the day of real storylines like empire strikes back. \\n\\nI could go on and on but had enough of Star Wars. I'm going to the dark side and joining Star Trek. I don't think I'll ever take my entire family to Star Wars Premiere again!","true":true}
