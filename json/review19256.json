Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's not as bad as people say\\, but it's not good. It deserves credit for trying a new story instead of rehashing the same plot like The Force Awakens did. But\\, sometimes trying something new doesn't work and this one really doesn't. It's better than the worst of the prequels though\\, so there's that.","true":true}
