Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TOXIC FEMINISM\\, S.J.W. and ROSE\\, the OXYMORON who saves the animals for one day but NOT the children?.... STAR WARS is destroyed by the EVIL EMPIRE of left wing\\, pink\\, communist\\, social Marxist fascism! You may have won the battle\\, Kathleen Kreepy Kennedy (K.K.K.).......
