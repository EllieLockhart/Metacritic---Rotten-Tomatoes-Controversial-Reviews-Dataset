Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Beautiful but very bad movie. Such a waste of opportunity to be one of the best Star Wars movie ever. Poor characters with motivations that doesn't make sense and no respect to characters people loved and grew up with. My second biggest disappointment after BvS.","true":true}
