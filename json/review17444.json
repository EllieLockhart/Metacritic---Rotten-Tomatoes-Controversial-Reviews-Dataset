Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i saw this in theatres and thought it was poorly made with bad story telling bad character development very weak environment awareness  and a waste of great characters. when i saw it on dvd everything above was true and then some rian johnson is a baad choice for any fantasy film and has possibly ruined the franchise in one fell swoop","true":true}
