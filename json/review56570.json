Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a horrific mess that is extremely inconsistent with the Star Wars universe and mythos. It's like having a jigsaw puzzle that comes with a deformed piece that just doesn't fit. Granted\\, the movie is a very 'pretty' puzzle piece with all its special effects and colorful explosions. But no matter how you twist or rotate it\\, no matter how much you pound on it with your fist\\, it just doesn't fit into place with the other pieces\/movies. I'm perplexed by all the so-called expert critics the loved it because it was \\\"new and different\\\". Different doesn't automatically equal good. Yes\\, Rian Johnson took a risk. But that also doesn't mean it's automatically successful. That's why it's called a 'risk'. Most of the time you fall flat on your face...like this movie.\\n\\nNow let's meet the characters: \\nREY: \\\"Hi\\, I'm Mary Sue. I'm an overpowered\\, invincible god that never fails at anything...ever. No training or character development necessary. Cry\\, sob\\, I just want someone to show me my place in all this.\\\" \\nKYLO: \\\"Hi\\, you can call me Ben. I was trained by Jedi Master Luke Skywalker and the seemingly powerful Snoke. But I still lost a lightsaber battle to a rookie with no training who just picked up a lightsaber for the very first time.\\\" \\nPOE: \\\"Hi\\, I'm the cool white male on the team. That's why I had to get neutered by the SJWs.\\\" \\nFinn: \\\"Hi\\, I'm Token. I did nothing to advance the storyline of this film\\, nothing at all.\\\" \\nRose: \\\"Do you miss Jar Jar yet?\\\" \\nSNOKE: \\\"I'm not saying anything about myself! Nothing!\\\" \\nLUKE: \\\"You all know me. I'm the guy that never gave up on my dad\\, Darth Vader\\, because I sensed a glimmer of light still in him. But when I sensed a little darkness in my nephew\\, Ben\\, I figured I would just kill him in his sleep.\\\"","true":true}
