Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson has truly done a remarkable job with the next chapter in the Star Wars saga. Mark Hamill once demonstrates his incredible acting prowess in this film and and the film delivers many unexpected but satisfying moments resulting a fresh yet familiar story that truly entertains from begining to end.","true":true}
