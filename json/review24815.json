Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My (adult) daughter said it best: Lucas's movies were the real Star Wars. This is all fan fiction. Really quite terrible fan fiction when it comes to how Luke and the whole mythology of the Jedi are mistreated. The best parts of the movie are when Rey and what's-his-name-from-Girls are on the screen. They are good. The movie is not. Too long\\, too many contrived narrow escapes. Too much effort to hide the thinness of it all with explosions. And even those elements are interwoven with Lucas ripoffs. \\\"Look a casino with weird aliens!\\\" \\\"Look\\, an absurdly big weapon we can only destroy by going down the center of it!\\\" Whatever. I think I'll watch the next installment on Netflix or something.","true":true}
