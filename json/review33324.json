Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Surprised that this has been so divisive. I've seen it three times and it gets better every time. I personally like this film more than Force Awakens! I'm glad to see some new life breathed into the franchise\\, not just another rehash. The good far outweighed the bad. Sure\\, there were moments like Super-Leia and the Canto Bight chase sequence. But the superb character development\\, dire stakes\\, unexpected turns and fascinating themes shine much brighter than the faults.","true":true}
