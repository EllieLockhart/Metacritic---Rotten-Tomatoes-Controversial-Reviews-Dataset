Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everything I was excited for that TFA set up was totally dismissed as if it didn't matter. 2 years of countless fan theories and speculation\\, all for nothing. In addition\\, the movie was extremely political which frustrated me to no end. And don't get me started on the ridiculous slapstick humor and bad jokes. I'm left wondering what they'll do for episode 9. There's no mystery\\, no plot momentum\\, nothing that leaves me wanting to find out what happens next. Truly disappointed.","true":true}
