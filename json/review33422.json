Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Tbh i just expect better from lucasfilm\/disney the acting and overall production are stellar\\, but the writing was very un star wars and lacking in just about every way.","true":true}
