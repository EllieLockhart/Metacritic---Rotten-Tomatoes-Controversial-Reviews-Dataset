Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed the movie with a few caveats.\\nToo many cutsie pie creatures added just to sell toys\\, the side quest was a waste of time\\, and the Mary Poppins flight looked terrible.\\nI personally think that hatred for this movie is from younger rabid fanboy types who weren't born when Star Wars was first released (and therefore enjoyed the copycat \\\"Force Awakens\\\") and have spent the last year living in their parents basements devoting all their time to theorizing origin stories. \\nI was delighted that the silly fan theories were subverted. Just tell me a new story. I was pleased that Characters had evolved... it's been decades.","true":true}
