Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's obvious that movie is mishit in many ways.Serions mishit that cause loss of beloved one after long life together\\, filled with love and magic.Like something that shoud live forever just died. But\\, what bothers me equal\\, if not even more\\, is  obvious unrealistic and insincere (conditioned?) critics and reviews\\, and with this movie it becomes absurd.So absurd that\\, if nothing else\\, lighten up one bitter truth - do critic agregators and movie reviewers have any validity these days??","true":true}
