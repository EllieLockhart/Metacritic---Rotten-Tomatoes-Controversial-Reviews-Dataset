The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game is better than the first one.  Joel was a bad person\\, Ellie is a bad person\\, and (shockingly) Abby is a bad person.  You can try to convince yourself that \\\"That's just the world they live in\\, they do these things to survive\\\"\\, but you're just deluding yourself.  When you look at both the original and Part II as one story\\, you carry out horrific acts in the name of your own self interest\\, with Joel probably being the worst of the three.  This game isn't about Joel\\, but given the community response\\, you'd swear that you spend more than 90 seconds playing as him.\rNaughty Dog have given the player a chance to look at the idea of actions and consequences.  You pulled a trigger in 2013\\, and the effect of that has finally come to fruition\\, but not as you would have liked.  Just like Joel massacring a hospital full of people\\, Ellie's actions in Seattle had consequences\\, offered from the perspective that we as players rarely ever think about.  The first couple of hours playing as Abby were frustrating\\, but the moment that sealed her story as it's own troubled journey was when you decide to go back for Yara and Lev.  She wasn't acting out of the goodness of her heart\\, but trying to prove to herself that she was a good person\\, it was a self-serving act.  Just like Joel \\\"saving\\\" Ellie\\, just like Ellie's acts of vengeance.  By the end of this game\\, I wanted either both Ellie and Abby to live or both to die\\, because the pitiable state that their respective journeys leave them in doesn't make you feel like the hero you want to be at the end of a 30 hour game.  You should feel the weight of your actions.\rJust to comment\\, I liked Joel\\, with every second of screen time in this game\\, he was allowed to grow\\, which is why he had to die.  No matter how much you grow\\, the sins of the past have a way of catching up to you\\, it's just fortunate that he had enough of an impact on Ellie to keep her from following the same path that he took.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
