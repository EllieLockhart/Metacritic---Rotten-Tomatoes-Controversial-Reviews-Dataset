Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"rian johnson made a basically ruined star wars with this film\\, I will never watch a another star wars that is directed by rian johnson! So sad that he killed every single interesting plot point of the force awakens. who are reys parents? nobody! who is snoke? who cares hes dead! somehow luke became a crazy old man because his nephew turned bad even though hes his dad is darth vader!","true":true}
