Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sorry for my bad english but i'm not mother tongue. For my The last Jedi is the worst Star Wars movie ever... it seems a parody of a Star Wars movie: the comicality seems forced and used for making fun of the olds funs who read Star wars like an epic saga. (in the original trilogy there was comicality scenes but it was contextualized... for example Han's comic arrogance it's bound at the love complicity with Leia). The mithology and the epic tone of Star Wars it's completely vanish and the history of the saga and all the characters are trivialize. Without Luke Skywalkers the entire saga have no more sense ( Star Wars was the story of Luke and his father... and now?) so if we take all the film together there isn't no more moral and cohesion\\n.\\nP.s.The Last Jedi's petty philosophy of \\\"let the past die\\\" \\,that is simply delete the past\\, hurts me like fan and like man (i'm study history at Universtity)... so for me it's very hard to say how much i'm disappointed from this movie... maybe i was wrong and I had too high expectations from Star Wars that i belived a modern epic opera like Odyssey or The Lords Of Rings and in reality it's simply a cinecomic without too many pretensions... sorry","true":true}
