Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had a lot of potential\\, however\\, to many things were forced. There was an unnecessary\/ poorly written side plot\\, there was forced love\/romance scenes that made no sense\\, added nonsense that doesn't really follow Star Wars cannon (you'll know what I'm talking about when you watch it)\\, and just overall dialogue and characters that made the film annoying. There were great parts to the film that were visually amazing\\, parts with great dialogue\\, and other rid bits here and there that went over well. However\\, it seemed like they were trying to put to much into the film\\, both character\\, world building\\, and Disney's own little touches made this film come out as a dissatisfaction for many Star Wars fans. While there is truth to the whole \\\"Star Wars fans will never be happy\\\"\\, I do. It believe it entirely. There are films that go over well with start Wars fans like Episode 3\\, ANH\\, Rogue 1\\, and even the Han Solo movie. This film however\\, has left me with distrust in the ability of current writers to produce a film that bodes well with the years of cannon\\, films\\, and general media available in the world of Star Wars.","true":true}
