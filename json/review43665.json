Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was Rian's \\\"screw you\\\" to JJ Abrams... He essentially undid everything that was previously set up in the Force Awakens. Where The Force Awakens was the perfect reboot to help us forget about the prequels\\, The Last Jedi is a big middle finger to every Star Wars fan. As a standalone movie\\, it was great\\, but it was NOT a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
