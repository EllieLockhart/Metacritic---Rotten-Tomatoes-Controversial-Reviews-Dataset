Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I honestly do not understand the bad reviews.  it is like they watched a different movie.  The Last Jedi is worthy of the Star Wars name and Rian Johnson did a spectacular job of improving upon the foundation built in The Force Awakens.  I am not a fan of Episodes 1-III\\, but I am a big fan of this Episode VIII.","true":true}
