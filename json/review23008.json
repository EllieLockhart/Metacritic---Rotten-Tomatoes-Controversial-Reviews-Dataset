Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lots of risks were taken in The Last Jedi and it pays off! Great addition to the Star Wars saga! Luke may be a broken jedi\\, but when the time comes... He will do what needs to be done to help his friends and sister! \\n\\nThe weakest part was the casino stuff. Thankfully it doesnt last that long! \\n\\nThe best part\\, IMO\\, was Luke's entire arc. Unexpected but so satisfying!","true":true}
