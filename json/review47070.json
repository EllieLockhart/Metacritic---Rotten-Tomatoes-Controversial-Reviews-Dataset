Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a great movie and a very unexpected turn for this new series! Very well acted compared to the original and prequel trilogies; amazing effects (as predicted); and a suspenseful and thoughtful story. I am dumbfounded as to a sizable sample size of Star Wars fans. No\\, this movie does not spoon-feed you background stories. This is similar to the original trilogy: we didn\u2019t know anything about Obi Wan\u2019s family or the Emperor\u2019s past or much of anything at all about Yoda. And if you want Luke to be a perfect and all powerful light saber user\\, go play a video game and control his every move. These characters have so much more depth\/internal conflict than the original good vs evil original trilogy. ","true":true}
