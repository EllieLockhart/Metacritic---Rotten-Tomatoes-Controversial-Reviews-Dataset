Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It really doesn't go the way you think and that's amazing! The movie faults in one act simply being not as exciting as the rest\\, a couple out-of-place jokes\\, and one antagonist not ever making smart decisions. Everything else is one fun and incredibly thrilling ride that puts your favorite characters through some tough decision making and developments. The movie left me in wonder and excitement for what's to come in the next film of the trilogy.","true":true}
