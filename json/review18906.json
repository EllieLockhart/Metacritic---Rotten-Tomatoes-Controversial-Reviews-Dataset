Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a spit in the face of the Star Wars universe\\, lore\\, and the characters we've come to love. It makes the prequels look good. All the magic is gone. It just looks like your average\\, most basic\\, fast and furious-esque action \\\"blockbuster\\\". The forced diversity is also pretty cringe-worthy.","true":true}
