Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The critics review that this movie has emotion rich content which fans like to see is astounding. \\n\\nThe last jedi is a good stand alone movie but not as part 8 of a saga apaning over 30 years .\\n\\nMovie is optically and acoustically extremely beautiful but just doesnt fit in the jig zaw puzzle of the skywalker saga. \\n\\nSo sad on this lost oppourtunity to close the skywalker saga with some respect and decency.","true":true}
