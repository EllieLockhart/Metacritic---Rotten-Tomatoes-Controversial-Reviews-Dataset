Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"really surprised to see the lower audience rating for this movie. I absolutely loved it! Had everything I wanted in a Star Wars movie without the need of copying Empire's storyline. Everyone I saw it with loved it\\, too! So I was clearly not alone. I'll be seeing this one again!","true":true}
