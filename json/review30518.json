Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Shortchanges iconic characters from the original trilogy\\, while not giving us new three dimensional characters to care about. Tons of unanswered questions left over from The Force Awakens\\, and several plot points are just silly\/go nowhere. A real misfire that has left a bad taste in my mouth for Star Wars going forward.","true":true}
