Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Vaya forma de destrozar una pel\u00edcula de star wars\\, SPOILERS.\\n SUPERGIRL volando por el espacio exterior\\, Snoke muriendo de una forma rapida\\, sin contar nada de el\\, destrozando un personaje que parecia super poderoso... lo peor de todo la historia... que pena... con el potencial que tiene este universo y las cagadas que hacen.... verla en casa Gratis\\, no merece la pena ni pagar por cable por verla...","true":false}
