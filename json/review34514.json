Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back with a great mix of action\\, humour and nostalgia.  Certain elements may not have the conclusion that some fans were looking for but for me that makes it all the more intriguing.  I do feel that a lot of people will always find fault in a new Star Wars movie no matter what happens so just ignore a lot of the negative comments and enjoy the film as it's own spectacle...because it is extremely entertaining and passes the baton on nicely to the new generation of characters.","true":true}
