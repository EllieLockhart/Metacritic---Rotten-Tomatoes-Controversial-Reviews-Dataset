Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i really liked it!  It wasn't without it's flaws but it does fit very well into the canon of star wars.  I think any and all overall judgement should be held off until the next movie is out - it's not a stand alone - its 1 part of a 9 part story!","true":true}
