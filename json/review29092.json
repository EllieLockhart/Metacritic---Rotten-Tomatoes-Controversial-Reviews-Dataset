Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really not sure what's up with Star Wars. Disney may be to blame\\, not sure. Either way\\, I actually fell asleep in the theater and when I watched the bluray I know why. It's kinda boring.","true":true}
