Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie could have been soo much better. Any movie could be really but Last Jedi was a disgrace and kind of ruined my hope for the series future. Disney really needs to listen to the fans\\, they can't keep going like this. ?\\, Luke was ruined and wasted\\, Snoke wasted\\, Rey's backstory wasted\\, Kylo's character development wasted\\, FInn had no development\\, Fisher's exit wasted. THE ENTIRE THING WAS A POORLY WRITTEN WASTE!","true":true}
