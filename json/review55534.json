Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Never reviewed a movie until now. This movie pushed me to the point were i had to review & say my bit. Horrible\\, so disappointing. I wish all involved would just admit they got it wrong\\, instead of trying to defend this movie. So many upsetting moments throughout the story\\, I could of probaly excepted it\\, even princess Leia doing her super man with no questions asked\\, but what they did with Luke's character\\, absolutely shattering. Can't see myself making any effort to see another star wars flick\\, yes that's how bad this was.o","true":true}
