Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"total the worst Star Wars Ever! The script is so bad that my 8 years son was laughing. Defo Disney pay for Rotten Website as I cannot believe that critics like it .","true":true}
