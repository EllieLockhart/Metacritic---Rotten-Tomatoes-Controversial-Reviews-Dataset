Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Felt every minute of this boring long tedious movie. Two people fell asleep next to me at a 4pm matinee. Awful movie\\, huge disappointment. Go see Daddys home 2","true":true}
