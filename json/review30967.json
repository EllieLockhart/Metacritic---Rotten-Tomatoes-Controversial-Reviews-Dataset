Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointing\\, a total waste of original characters.\\nI understand this is because they want to erase all George Lucas originals and make a new franchise and make hollow stories and with no relevance at all.\\nPerhaps my last starwars movie","true":true}
