Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Refreshing\\, that's for sure! It's not perfect\\, but it's easily the best since Return of the Jedi. Keeps you guessing\\, and answers some questions you have in ways you don't expect. Some questions get no answer\\, but there's always the next movie. I understand people not liking the answers they get\\, but you can't fault the movie for not playing out the way you anticipated. They're telling a dark story (with plenty of comic relief)\\, a little clunky at times\\, but for the most part it flows smoothly. Main plot has been labeled by some as just a low speed chase\\, but you need to realize the stakes involved. The entirety of the rebellion has dwindled to a dismal number of people and they are all in the crosshairs.","true":true}
