Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's the worst Star Wars movie to date; with a couple of memorable moments and too much progressive agenda. Sexual diversity\\, feminism\\, minorities\\, are things that are appreciated when they are natural in history\\, not when they put on shoehorns. Writers do not understand the universe of star wars\\, jedi and \/ or the force. If it were a movie outside of that universe it could have 3 stars; but in the universe of star wars it's a crap.","true":true}
