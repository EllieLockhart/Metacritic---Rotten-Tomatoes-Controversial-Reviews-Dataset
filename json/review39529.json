Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was a major disappointment. From the very first scene this movies dialog and acting is almost unwatchable. The plot is rambling and incoherent. There are no less than 6 opportunities to end this movie on a high note that fizzle into unsatisfying forced jeopardy. At no time did I feel any connection or involvement with any of the characters. The constant parade of this year's action figures was obvious and cheapen the film. Overall I regret seeing it. I can't believe this is in the same universe as rouge one.","true":true}
