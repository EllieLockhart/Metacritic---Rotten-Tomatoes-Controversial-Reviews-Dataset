We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Dont trust the negative reviews\\,the narrative of this game is good\\,little kids are mad about Joels Death and how did this happened.Haters of this game is saying that Joel will not tell to those guys his name-First of all when Joel came to them Abby already know that it is killer of her father\\,cause while Tommy and Joel where resqueing Abby\\,Tommy said to Abby that his name is Tommy and it is my brother Joel\\,and thats it Abby is already know that is Joel.Second-Why did he told his name to the company of unknown people-Cause theve saved his life and after 5 year pause of crimes and violence.Ok lets talk about the plot\\,in opnion it is Narrative Masterpice\\,all chacters are like live persons with own psyche and motivations\\,the game is divided into a two strory lines Ellies story line and Abbys story line\\,and what can i say\\,Ellies Story line is like Uncharted 4 Ellie sacrifice all her for friends for revenge like Nathan Drake sacrifices everything for a treasure\\,and Abbys story line is like a Last of Us Part 1 Abby meet two strangers they resqued het and she resqued them\\,but after the night with Owen she sees a dream where she sees them died\\,and she decides to help them\\,and in the end of abbys soryline comes best level of the game Seraphites Island\\,and when WLF soliders comes to an island and begin a war with seraphits the island turns into mess and chaotic place\\,so i love this level.After Abbys storyline she finds Owen dead with Mel and she want to kill the killers of her friends she find out the theater and revenge Ellie for her friends.And waht can i say about ending Ellie coming to Santa Barbara to stop Flashbacks Where Joel always dies ( Read for text book while u are in Santa Barbara and ull understand what im taking about) and when Ellie overcome Abby and nearly kill Abby she sees Joel alive playing on his guitar and she understands that revenge is ended and she wins\\,but ull ask to me why didnt she kill Abby because she dont to became a monster that killed mother(Abby) in front of daughter (Lev).And when Ellie sees last flashback with Joel one day before his death where she forgives him for accident in the Salt Lake City Fireflies Hospital and we see that Joel is happy for his forgivnes and after it we see that Joel will be not forgotten.\rGameplay is super interesting and action elements are breathtaking\\,weapon customization\\,stels elements and character animation is perfect.It is a good exapmle of perfect Gameplay.\rGraphics is perfect i think dont need to say anything.\rLevel Desing is super cool\\,a lot of covers and safe rooms where u can rest a bit after battle and u can also collect some resurses on level and craft some cool stuff while u are in battle.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
