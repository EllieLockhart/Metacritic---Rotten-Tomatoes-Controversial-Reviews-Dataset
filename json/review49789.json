Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yeah\\, there were bits that we really didn't need but it took us in a direction the stories have never explored. As bad as things seemed in Empire this took that further to show how good intentions and not listening lead to ruin. Lessons learned the hard way. We got to see ideas explored that we have never had on screen for SW which was great. One of my favorite parts was the fan theorists being wrong despite demanding the films do as they dream. I do wish certain things had been left as bonus material but otherwise it did great in building up these characters into something you feel for.","true":true}
