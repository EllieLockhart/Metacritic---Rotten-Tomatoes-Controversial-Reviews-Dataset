Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left this film disappointed and un-impressed. Rian Johnson was paid by Disney to make a very long Disney commercial. He did not treat the Star Wars saga story with any kind of respect. He just made up new characters and throws out fundamental characters that have been around since the 70s. What a disrespect. What a let down. I honestly cant believe they dropped the ball on this. JJ ABRAMS IS YOUR ONLY HOPE\\, Disney.","true":true}
