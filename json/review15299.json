Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I like this movie. So what? I thought the visuals were stunning and the film was rich in creativity. The characters drive the plot in an emotionally satisfying and (at one point\\, forced) thought provoking way\\, even when some arcs are vastly more important than others. Nostalgia is not a big player in this movie\\, which is a good thing because The Last Jedi has to stand on its own in a trilogy without taking direct references to previous installments. John Williams's score is phenomenal\\, as usual. Last\\, but not least\\, the twists in this movie were disappointing at first but I learned to accept them as this film is just a part of a broader story. All in all\\, yeah\\, I liked it. Let me enjoy things.","true":true}
