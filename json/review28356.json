Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Possible spoiler alert!\\n\\nMany people would likely see the audience score on this site and believe that the film is a failure\\, having isolated half of moviegoers. However\\, this is not the case\\, and actually reveals how successful the film really is.\\n\\nAudiences often complained that The Force Awakens was a retread of the original trilogy. To an extent this is true. However many fail to recognize the necessity of such a move. The filmmakers were introducing new characters to a familiar universe. It would be a tall order to deliver both a new set of characters and an unfamiliar plot and consider it related to Star Wars. The (awful) Prequels got away with it simply because they had several characters audiences were familiar with to keep it within the Star Wars universe.\\n\\nNow this film is not at all a retread. It is wholly new. And fans are even more divided over it\\, which is expected and actually it's a very good thing. People are not sure how to feel. And those most angry with the film believe they have every right to be angry. Although they couldn't be more wrong.\\n\\nYou see\\, most of the naysayers have been waiting two years for the \\\"questions raised by Force Awakens\\\" to be answered. The most popular being \\\"Who is Snoke?\\\" followed by \\\"Is Poe gay?\\\" These and other many \\\"pressing\\\" questions preyed on their minds for two years\\, resulting in a barrage of fan theory videos and blogs. Thanks to the Prequels\\, audiences have come to expect a small universe of familiar names and characters\\, and they expected it to get even smaller with this film.\\n\\nHowever\\, upon analysis\\, it becomes clear that The Force Awakens only truly promised two questions to be answered in the next film: \\\"Who are\/were Rey's parents? and \\\"What happened between Ben and Luke at the Jedi academy?\\\" And Last Jedi answers these questions. But it seems that even then fans did not accept the answers\\, which begs the question\\, if the film did attempt to answer your questions\\, would it ever satisfy you? Or would it most likely divide fans even further?\\n\\nInstead of making a small universe (and let's face it\\, Star Wars was a terribly small universe)\\, Last Jedi expands the Star Wars universe beyond Kenobis\\, Skywalkers... the whole point of the film appears to be that the Force is much more than \\\"epic\\\" lightsaber battles and telekinetic powers to move objects. We see new Force powers\\, we get new characters and locations\\, and film manages to also expand our concept of the war itself\\, the effects upon the downtrodden\\, the greed of war profiteering... the Last Jedi is filled with amazing concepts that only get richer upon discussion.\\n\\nThe sequel trilogy finds it home comfortably next to the original trilogy. To me\\, these five films are all the best Star Wars they can be. Star Wars (1977)\\, The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\\, Return of the Jedi (1983)\\, The Force Awakens (2015)\\, and now The Last Jedi (2017) are equals in my book.\\n\\nHighly recommended!","true":true}
