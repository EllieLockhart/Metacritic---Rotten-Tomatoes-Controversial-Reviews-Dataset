Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I LOVED  this movie! It was fast paced and lived up to the hype! Carry Fisher gave the best performance of her life. Mark Hamil was also completely ON for this one. He looked depressed near the beginning\\, and enigmatic and in control in the final battle. Kylo Ren and Rey have CHEMISTRY! They really do! It is undeniable. You want them together even if they have to destroy the universe\\, you just want them together.   Fynn was back\\, large and in charge in his own way. The budding relationship between he and Rose is heartwarming. And well-acted.   Lastly the Porgs! OMGosh! I want one! If this Movie had come out a month ago\\, Porgs would be the Christmas \\\"It\\\" animal! In any form\\, stuffed\\, figures\\, whatever!","true":true}
