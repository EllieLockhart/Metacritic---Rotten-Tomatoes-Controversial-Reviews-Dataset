Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If I saw Rian Johnson walking across the street\\, I'd probably throw some rotten tomatoes at him. I heard this guy was a big fan of the star wars franchise\\, but after watching the movie\\, there is no way this is true. Our childhood heroes are now losers. New characters are pretty much useless\\, with the exception of Rey. Poe Daemon is boring and Fin is neither funny or exciting. If you take these two completely out of the saga it would probably make it better. It also has the most boring light saber duel of all time in the end of the movie. In a movie that is 2.5 hours long why would you not have Luke kicking some first order ass with his light saber? How can that hurt the movie? I just don't get it. And now I hear Rian Johnson is going to make a brand new star wars trilogy. Please Disney\\, pick somebody else\\, don't continue to ruin my favorite franchise!","true":true}
