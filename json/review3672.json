Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Betrayal of actual fans. Red meat for disinterested movie-goers looking for something pretty to watch or elitist critics who have decided it is imperative to insert their irrelevant political opinions into every single piece of art\\, regardless of whether or not they actually value the original art. Hardly any of the mysterious questions raised in The Force Awakens were answered. The ones that were were answered poorly. One of the subplots\\, which took up half the film\\, literally could have been entirely erased from the movie\\, and it would have made 0 difference to the plot. Overall\\, bad storytelling and an utter betrayal to fans of the original series. I rank it below every single Star Wars movie besides Episode 1 and 2. (And that's not saying much.)","true":true}
