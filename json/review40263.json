Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"This isn't going to go how you think\\\" is a great summation with this movie.  If you are fine with that\\, then you will greatly enjoy this movie.\\n\\nIf you are super invested in fan theories?  Well. You maybe need to write some fanfic instead.","true":true}
