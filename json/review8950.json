Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"fresh\\, unexpected\\, weird.\\nas i entered the cinema\\, i expected it to behave like the force awakens did with a new hope\\, but soon the directing and the way plot was behaving proved me wrong\\, and made me think that there's still plot for courage behind the cameras. i wouldn't have dared directing it this way\\, and that makes it special.","true":true}
