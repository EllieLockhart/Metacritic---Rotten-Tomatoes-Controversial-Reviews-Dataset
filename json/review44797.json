Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"True SW fan to the core. This entire New Trilogy is a bit disappointing. Always entertained by a SW film but Last Jedi has too many questions\\, flaws\\, plot holes. It be fine if They created a New Trilogy with no connection to the Original 6 saga films. This is why I cannot give this movie a high score.","true":true}
