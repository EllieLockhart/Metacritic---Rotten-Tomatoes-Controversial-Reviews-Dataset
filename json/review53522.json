Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hands down the worst Star Wars movie ever made. Trust Disney to screw Star Wars\\, don't know what they were thinking. To elaborate without spoilers is that everything is wrong\\, plot\/character development\/forced humor\/general direction etc you name it and this movie has issues. the only reason critics liked it is because its different. well i guess these critics are not true star wars fans. i mean Disney had a whole slew of titles\/story lines to take inspiration from and yet they screwed it up big time. this movie is even worse than the phantom menace and that is saying something.","true":true}
