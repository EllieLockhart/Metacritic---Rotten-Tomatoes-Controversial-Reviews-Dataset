Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The backstory between Kylo Ren and Rey is the ONLY redeeming portion of the movie. The film brings the Skywalker saga to a close with a completely out-of-character wimper from Luke Skywalker\\, and introduces random 'force abilities' by Luke and Leia\\, never seen before in canon\\, as a matter of seeming convenience. Various subplots provide little to no overall significant contribution to the story and seem forced. The film fails to generate the typical charisma of the the Lucas-era films and appears to cater toward future merchandising rather than good story-telling. Unless Disney can hit a home run with episode IX\\, I feel that this latest trilogy will go down in film history as even worse than the prequels.","true":true}
