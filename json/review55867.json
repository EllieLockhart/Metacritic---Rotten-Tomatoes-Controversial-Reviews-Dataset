Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rarely have I looked forward to a movie as much nor been as disappointed. As much as The Force Awakens was a rehash of the original\\, it did introduce us to new characters that we cared about and wanted to learn more about. Who\/what is Snoke? Who are Rey's parents? Who are Finn's parents? Who is Captain Phasma?  We got no answers\\, save one throwaway line about Rey's parentage that was about the most disappointing answer they could have given. Instead of developing the new characters that were introduced in TFA\\, Johnson instead introduced more new characters that were one dimensional and served little purpose to the plot.  The DJ character was a waste of Benicio's talent. Ditto for Laura Dern's character. In sum - far too long\\, zero character development and no answers to most of the questions posed in TFA. It was like he was flipping the bird to JJ Abrams and the fans.\\n\\nThe biggest disappointment was the treatment of Luke's character.  Now I know why Mark Hamill said he completely disagreed with everything Rian Johnson wrote. I cannot believe they gave Johnson a trilogy based upon this and I have been a big fan of Johnson's previous work.","true":true}
