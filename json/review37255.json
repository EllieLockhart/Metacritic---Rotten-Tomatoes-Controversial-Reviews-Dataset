Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The people upset are the ones attached the the happy-go-lucky\\, campy\\, unrealistic universe where the hairbrained scheme would always prevail over insurmountable odds. This totally changes the tune of Star Wars but makes you trust the universe in a way that \\\"putting on a stormtrooper outfit and escaping by the seat of your pants always wins\\\" never did. It's excellent writing and needs to be commended.","true":true}
