Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite popular belief there's actually a lot of scenes in this movie that are directly ripped off from the original trilogy. And shamelessly so. So\\, as far as mr Johnson's comments about it being a departure from the originals is a lie.\\nBeyond that this movie is objectively terrible. Any scene that was about to build tension and drama was cutt off by a bad throwaway joke. There is little to no character development. Instead of having a well established and explained a and b plot we get several incomplete c plots.  Every difficult moment our heroes encounter is solved by convenience. That is bad writing.\\n\\nThen the unforgivable happens\\, the complete and utter assassination of an original character\\, whose motives are so out of character its maddening to imagine the director was a \\\"fan\\\" of the originals.\\n\\nIt isnt good as a standalone movie\\, it isnt good as part of a trilogy\\,  and it retroactively devalues the originals. A good writer and director can subvert expectations without diminishing characters\\, story\\, plot\\, or insulting the audiences intelligence.  Rian Johnson is no such writer or director.\\n\\nAll flash and no substance.  I was severely disappointed. And as a disclaimer: I entered the theater without any preconceived fan theories or expectations. I entered excited and left....empty.","true":true}
