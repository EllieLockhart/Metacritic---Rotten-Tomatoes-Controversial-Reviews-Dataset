Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not a fanboy\\, but I've always enjoyed the franchise. This movie had a lot of visuals and fight scenes\\, but by far the weakest plot of any of the previous 7. Many parts were cheesy and some even cringy. It felt less like Star Wars and more like a random Disney\/Marvel movie. You could feel the things they were adding in just to sell toys. For a normal movie\\, I would give it 6\/10. For a Star Wars movie 1\/10.","true":true}
