Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was ok\\, but there was WAY too much stupid\\, unnecessary crap thrown in.  Between trying to sell merchandise and trying to please everyone\\, Disney is coming dangerously close to loosing the Star Wars fan base.","true":true}
