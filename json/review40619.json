Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst Star Wars movie of them all. Not just because it takes a massive crap on the franchise\\, but it has plot holes\\, timing issues\\, and is a carbon copy of The Empire Strikes Back. \\nWatch it to see how far the franchise has fallen\\, and see how big of a middle finger Rian Johnson gave to Lucas.","true":true}
