Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A poorly written film. It is clear that Johnson\\, like Abrams before him\\, has no knowledge of the lore of the Star Wars saga. Fan favorite characters are disrespected and killed off\\, while even new characters like Snoke and fan favorite Phasma are reduced to being pitiful characters killed off without any further character development. Little is explained\\, and what is explained isn't explained well. The film also fails to fix the issues from the previous film. Rey is still an overpowered Mary Sue\\, and Kylo Ren still acts like a moody emo teen. Overall\\, the film is a mess\\, with far too many side plots that needlessly drag on. It opens with a childish yo momma joke\\, and ends with a disappointing climax that rips off The Empire Strikes Back. I left the theater confused and disgusted\\, with more questions than answers. I had expected the film to better than it's predecessor\\, but instead it suffered from some of the same problems with some new ones thrown in. While I have little to say that is positive\\, however\\, I will say this: unlike Abrams\\, who pretty much ripped off the original film\\, Johnson actually tried to give us an original story. Yes\\, it wasn't a very good story\\, but it was an original story. While the film borrows partly from The Empire Strikes Back and\\, surpisingly\\, Return of the Jedi\\, it cannot be called a remake of either film. That alone is a significant improvement over The Force Awakens\\, and while I am disappointed with the results\\, I can at least respect Johnson's originality. For  my final verdict\\, I'd have to say that while it may satisfy kids or a casual fan\\, this is not a film for hardcore fans like me or those who want a good story. It's a popcorn flick\\, something to occupy your time when there is nothing better to do\\, but not something you'll want to see again and again.","true":true}
