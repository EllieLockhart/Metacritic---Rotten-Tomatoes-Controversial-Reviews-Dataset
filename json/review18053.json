{"101487":140811,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-01","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think this movie is the biggest disappointment of the year. Having grown up with the OT\\, I'm a long-time Star Wars fan\\, although not a fanatic\\, and I really enjoyed TFA\\, despite its flaws. I gave TLJ 1\/2 star for cinematography (although I felt there was too much CGI; JJ Abrams did a much better job mixing practical effects with CGI in TFA). I gave another 1\/2 star for the musical score and audio\\, and another 1\/2 star for the acting.\\n\\nUnfortunately\\, the plot and lack of consistency with Star Wars lore is what ruins this movie for me. There are tons of plotholes (summarized very well by many other reviewers) and ridiculous plot devices are employed repeatedly (too much deus ex machina and too many \\\"gotcha\\\" moments\\, just for the sake of trying to surprise the audience without them adding anything to the overall narrative). The main plot and subplots mostly go nowhere\\, leaving us with little interest in what happens in the next movie. The tone is often off (e.g.\\, the Canto Bight subplot) with comedy that was too 2017 or bordering on slapstick (e.g.\\, Luke throwing the lightsabre over his shoulder). The characters are either uninteresting (e.g.\\, Rose)\\, annoying (e.g.\\, Rose\\, Holdo)\\, poorly developed (e.g.\\, how does Rey become so powerful and proficient with minimal training?)\\, or inappropriately handled (e.g.\\, Finn\\, Poe\\, Snoke\\, and especially Luke; Mark Hamill was right to voice his concerns). There are few compelling character arcs. The new force abilities demonstrated are inconsistent with what we have seen in any of the preceding films and are\\, for the most part\\, ridiculous (e.g.\\, Leia flying through space\\, astral projection\\, force FaceTime\\, etc). Although I was not invested in any of the major fan theories leading up to the movie\\, I did find it annoying that many of the questions posed by TFA were either ignored or answered in a very underwhelming way. As many other reviewers have pointed out\\, why make a big deal of these questions only to discard or minimize them in the sequel? Also\\, the political messages (e.g.\\, anti-capitalism\\, animals rights\\, etc) did not need to be in there and added little to the overall narrative.\\n\\nLastly\\, I'm not a bot or a member of the alt-right. I have absolutely no problem with having female protagonists and an ethnically diverse cast. I can only hope that Disney and Lucasfilm are taking the audience feedback seriously. They had the perfect setup to make an awesome Star Wars movie that moved the story forward in a meaningful satisfying way\\, but they blew it. I know it's impossible to please everyone (especially some hard-core fans)\\, but there is a middle ground that I think would satisfy the majority of fans. I hope the next movie is more of a collaborative effort. If JJ is smart\\, he'll bring on others (including fans who know the cannon well) to help put together an awesome plot and screenplay. As we have learned with TLJ\\, having great actors\\, cinematography\\, CGI\\, and musical score will not save a movie with a terrible plot and screenplay....","true":true}
