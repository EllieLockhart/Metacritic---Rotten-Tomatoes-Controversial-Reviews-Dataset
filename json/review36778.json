Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie seems to play along the magical Star Wars formula for that requires a Cantina-like setting+music\\, random Alien and Alien noises\\, and a money-making mascot\\, random guest stars\\, and simple plot to tell a safe story. Nothing inventive or innovative in this movie. Jokes and comedic dialogue felt updated and on par to space related movies of this year - Thor: Ragnarok and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Owned by Disney so the film is Disney-fied. You'll enjoy the movie if you want to see an un-trained Force user win against a semi-trained Force user. A movie that summarizes 24 hour of battle\\, little character development\\, Kylo Napoleon Dynamite Ren\\, questionable Force abilities. If you're a visual person\\, the film is visually appealing. Great special effects.","true":true}
