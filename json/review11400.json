Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible movie that wrecked the franchise. Trashed everything we've come to love about Star Wars\\, not to mention every plot point set up by the preceding movie\\, The Force Awakens. Plays with the audience\\, makes stupid choices and just plain makes no sense much of the time. A big\\, expensive waste of film.","true":true}
