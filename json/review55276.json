Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lazy script and story-telling not worthy of such a big budget in such a rich universe as star wars. Lack of creativity takes the movie to the most boring moments of all star wars franchise. And on top of that\\, characters and themes have reached the non-sense point where nothing matters anymore: jedi mythicism and training -> screwed up; surprising and dynamic space fights -> screwed up; cool and meaningful hand to hand fights -> screwed up; a badass evil villain -> screwed up; very basic star wars universe stuff totally destroyed (fuel really??\\, hyper-speed as a weapon sudden breakthrough really??\\, lightsabers do not cut flesh anymore really??\\, and so on and on...).\\nAt some moment this amazing universe was going to faint and disappear\\, and this is the movie where that moment has come\\, not only to all-time fans\\, but also to any adventure-fantasy-action genre fans.","true":true}
