Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The fail is strong with this one.  Horrible writing and directing.  Filled with wasted time\\, plot holes\\, tone mess\\, attempts at humor that ruin serious scenes\\, and shallow characters with no development clearly put in to fill a checklist for the social justice\\, diversity\\, and feminist agendas that were the overpowering themes in this movie.  This movie was a total mess.  Sad to see the quality of Star Wars movies drop to this level.","true":true}
