Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While parts of this movie are captivating and beautiful. The plot holes which find there way into the movie absolutely destroy what good can be found. For the true Star Wars fan this movie falls flat. Unable to stay true the character and values of those characters. The Last Jedi takes the magic of the Star Wars Universe and makes it into a hokey mess.","true":true}
