Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really liked this as a movie\\, but also as a star wars story. There are some flaws\\, but they didn't distract me much or hurt my enjoyment of the movie. I loved some of the main story arcs. I would have liked some more fleshed out character development of some. But ultimately it was super good and I think  the final resolution to this film gets down to what it is to be a Jedi.
