Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just realized I never reviewed this movie! I saw it with my brother and my wife\\, and we walked out with my brother immediately hating it\\, and me unsure\\, but trying to defend it. As time as gone\\, I found myself hating nearly every aspect of this movie from start to finish. \\n\\nI'm sure all one needs to do is google \\\"Last Jedi Criticism\\\" and the list would be endless. If it was just the bad humor\\, the porgs\\, and the Las Vegas  planet I had a problem with\\, I could probably find some redeemable qualities of the movie... but the treatment of Luke was so painfully awful\\, it's hard to even give this movie one star.\\n\\nThis movie made me question my love for The Force Awakens\\, and J.J. Abrams has such an impossible task if redeeming Star Wars again\\, I don't think it can happen","true":true}
