Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning. Writing was a bit \\\"how're ya going\\\" though. \\n\\nChase is drawn out and a bad way of motivating the plot. Luke's character is compromised in order to further the ascendancy of Rey as the hero and protagonist\\, which is poor form. Basically plot devices\\, character motivations\\, dialogue and behavioural choices are weak and too often clumsy in this movie.\\n\\nAlso\\, while I loved the emergence of a strong female protagonist in Rey in the prequel\\, although the fight scene with Kylo is a poor move which diminishes the merits of human effort\\, this movie takes it way too far. The Ladt Jedi is a blatant female empowerment movie at the cost of its male leads\\, shamefully using emotionally weak and compromised behaviour for every single male character\\, with female admonishment and saviours each time to further this (Poe vs Leia\\, Luke vs Rey\\, Kylo vs Rey\\, Poe vs Holdo\\, Finn vs Phasma\\, Finn vs random mechanic girl). It's pretty bad tbh.","true":true}
