Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Whether this is a 3 Stars or a 5 stars film depends on what you want out of a movie based on a Classic like Star Wars.   If you want to be entertained\\, enjoy action and dialog then this is 5 Stars. If you want the story to be consistent with the books\\, the animation series\\, and the old trilogies\\, then there\u0092s plenty of bones to pick.","true":true}
