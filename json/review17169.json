{"101487":139121,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really liked The Force Awakens.  Criticism over the plot's similarities to the original were fair\\, though it didn't bother me personally.  The plot was more of a familiar frame on which to hang\\, cool battles\\, likeable characters and their interactions\\, which the movie had in abundance.  The plot made sense\\, and was a fun romp\\, and that was enough.  Big bad thing\\, destroy it\\, heroism!  That said\\, The Force Awakens plot did include some intrigue which I was looking forward to seeing explored in the sequel.  Who is the mysterious and powerful Snoke?  Who are Rey's parents\\, set up in her force visions.  What is the story behind Kylo's turn to the dark-side and the Knights of Ren...\\n\\nBut The Last Jedi seems to revel in destroying everything interesting set up by the preceding movie.  It's like the director had a major beef with JJ Abrams and wanted to take a huge dump on his movie.  Snoke is just thrown out like trash.  The mystery of Rey's ancestry is unceremoniously dumped.  Luke's poignant entrance at the end Force Awakens\\, the whole point\\, and crecendo of the entire movie... thrown away for a cheap gag.\\n\\nThen there are the plot holes.  The worst offender\\, the whole plot revolves around this slow motion chase where apparently the Imperial ships are too large and slow to catch up with the fleeing rebels.  Even if you can suspend disbelief and assume that the entire imperial fleet contains no ships of a suitable size and weight to chase down the rebels\\, there is a glaring plot hole.  Why not just jump a couple of ships through hyperspace\\, in front of the fleeing rebels\\, and wipe them out?\\n\\nThere are huge inconsistencies with ship's shields.  It's been established throughout the series that fighters cannot fly through ship's shields\\, shields always have to be dropped to allow an attack.  It's why Obiwan was on the death star\\, why Han was on Endor.  Even in this movie the whole reason for Finn and Rose to go on their lame sidequest is to drop the shields so they can board Snoke's ship.  But in the opening scene Poe and his fighters just fly right up to the dreadnaught and begin attacking.  Then Kylo just flies straight inside Leia's cruiser and blows up their fighter bay.  The bridge is also apparently un-shielded as that is destroyed by a couple of puny tie fighters. But then mysteriously the ship is then impervious to hits from much larger lasers for the rest of the movie\\, thanks to... its shields...\\n\\nPerhaps a nit-pick\\, but after the bridge is destroyed\\, Leia is violently sucked into the vacuum of space\\, just like in cool sci-fi movies everywhere.  After her (also extremely questionable) display of previously unseen force prowess\\, she flies over to the door behind which her friends are waiting.  The door opens and suddenly the vacuum of space is forgotten\\, hugs all round.\\n\\nThen there is the extremely tenuous thread supporting the movie's major sub-plot.  The random new rebel commander has a great plan to escape the Empire\\, but she REPEATEDLY refuses to tell ANYONE about it.  Unsurprisingly she looses the trust of many key players and they embark on a secondary mission which ends up not only being a complete waste of time (on the laughably shallow planet Gringotts)\\, but actually results in the death of most of the rebellion.  All because she couldn't be arsed to explain her actual plan\\, insisting instead that they all have 'hope'\\, apparently in some weird trial of faith...\\n\\nSnoke is the most powerful force user we have seen in any Star Wars movie.  He turns Kylo to the dark side\\, even while he is actively being trained by Luke.  He tosses Rey (according to Luke\\, the most raw power he has ever witnessed) around his chamber with barely a twitch of his finger.  He is able to semi-physically connect Rey and Kylo with each other from across the galaxy.  But he is unable read Kylo's intentions or to notice him using the force to rotate a light sabre on his arm rest\\, a few centimeters from his body...\\n\\nThere are so many more niggles.  Especially the humor.  It was all well written and genuinely funny\\, but most of it just didn't belong\\, and was seemingly employed to diffuse every possible dramatic moment.  It reminded me of the Marvel movies.  I like their irreverent tone\\, but it is a poor fit for Star Wars\\, which has always had humor\\, but also taken dramatic situations a little more seriously.  \\n\\nThere were only two moments when my cinema audibly chuckled.  Chewie eating the cute bird thing (which was funny\\, though you have question why his conscience didn't kick in when he was murdering and spit roasting the thing).  The second was the supposedly dramatic scene of Leia flying through space like a geriatric superman.\\n\\nStructurally the movie was a bit of a mess too.  Cutting between the dull casino side-quest (which achieved nothing).  The non-training on Luke's island.  (Rey reaching out with her arm instead of the force was the only truly terrible gag in the movie).  Thinking about it\\, there were a bunch of non events in the movie.  Finn & Rose's quest achieved nothing.  Rey never really got trained.  The skimmer attack at the end looked cool\\, but achieved nothing.\\n\\nThe turn of Kylo Ren was at least given some attention\\, and the 'unreliable narrator' take was kind of interesting.  But it was never given enough time or thought.   Luke apparently achieved (in RotJ) the calm disposition of a true Jedi master\\, and was convinced to the end that there was good left in the child murdering Vader. Are we honestly to believe that he would so impulsively decide to execute the only child of his own sister and best friend?  And what of the flashbacks from The Force Awakens\\, the 'Knights of Ren'.  I would have loved to see Snoke's story\\, and the fall of Kylo Ren given more time.  It could have happily replaced the 'free the animals' romp on the casino planet.  But at least they touched on it.\\n\\nThere WAS stuff I liked.  The opening scene was tense and awesomely paced.  The Yoda scene was great\\, classic Yoda (though it hinges on Luke taking himself too seriously\\, which was off kilter in this movie as they turned Luke into a nutty Yoda like character on the island).  The scene in Snoke's chamber was awesome\\, even though his death was a little unbelievable.  All of the final battle on the planet was cool\\, and Luke got a good ending.  The visuals and film-making in general were great.  The kid at the end force pulling the broom annoyed me in an extremely 'prequel trilogy' way.\\n\\nLooking forward to seeing if JJ can fix it up for the next one...","true":true}
