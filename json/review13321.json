Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I encourage anyone who liked this movie to go watch it again. I'm no Star Wars fan\\, and I didn't have high expectations. I just wanted to enjoy a movie with my wife. However\\, I honestly felt like the first hour or so I was watching a parody of a Star Wars movie. The ending of the movie on planet Crait was entertaining\\, but overall the plot holes\\, bad directing\\, worse acting and \\\"aha\\\" moments that were diminished because they were already \\\"aha\\\" moments in Force Awakens\\, were too much to overcome. Honestly\\, Leia's Superman impression to a window with everyone waiting for her almost caused me to leave the theater.","true":true}
