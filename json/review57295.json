Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is an insult to the franchise. Luke Skywalker would never do the things his character did in this movie. And when is Rey actually going to train? You know that thing you do when you want to get good at something.","true":true}
