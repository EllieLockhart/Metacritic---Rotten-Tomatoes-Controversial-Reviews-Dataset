Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily better than EP7 just by virtue of being... an actual NEW Star Wars movie\\, lmao! Glad to see the storyline progress\\, even though the heroes still get away with too much.","true":true}
