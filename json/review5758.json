Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disapointing storyline twists sucked the fun out of this one. What they call \\\"character development\\\" was \\\"character degeneration\\\"\\, especially for Luke. Some characters are so conflicted that I no longer care about them.The attack on the big cannon sequence was totally botched. Special effects were great. I'm not going to add this one to my collection. I'll probably see SW IX just to see how the saga ends\\, but it's no longer a \\\"must see\\\". I'll stop here to avoid posting spoilers.","true":true}
