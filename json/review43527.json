Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was different from expectations and all the hyped predictions. A little bit of a let down for the star wars die-hard\\, but has a mixture of Mavel movie comedy. Overall enjoyable movie\\, but I can see that Disney is trying to open up the Star Universe $$ and not limited to a family soap opera like the original.","true":true}
