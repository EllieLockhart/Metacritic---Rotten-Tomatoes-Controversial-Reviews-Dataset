Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After being a Star Wars fan for 20 years and really wrestling with this film back and forth\\, I can say this is equally next to the Empire strikes back the best Star Wars film. I\u2019m reading reviews throughout the audience scope saying that this was their least favorite Star Wars film and I have to say I completely disagree. Star Wars is not about the characters from 34-40 years ago anymore\\, it is about a new generation and the fans from 34-40 years ago are just going to have to suck it up. George Lucas does not helm the franchise anymore\\, fans that grew up watching the films have to understand that. Story is being created outside of George Lucas\u2019s mind and I think that is the best thing that could happen to this franchise. George is not allowed to create everything about Star Wars in his own little box. He knew that when he sold it to Disney\\, he knew that it was time for him to watch as a fan\\, not a creator. Listen here Star Wars fans\\, this is a great movie and you cannot deny it just because the story and again quoting Luke\\, \u201cdoesn\u2019t go the way you think\u201d and you have to be OK with this. It still makes for a great story and it makes room for the new characters to shine in the final film of this trilogy.","true":true}
