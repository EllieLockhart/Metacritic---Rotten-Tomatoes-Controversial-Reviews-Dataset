Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you are a hard core Star Wars fan this movie will make your blood boil!  Are you kidding me?  Rian Johnson had an opportunity to bring Stars Wars back for a new generation.  Now none of the younger fans will care to watch episode 9 and I don't know if I care to either!  Star Wars is a story of the force and good and evil\\, but it is also the Skywalker story.  Luke is gone\\, Han is gone\\, Leia will be gone\\, and no one bothered to bring back Lando.  Rey is just a nobody now? This movie sucked like Jar Jar binks!  Won't anyone listen to the fans?  I'm done with the new Star Wars films!  It's all about the money now.  Well good luck selling this for very long!","true":true}
