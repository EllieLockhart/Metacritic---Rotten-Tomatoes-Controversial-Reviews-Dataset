Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a huge Star Wars fan and this is the best one since ESB. The hate towards this movie is unfair and based upon expectations and nit-picking. Enjoy the movie for what it is: a Star Wars movie. Enjoy the movie and be kind and thoughtful about your opinions.","true":true}
