Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This has to be the worst movie of 2017. The plot is completely ridiculous\\, the characters are all incompetent\\, and the Marvelesque humor throughout makes it impossible to care about anything that happens. It succeeds in killing off any of the nostalgia from the original trilogy that The Force Awakens may have left limping along. Just when you think they couldn't make any worse creative decisions\\, they surprise you with the stupidest possible choice of where to take the movie. If you were not already a huge Star Wars fan\\, this movie has nothing to offer at all. If you were already a huge Star Wars fan\\, this movie will crush your soul and spit on it\\, while laughing at you. Nothing about this movie is good at all\\, don't waste your time.","true":true}
