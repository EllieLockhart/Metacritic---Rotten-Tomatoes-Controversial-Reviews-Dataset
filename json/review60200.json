Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I don't usually write reviews\\, but I felt like I needed to in this case\\, especially after reading lots of positive reviewers trying to dismiss the negative reviews as review bombing.\rPeople simply feel that way about the game.

The game makes them feel that way. It's legit.\r\rBefore I go into detail as to why I rate the game so low I wanna say that I never played the first part and didn't know any of the characters previously\\, so that didn't have any effect on me. Still from all the characters I saw in the second part\\, I thought Tommy and Joel were the most appealing and interesting ones\\, so I was kind of disappointed when we didn't get to play with them\\, but ok.\r\rThe other characters were ok\\, though and the story isn't entirely bad in my opinion. It makes a statement without anyone actually putting it into words. BUT I don't wanna play games like that. There's enough misery going on in the world\\, I don't need it to provoke thought in my free time\\, the time I need to get my mind off things. I watch the news every day\\, I am aware of the effects of revenge\\, escalations etc etc. I don't need to be lectured about that in a game. Doesn't mean there can't be any intelligent statements\\, no morals at all. But this game is like solely about that. It is depressing in many\\, many situations.\rThen there are some plot holes and illogical premisses...I don't wanna spoil\\, in case someone doesn't know the game yet\\, but you'll probably notice them yourself. In the end you might find yourself feeling like....wtf\\, it was all for nothing! At least that's how I felt... frustrated and downright sad and like I needed to lick my wounds. Throughout the games there were some uplifting moments\\, but they were very sparse and in no way adequate to make up for the rest.\r\rI forced myself to finish the game\\, though because I wanted to see everything before I judge it. I really had a hard time. The gameplay is mediocre and not appropriate for a game in 2020.\rThe graphics are mostly very nice and there are beautiful landscapes. There was also a lot of weird glitching (horses\\, dogs\\, fighting scenes)  and the 30 fps were a strain on my eyes. Sometimes had to stop playing because it gave me a headache.\r\rMy verdict: The few good points don't make up for the rest. I feel like I should have watched the game on stream instead of buying it. In fact I regret spending that money. Next time naughty dogs releases a game I'll be sure to check it on stream or youtube first.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
