Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Utter garbage filled with plot holes. The star fights were alright\\, but again the logic and lore that were previously established in star wars has been broken. Princess Leia's new ability is also immersion breaking. They destroy the image of Luke Skywalker\\, and the final Luke scene in the movie is anything but satisfying. Admiral Akbar also makes a similarly unsatisfying appearance. Rey is ridiculously overpowered with no sense of character progression. Also the politics of the movie turned me off. This does not love up to the expectations of a start wars movie in the slightest.","true":true}
