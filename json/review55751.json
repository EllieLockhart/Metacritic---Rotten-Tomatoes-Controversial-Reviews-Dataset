Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall\\, it is a decent movie.  I thought the acting was pretty well done\\, good space battles.  \\n\\nI probably just expected certain things to happen that \\\"didn't go the way I thought.\\\"  I was expecting to see Luke have more than a 10 second fight scene only to collapse and die at the end.  Fans of the original trilogy waited decades and Luke is finally back in action to hardly fight or showcase his powers at all. I didn't think Snoke was going to get destroyed so quickly with all of the mystery surrounding him.  Rey's parents were seriously just alcoholics that left her on Jakku?  I think I'm getting a little sick of the dysfunctional family abandonment issues.  I also expected to see more lightsaber duels.  Rey is barely trained whatsoever by Luke and just leaves\\, maybe because she is apparently a super saiyan force user and just figures everything out on her own.  Luke really thought about killing Ben Solo and nearly tried?  I don't think Luke Skywalker as a character would do something like that.  \\n\\nI really hope Disney takes into account what audiences are saying about the film seriously and remedy it (if possible) in Episode IX.  I was also hoping to see other force ghosts like Obi-Wan Kenobi\\, Qui-Gon Jinn\\, etc.","true":true}
