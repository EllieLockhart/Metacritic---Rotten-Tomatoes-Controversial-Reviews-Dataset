And it will be your choices that determine whether this group of cocky teenagers live or die\\, and your choices actually have a meaningful effect on the story! (looking at you\\, Beyond Two Souls) Another thing Until Dawn does right is the amazing graphics\\, there is a heap of detail in every environment\\, so that really enhances the experience. Another thing that makes Until Dawn great is that the story behind why the ghost is attacking you\\, or why the ghost is haunting you\\, these facts are not handed to you\\, you have to search for clues in the environment that explain what's going on.
