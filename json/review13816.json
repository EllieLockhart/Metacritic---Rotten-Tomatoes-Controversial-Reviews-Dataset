Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If possible\\, I would give it zero stars. \\n\\nIt was a beautiful film. \\n\\nDozens of plot holes. I question if Rian Johnson has ever seen a Starwars Film before because this was not one. \\n\\nIt was painfully slow paced\\, it didn't make sense how this happened more moments after TFA\\, characters choices didn't make sense. \\n\\nIt was trash.","true":true}
