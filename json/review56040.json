Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So clearly\\, this movie has been the target of a very divisive fanbase. You either hate this movie or love it. I love it.  That's fine; everyone has their own opinions. Here's mine:\\n\\nPros:\\n-The acting was fine.\\n-The special effects were great.\\n-The twists were shocking\\, fun\\, and interesting.\\n-The action was well choreographed and unique.\\n-The themes were clear.\\n-The conflict was clear as well.\\n-The obstacles were strong and vivid.\\n-The movie plays on your expectations really well.\\n\\nCons:\\n-The first hour and a half or so are a little lackluster in terms of tension\\, pacing\\, and conflict.\\n-Rose is pretty useless as a whole.\\n-The casino scene is out of place.\\n-Some of the creatures in the movie were meaningless to the overarching plot (i.e. Porgs).\\n\\nOverall\\, definitely worth seeing.","true":true}
