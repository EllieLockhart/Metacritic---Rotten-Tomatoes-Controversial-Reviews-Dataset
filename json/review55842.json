Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably the best out of the new trilogy. If only Disney had let Rian Johnson direct episode IX we may have gotten something better than the train wreck that JJ Abrams directed with \\\"The Rise of Skywalker\\,\\\" a film I plan to never watch again and will hopefully forget even exist.","true":true}
