Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you liked the Clone Wars animated series and the original trilogy (episodes 4\\, 5 and 6) you should like this movie because it feels like a mix of both. Like the Clone Wars it has lots of action and battles. Like the Clone Wars it had a lot of dabbling deeper into the force\\, superhuman force wielding and awesome lightsaber battles. Most of the ships\\, land vehicles\\, about 50% of the music\\, and 3 of the characters were from or similar to the original series. To the people who said there was too much humor\\, I say they should go back and watch the original series and see that it's the same amount.\\n  To the haters out there that think it didn't go anywhere subplot or story wise I would say . . . first of all\\, Star Wars always has mostly been about battles. Secondly I would say that it's a friggin movie and entertainment is what it's for\\, not getting things done. If your bored with an action-packed subplot not going anywhere\\, then get your popcorn eating butt out of the theater and go chop some wood or something. Also\\, doesn't that make it more realistic since real life is a lot of times a struggle  that  doesn't go anywhere? AND THIRD\\, I would say this movie is mostly about character development and that most of the characters start out confused and lost and that by the end they all truly \\\"find their place\\\". Rey even talks about finding her place and Luke talks about literally being in a hard to find place. How much spelling out what it's about do you need? \\n   To the commenter who said they didn't think bombs could drop because there is no gravity in space . . . what do you think keeps the space station and moon going around the Earth and the planets going around the sun!? ON the space station in ORBIT\\, there is simulated weightlessness but without going further into the physics\\, let's just say you shouldn't claim to know the physics are wrong when you clearly know very little about physics. Stay in school kids.\\n   In the end I would say it seemed very true to the feel of past Star Wars stories but with some new people going some new places with some new understandings in a new 30-year-later time frame and killer visual effects. I personally loved it and thought it was awesome and will go see it at the theater at least 1 or 2 more times.","true":true}
