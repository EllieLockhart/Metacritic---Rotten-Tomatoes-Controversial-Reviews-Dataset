Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS IN REVIEW\\nSubverts expectations very poorly and ties up loose strings early. Who was Snoke? What was his past? Oh\\, nevermind\\, he's now dead. Rose was a charismatic character but her decisions in this movie were idiotic and stupid. Finn's arc could have been wonderfully completed in this movie with him originally being in the First Order to him dying for the Resistance\\, but then nope! Rose had to save him and kiss him awkwardly. It was interesting to watch but ties up too many ends and leaves an unsatisfying taste in your mouth.","true":true}
