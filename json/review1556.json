{"101487":105145,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-22","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lifelong Star Wars fan\\, I feel it's time to walk away.\\n\\nEnter Luke with the new \\\"apprentice\\\" of no one apparently\\, who has mastered the force on her own with zero training. Luke throws away lightsaber (Ha ha guys screw the Jedi). (Cut Scene Cut Scene) Girl Power Rey follows Luke around island where Luke is committed to being a hermit because he Star pupil Emo Ren Solo decided to burn down the college.\\n\\n(Cut scene Jump Scene) to \\\"The Resistance\\\" somewhere in space running out of gas. Poe\\, the apt pilot with great insight\\, fights with Laura Dern over some misunderstanding of the Patriarchy\/Matriarchy dynamic\\, she slaps him\\, she tells him to basically shut his male talking hole. (Women are in charge now Boys!).\\n\\n(Cut Scene Jump Scene) Snake AKA \\\"Snoke\\\" who has no actual background story and no development begins to say some bad stuff. (Muh Dark Side Dark Side). He's got all the White Nationalists following him on Space Twitter or something. \\n\\n(Jump scene) \\\"The Jedi must end\\\" says Luke. Because he screwed up as a professor of the college burnt down by his Emo Nephew. Oh wait\\, let's jump to the Nephew Emo Ren having second thoughts about nuking his Mom. Why\\, oh because Rey the Greatest Jedi that ever lived\\, has been having a love affair with him through telepathy\\, or Jedi TINDER.\\n\\nSo Leia (Carrie Fisher is being immortalized in death mind you) gets blown up and flies around like NEO\\, or Mary Poppins. \\n\\nRey the Apprentice is back on the Island training still and she's SO POWERFUL OMG\\, and her teacher\\, Luke\\, supposedly one of the greatest Jedis ever\\, is now drinking heavily\\, from a WALRUS...which is normal and cute. Toss in some cute Penguins that make noises with Chewbacca\\, how cute. It's all so cute.\\n\\n(Jump scene again) back to the purple haired Matriarch Boss Laura Dern\\, who by the way\\, had absolutely no business in this film\\, but why not!!?? And she has a 'plan' that nobody knows and would have saved WEEKS of filming if she just told others her plans. And now \\\"The Black Guy\\\" is trying to come help with his own game plan where he meets \\\"The Asian Girl\\\" in the basement. And now they're a thing. And she has no place in this film either. Oh and\\, she has no emotions that are appropriate or realistic. (How did she get cast??) Who knows?\\n\\n(Jump Scene) They meet Benicio Del Toro in a jail\\, after being thrown out of the \\\"1%ers\\\" rich casino\\, and he luckily knows how to hack POOTERS\\, just what they were looking for\\, because why not. He escapes through some method\\, because why not.\\n\\nMeanwhile Rey is getting closer to the \\\"Bad Boy\\\" because of course all strong women need to change Bad Boys (She friend zones \\\"The Black Dude\\\") And back on the last Big Ship Laura Dern and her purple hair stay behind after secretly gassing up the smaller ships...her \\\"plan\\\" that she never told anyone of value. And now she's a Kamikaze pilot representin' the Matriarchy by taking out the White Nationalists with her ship. \\n\\n\\\"May the Force be with You\\\"...or something!!\\n\\nMeanwhile \\\"Le Resistance\\\" escapes down to some random planet where they're followed by the White Nationalists\\, who setup a huge cannon. \\\"The Black Guy\\\" tries his best to shut it all down with a sacrificial move but \\\"The Asian\\\" ruins his plans because \\\"Love Wins\\\"...and then she kisses him\\, in which not even his acting could hide he wasn't into her like he is Rey.\\n\\nSo here we are with \\\"Crystal Critters\\\" running around on the salt planet\\, nevermind explaining how wolves got CRYSTALS on their skin\\, but oh well we just give up at this point. So Luke's ghost visits the planet because his enraged Emo student\\, Kylo Safe Space\\, needs to kill him because Rey is not taking his calls anymore.\\n\\nAnd Mark Hammill character...LUKE EFFING SKYWALKER was projecting a Jedi hologram of himself the entire time. \\\"Hahaha jokes on you guys\\, I really AM committed to this Hermit life\\\". And jump scene after his robe falls down. End scene some kid is sweeping with a broom. I wonder if he's the new Jedi for the NEXT failed plot scene.\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\nThis movie was terrible. Characters were nowhere near what the Star Wars Saga actually\\, historically\\, represents. The scenes jump around as if the Director wanted to show us the best highlights for trailers\\, but forgot that Star Wars is a STORY. Half of the film was wasted on useless characters\\, a useless plot line\\, and the main characters were either shafted\\, predictable\\, boring\\, or bumbling.\\n\\nThe INSULT to Carrie Fisher's character with the NEO\/MATRIX move was beyond stupid. People literally laughed out loud in the theater I was in. Yoda's appearance was so nonsensical\\, because he basically tells LUKE\\, a Grand Jedi Master that Rey\\, a girl who literally is learning to be a Jedi on her own in about 4 days time\\, somehow has \\\"all the knowledge\\\" of said old books.\\n\\nLaura Dern got her gig because she's of the Dern family\\, let's be honest. She in no way needed to be in this film. Finn and his love interest were stupid. Luke's END\\, as the greatest Jedi in FILM that ever lived\\, was so baffling and needless\\, that if I were Mark Hamill\\, I would sue Disney. \\n\\nThe \\\"Matriarchal\\\" tone of this was so obvious it was on the verge of a political speech. The \\\"out with the old\\\" lines also supported that fact that Disney wants Star Wars to be for female teens or young female Millennials\\, and it seems like ONLY they were in mind when this botched script was being written.\\n\\nI can say that every single Star Wars film made\\, I have watched repeatedly\\, and that includes \\\"The Jar Jar\\\" era\\, grudgingly. But THIS episode? I have not one bit of need or want to even see this again. If this were a Picasso painting\\, it would be something that is found at some yard sales as his unknown work...a sketch on a page for practice.\\n\\nAnd it's because of this episode\\, I've decided to no longer even CARE what Disney or whoever says or does with the \\\"Franchise\\\". Star Wars is dead. For actual fans\\, and people who appreciate good film. If you're going to make a film based on Left political or Matriarchal premises\\, and least try and make it GOOD\\, or even watchable. This latest was just an embarrassment. I don't even want to TALK about Star Wars after this.\\n\\nWhat did you do???","true":true}
