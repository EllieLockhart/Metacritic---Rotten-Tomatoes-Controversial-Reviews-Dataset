Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was great in my opinion\\, I loved how they portrayed Rey and kylo ren\\, there were a few moments in this film that I felt\\, could be improved\\, not going to touch on it because you'll probably know what I'm talking about once you've seen it for yourself\\, I'm excited for the finale of this trilogy in two years and can't wait to see how it all ends","true":true}
