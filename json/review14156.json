Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you want to watch a cool movie with stunning visual effects and big surprises in the story\\, you will love this movie. If you're a Star Wars fan however\\, you'll probably be deeply disappointed by the massive plot holes and major inconsistencies with both the other movies and itself; accompanied with some flat-out bad writing. Thanks Disney for the cool explosions I guess...","true":true}
