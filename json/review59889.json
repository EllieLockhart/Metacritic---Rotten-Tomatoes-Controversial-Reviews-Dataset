People claiming that games are not supposed to be about politics are frustrated because this game has so much representation and they can't accept that different people are represented. There is a black man who is a leader\\, a lesbian woman (Ellie)\\, a bisexual woman\\, a trans boy\\, asian people\\, people with disabilities... I mean\\, the game represents life as it is. And yes\\, it's political. To represent marginalized people in games is a political act and one that hopes to make gamers a little more empathetic. By the way\\, empathy is key to understand characters' decisions and motivations. It's a game for a MATURE audience.\rThis is the best game of the generation. One that everyone should play. It doesn't matter if the plot will not appeal so much to you\\, you're still going to love to play this game. It's a majestic evolution of the first part.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
