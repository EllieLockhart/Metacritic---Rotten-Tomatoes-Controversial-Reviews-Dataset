Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This instantly became one of my favorite Star Wars movies. I\u2019m a very dedicated fan of the franchise and went in with high expectations. I was not disappointed! I\u2019m really confused about the low rating this movie has gotten so far. Rian Johnson did a great job developing the characters and I\u2019m really excited for what he will do with his own trilogy","true":true}
