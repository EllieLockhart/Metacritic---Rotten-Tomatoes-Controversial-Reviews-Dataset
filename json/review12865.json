Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't like it as much as I thought I would when I first saw TLJ.  I saw it again today and I loved it.  It was highly emotional and I applaud the new direction in story telling for Star Wars.  For the fanboys who are upset\\, try seeing it again with an open mind.","true":true}
