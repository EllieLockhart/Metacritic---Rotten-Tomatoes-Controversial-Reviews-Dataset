Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson turned this into his own playground and failed true Star Wars fans everywhere. Too much to type in describing the many faults of this film. Awful.\\n\\n\\\"What a piece of junk!\\\" -Luke Skywalker","true":true}
