Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was gonna give this movie 3 stars but then I saw it again and it was better. Recommend everyone go see it again!! It\u2019s such an intricate story for the saga and changes the game! Super excited how they will end the saga in episode 9","true":true}
