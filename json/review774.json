Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An emotional rollercoaster\\, this movie didn't give what I expected or thought I wanted\\, but I left more satisfied than I would have been if it had gone according to plan.  A solid edition to the franchise and a worthy steppingstone to episode 9.","true":true}
