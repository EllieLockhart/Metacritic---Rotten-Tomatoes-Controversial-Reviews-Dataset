{"101487":196302,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-26","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where to begin.  Lets assume for a moment that it wasn't egregious that Rian Johnson bucked the nostalgia trend and moved star wars into a new direction.  \\\"Let the past die\\\"\\, i get it.  This notion is hip and fresh and really takes us out of Good vs Evil\/Jedi vs Sith.  Now\\, where this movie had great moments (Kylo not turning to the \\\"lightside\\\" after he killed snoke) Overall is was a 2\/5 hour borefest with a the most lazily written main plot that while oddly shook up Star wars forever\\, did very little to advance this stories plot through 2 movies.  You can feel the disney touch all over this one.  The jokes are bad\\, there's missing plots holes\\, and Rian Johnson now has decided that your truly more powerful with no training in the force\\, Leia can fly\\, and somehow the link between rey and kylo is still there.  Its cool\\, we dont need explaination for these things\\, we can fan theory it\\, but ummm\\, hey\\, remember last movie all these loose ends we expected to get in this movie...WE NEVER GOT ANY!!!.  All momentum made by TFA was dropped by this one.  Through two movies\\, i kind of still have no idea wtf were all doing.  Like i said\\, there was refreshing ideas in this movie\\, Kylo Ren is a great Grey area character\\, Luke's 'the force doesn't belong to anyone' is great.  The destruction of the jedi and sith\\, again awesome! but overall\\, this isnt a very good movie.  The only reason to watch it is because its called STAR WARS.","true":true}
