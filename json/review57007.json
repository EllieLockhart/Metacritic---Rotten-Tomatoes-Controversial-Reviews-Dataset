Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They tried to include everything in a single movie. It's a lot. Snoke still not clear but it seems his job is done and you can barely feel the Kylo's conflict. And after this one\\, you must face the fact that they will end this trilogy in about 3 hours. I think they could do better if they just slow it down and explain everything step by step. But still\\, I really enjoy this. They created a lot of surprises for us.\\nI cried for my Princess Leia. It's been one year but I still cannot accept that. Really Love they use \\\"In Loving Memory of Our Princess\\, Carrie Fisher\\\" at the end.","true":true}
