Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everything about this film is purely epic. It's the largest scale Star Wars yet  done\\, and the disdain is nothing short of baffling. Rian Johnson delivered as close to a perfect entry into the saga as possible with twists\\, turns\\, shocking moments\\, huge battles\\, big reveals\\, and new questions to set up episode 9. This may be my favorite of the series so far. Does it give us the previously rote prescribed path for our original trilogy heroes? Nope\\, not even a little bit\\, and that's why it's incredible. People need to get over their preconceived notions and see the excitement of a now-truly unknown future.","true":true}
