Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I like this film more then the Force Awakens because a least the plot was original and not a rehash of a prior movie. The problem for me is the middle of the movie is just very boring the and screws with the pacing. Every time I watch I ding it harder to get through the second act. It doesn\u2019t help that\u2019s the whole Canto Bight sequence amounted to nothing. I personally think it was a mistake to kill of Luke Skywalker in the film too. The action was good but the story was just meh I feel like nothing really progressed.","true":true}
