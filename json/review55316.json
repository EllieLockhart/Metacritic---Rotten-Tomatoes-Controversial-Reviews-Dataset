Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like many others I'm disappointed in how Disney and non George Lucas handled Star Wars since it was purchased. I am not a Episode VII or VIII fan. Both movies make no sense and that's coming from the Star Wars universe. It doesn't have the same feel as the movies that came before it. Episode I\\, II\\, and III feel like they are in the SW universe. SW didn't have to be rejuvenated. The reason it's been making so much money is because it's STAR WARS and the original trio was attached to the film. It was guaranteed. I wish they stayed true to what came before.\\n\\nMark my words..people will say the prequels are better then the sequels in the future.\\n\\nThat being said...Rogue One is an amazing movie. At least it had good flow.","true":true}
