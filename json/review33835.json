Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible. No Snoke backstory. Luke was made to look pointless. If Ben and Rey are that strong why cant they easily take care of the guards? Finn is unnecessary to the plot. The mirror scene made no sense. The emo force texting was only cringe-worthy. I hated it.","true":true}
