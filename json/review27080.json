Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the most divisise yet\\, best film to date. They are now trying to tell their own story instead of trying to relive the trilogy yet again\\, and it's pissing a lot of people off. \\n\\nRyan Johson is trying to give out a clear message in this movie\\, and it is best explained by Kylo Ren himself. \\n\\n\\\"Let the past die\\, kill it\\, if you have to\\\" \\n\\nIt resumes the story perfectly and where Star Wars needs to go to continue for generations to come.","true":true}
