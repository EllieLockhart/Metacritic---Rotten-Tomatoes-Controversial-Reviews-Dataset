Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If Finn wasn't bad enough\\, we now get a second pointless character\\, Rose. They both brought nothing to this movie and the director decides to spend a whole 30+ mins on them. This was supposed to be about Rey's relationship with Luke and Kylo with Snouk. This movie ignored all questions asked in the previous movie.","true":true}
