Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ruined Star wars for me. Although it may be a good blockbuster film\\, it is NOT a good STAR WARS film. The politics\\, feminism and racism issues it touches on is not why I fell in love with Star wars. I fell in love with its simplicity and magic\\, not this thing riddled with plot hole\\, stale jokes and political themes Rian Jhonson calls a film. Dissapointing.","true":true}
