Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Aside from a couple pacing issues and some unnecessary moments that drug the middle of the film on\\, this movie was phenomenal. All the twists completely caught me off-guard\\, and I can say I\u2019m satisfied with all the major plot decisions. Also\\, this is just a visually beautiful film. How much longer until IX\\, again?","true":true}
