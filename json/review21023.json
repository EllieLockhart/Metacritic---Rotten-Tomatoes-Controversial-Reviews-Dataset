Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. I loved all the twists and unexpected turns that kept me wanting more. The wait for the next installment in the series seems so far away. ","true":true}
