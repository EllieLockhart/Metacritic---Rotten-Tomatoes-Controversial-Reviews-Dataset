Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By far the worst Star Wars movie. Completely ruined the series for me. It answers none of the questions the force awakens left you with. Terrible lackluster endings for character. You spend more time with characters and subplots no one cares about . Betrays the characters you grew up with. Just awful awful awful. I'd take jar jar binks over this any day .","true":true}
