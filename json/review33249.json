Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Suckered Again!  \\nStory line is completely and 100% irrelevant to the stakeholders.  There are so many holes\\, unnecessary plot lines that go no where and characters who bring nothing to move the plot forward.  So angry that they don't care to get it right.  SO MUCH WASTED!!!   \\nThe best part of Mark Hamill's acting.  He did a great job even though there were elements of the winey side.\\n\\nHow do these story meetings go?  Do they just sit around and discuss CGI scenes and then throw words on a page the day before shooting??","true":true}
