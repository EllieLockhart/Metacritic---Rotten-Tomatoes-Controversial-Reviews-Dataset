Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Waste of talent\\, bad plot - plot holes everywhere\\, bad directing\\, no progressive character build ups\\, it can't be certified fresh\\, any big fan will know it isn't right a huge disrespect to major characters\\, it did have it's moments but film just had too many problems. They had Gollum one of the greatest talent and didn't utilise him well -  imagine his skills with a light sabre! No light sabre fights with major characters =( No exciting storm trooper combat fights\/battles. Same goes for many other characters but could be writing for hours. They have to pull some miracle to save the next episode.","true":true}
