Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a fan of the originals since my childhood\\, this is one of the best entries in the saga. Not as good as the classic trilogy\\, but amazingly entertaining\\, full of actual surprises\\, and far superior to the prequels.","true":true}
