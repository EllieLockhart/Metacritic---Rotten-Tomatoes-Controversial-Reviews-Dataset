Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the worst Star Wars movie yet. Between this and the sleeping pill Rogue One\\, I never want to see another new Star Wars movie again\\, and I am a huge fan of the original trilogy and the third prequel. Why the hell did they kill Snoke and not explain anything about him? It\u2019s things like that that even make Force Awakens a worse movie\\, because now I know those were empty promises. These new Star Wars movies are awful.","true":true}
