Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed this movie\\, until the ending. The ending is just meh. I guess the second chapter of a trilogy is supposed to end on a depressing note but still have a bit of hope (just like attack of the clones and empire strikes back.) However I wanted more from this trilogies second act and it saddens me that this movie ended the way it did. Still\\, there are so many good scenes and some not so good that will leave you scratching your head. A few of the subplot elements and scenes are questionable. Overall\\, it\u2019s a good movie on the verge of being great. Casual fans will definitely like it\\, it\u2019s just the more hardcore fans that might find problems with it.","true":true}
