{"101487":174530,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(The Force Awakens spoilers.)\\nFor anyone that is watching this as a standalone film; this would be at best a mildly entertaining light hearted action movie\\, but made far less enjoyable by several rather large plot holes\\, a lack of any real story development\\, and a plethora of characters and story arcs that didn't affect the outcome of the movie at all\\, that seem to have been added to the movie purely to force diversity\\, feminism\\, animal rights\\, and \\\"insert political agenda here\\\" into the movie and the cost of good casting and story writing.\\nFor anyone who's only experience of Star Wars is the Disney Films\\, then we have the added issues of nearly all the interesting sub-plots introduced in The Force Awakens being dropped or simply ignored. We learn absolutely nothing new about the new characters of Snoke\\, Phasma\\, Maz Kanata and General Hux. The original trilogy characters Chewbacca\\, R2D2\\, C3PO and Admiral Ackbar are not given ANY development at all and are pretty much cameos and name drops at this point. Related to story inconsistencies and dropped plot points; it is clearly established from the very beginning of the movie that this takes place directly after the events of The Force Awakens\\, yet somehow\\, The First Order is now the superpower and the Resistance is now on the run. Any story around Luke Skywalker's lightsaber is 'tossed aside' and never mentioned. The Knights of Ren don't even appear by name in this movie. Kylo Ren's obsession with Darth Vader isn't mentioned at all and considering this movie takes place directly after TFA\\, no one really seems that bothered that Han Solo has literally just died at the hands of his and Leia's son\\, and Luke's apprentice.\\n\\nFor anyone who has been a fan of Star Wars since the original Trillogy\\, the Prequels\\, or even Disney's own Star Wars Rebels\\, there are too many problems to mention\\, but the primary issues are; The general tone of the film. With some of the key things that happen in this film it should have been a pretty dark film with some really intense moments\\, but they have injected Marvel style humor into this film at every opportunity and it kills the tension in nearly every important scene and makes it feel like you're not really watching a Star Wars film at all. There are no intimidating bad guys\\, no threat at all to the heroes. Kylo Ren lost badly to Rey in TFA\\, and shows no sign of being any more competent in this movie. Hux was actually a pretty intimidating character in TFA but is made the butt of the joke in this film. I was expecting Phasma to be developed in this film but they have completely wasted her character (and a great actress). Snoke is given no development and by the end of this movie it is made clear he is no threat to anyone. Another problem is the blatant disregard of any of the rules that have been established throughout a franchise's CANON timeline spanning 6 movies and 2 entire animates series. In any Sci-Fi and Fantasy there is room for a little adjustment here and there\\, but this movie completely ignores it to the point you wonder whether anyone involved has ever actually watched the other Star Wars movies\/series. One of the major things I was hoping to see in this movie was why Rey is so powerful\\, and who Snoke is and how he became so powerful. As it turns out\\, it seems in the new canon people are powerful simply \\\"Because\\\". Kylo Ren has trained under Luke Skywalker for years\\, and then been trained by Snoke for many more\\, yet somehow Rey\\, with no training AT ALL\\, bests him in a fight the first time fights with a lightsaber. I was expecting some sort of explanation\\, but it looks like we won't get one. Snoke\\, still just an evil man in evil clothes. He's powerful because he's the bad guy. Another category of inconsistencies I can summaries is the lack of technical thought put into each scene. Lightspeed tricks that would render Episodes 4\\, 6 and 7 completely redundant. Scenes where everyone should be sucked out into the vacuum of space but somehow aren't. Bombs that \\\"fall\\\" in space. Characters that you think are in one place suddenly appearing in another making the assumption that we are fine with just \\\"assuming they must have escaped then?\\\". Droids being designed with \\\"slot machine coin\\\" firing mechanisms. It's just ridiculous.\\nFinally\\, and I can't say much about this due to spoilers\\, but the way they treat Luke Skywalker and Leia in this movie is just outright disrespectful. Luke Skywalkers character in this is another person entirely from the original movies. Different set of morals\\, completely different personality\\, and they seem to completely disregard any character growth and experiences from the original movies when deciding how he will act in TLJ. Leia's character for the most part is solid\\, but she is subject to the single most ludicrous\\, accidentally comical scene in this entire movie\\, and considering she has little affect on the remainder of the story\\, I'm shocked they stuck with this considering the actor Carrie Fisher sadly died.\\n\\nOverall\\, as a lifelong Star Wars fan I would suggest steering clear of this movie and the rest of this new trilogy unless you want to be severely disappointed. And for everyone else who is not a lifelong Star Wars fan\\, I would steer clear of it\\, if for no other reason that it is simply a badly written\\, badly directed movie.","true":true}
