Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I remember Star Wars when it actually made sense and was good. This movie just makes no sense in how they try to portray developed characters! Mark Hamill even said he didn't like Luke's role in the film and wasn't very fitting with the character. I 100% AGREE! Another issue is *SPOILER* what the hell was up with Leia just flying through space? Also when they opened the airlock and let her float on through how did no one else get sucked out into space? The story was lacking in common sense and moves farther away from the series that everyone wanted to see again. I wouldn't watch it again unless I was being payed. Should've let the series end at episode 6 man...","true":true}
