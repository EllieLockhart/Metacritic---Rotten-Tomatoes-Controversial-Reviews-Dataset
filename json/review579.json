It has some crazy gore and effects that compliment the graphics beautifully. Speaking of beautiful\\, the butterfly effect is one of the most deep and interesting features I have used. It is a quirky and funny teen horror movie that's silliness do nothing but help it. This game is nothing what I expected because I did not expect a lot. This game blew ALL my expectations out of the water and is an amazing game. I believe everybody should experience this game at least once in their life time because it is a treat to play and watch unfold. Supermassive games has one hell of a game\/franchise on their hands and I hope to see more from them. Until is one of the best games this year\\, deserving a perfect score of 10\u2026 Expand","true":true}
