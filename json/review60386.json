The gameplay feels smooth and adds a few layers to what we saw in the first game\\, but still sticks to its structure of \\\"Find your way from point A to point B while dealing with enemies and gathering resources\\\" with a few storyline sections sprinkled in with objects to interact with and snippets of conversations to have with your companions. They also took the lessons they learned from \\\"Uncharted: The Lost Legacy\\\" and added quite a few large open areas to explore filled with loads of optional collectibles\\, puzzles and story tidbits. Funnily enough\\, the game also has set pieces on par with the Uncharted series\\, despite this game's subtler storytelling.\r\rSpeaking of which... One of the best elements of Naughty Dog's games are their stories\\, and The Last of Us had their best story to date. In Part 2 the team made some very risky choices which clearly haven't gone down well with many fans.\rThe game's main theme is the endless cycle of violence the main characters find themselves in and how hard it is for them to break out of. Sadly\\, this is obvious from very early on in the game\\, meaning at least the first half of the plot becomes extremely predictable (and at some specific moments\\, strangely anticlimactic). Then the game throws a twist at us clearly meant to make us empathise with a particular character\\, and though at first it felt jarring\\, they did eventually manage to sell me on the idea.\rIt's a strange feeling\\, knowing that your characters are making bad decisions and forcing you to go along with them\\, knowing the best thing you could do for these people is to stop playing. Mashing the \\\"attack\\\" button and thinking \\\"I don't want to do this... Stop making me do this.\\\" It's a feeling few games have given me and yet this game took it to the limit. Is that good? It didn't feel good. Maybe that was the point\\, but if so... is it an experience I want to have? As the credits rolled I was satisfied with how the story played out overall\\, but I did feel conflicted in many ways. It was probably a few hours too long and could've done with some additional editing. The gameplay loop also became repetitive hours before it was done. That being said\\, I applaud Naughty Dog for taking risks\\, even if they didn't all work out too well.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
