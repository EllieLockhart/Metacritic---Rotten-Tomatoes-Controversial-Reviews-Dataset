Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Is this Star Wars? Or a Marvel\/Hunger Games knockoff?? The plot is recycled\\, slow\\, and jumbled . The symbolism is forced. It gives you the\\, \\\"um why are they doing that now?\\\" feeling the whole movie. Nothing is seamless. They misused the most interesting\\, embattled character (Luke). And when they did use him\\, he was only there in spirit. The light saber battles are few and forgettable. Star Wars and Star Wars fans deserve better. Hopefully the next installment does the series justice\\, this one did not.","true":true}
