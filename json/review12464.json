Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can not describe in words the feeling of disappointment and anguish that this movie caused in me. I started watching Star Wars with and because of my father\\, and just thinking that a new trilogy would be made in time to us to see it together in the theaters was one of the best fellings in the world.\\n\\nAfter a so well directed and written Episode VII\\, after all the story and characters that Abrams built and introduced\\, after all that\\, everything was murdered\\, all the old characters were murdered\\, all new ones were murdered\\, all the lore and care was murdered and all this covered by a disgraceful and silly humor that made the scenes\\, which had no weight at all\\, impossible to watch or be taken seriously. \\n\\nAt least the prequels have introduce characters such as Qui-Gon Jinn\\, Darth Maul\\, Young Ben\\, Count Dooku and Grievous who have had better and more impactful use on the screen and in history as a whole. And to think that this movie with all that build up\\, manage to be worst that all before it.\\n\\nIt is incredible how Disney managed to go from so high to so low from one film to another\\, do not let Rian Johnson touch on this franchise again\\, or any script and history for that matter\\, unless the film is shot on the moon\\, and he stay there.\\n\\nUnf*kingbelievable.","true":true}
