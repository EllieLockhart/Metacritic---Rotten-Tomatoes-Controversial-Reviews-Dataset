Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So unbelievably disappointed with TLJ. Yeah it was full of excitement\\, battles\\, storylines\\, but none of the storylines were good.

So much emotion was tied up in Luke Skywalker and it was tossed away with a force projection demise? Very weak. It seems the last Jedi is really dead with this film. Be ashamed\\, Rian Johnson...","true":true}
