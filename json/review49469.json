Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Would give it a 0 if I could. I liked all the movies up until this one (including the prequels and Episode VII)\\, but this an incoherent\\, awful mess that irreparably ruins the Star Wars Universe. I felt genuinely depressed after watching this drivel but now I simply don't care. Childhood shat on. I will never watch another another Disney Star Wars Movie. ","true":true}
