Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There isn't much I can add that hasn't been said here already.  I just find it awfully suspect that the professional critics gave this terrible movie 91%.  I guess in this day and age of fake news\\, we can include fake reviews.\\n\\nBTW\\, this movie was a real clunker.  I really didn't care for any of it.  Poorly fleshed characters\\, bad jokes and lack of continuity made this a really long and disappointing movie.","true":true}
