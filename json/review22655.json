Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Liked some elements of it but the corny Disney humor\\, the Leia in Space \/ Marry Poppins scene was ridiculous. I believe that a couple of hardcore fans like myself advising a director\\, working with them\\, would be much\\, much more effective than executives saying what can be in a film.","true":true}
