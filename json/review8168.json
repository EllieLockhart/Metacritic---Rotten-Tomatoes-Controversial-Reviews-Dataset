Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic Movie fun filled and returned to the Star Wars Franchise.   The ones that are giving the movie bad movie reviews are in a group who does not stand for Disney beliefs and are  Review bombing the reviews on this movie and other movies.  Those people have not seen the movie and all their reviews are not important enough to the casual reviewer a lot of the stuff said in the reviews are made up to dis credit the movie. They did this with a number of movies that belong to the Disney Family like Marvel Movies\\, Star Wars etc.  So the negative reviews have no credit or merit to them.  I highly recommend this film for the family to watch for fun and adventure.","true":true}
