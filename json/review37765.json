Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were 2 main jobs here. \\n1)Do not screw up the character of Luke Skywalker.\\n2)Give Rey the much needed character development she deserves.\\nNot only did they screw up both of these points\\, they screwed up basically everything but the CGI. \\nIn this horrible movie you will meet Luke \\\"Get off my Lawn\\\" Skywalker and Rey \\\"Mary Sue\\\".  In Disney's Star Wars you can become a Jedi without even wanting to\\, kind of stumbling into it really. It seems that a couple lessons will take you there. Are the lessons long and complex you ask? Maybe\\, if you are pre-schooler is my response. Perhaps\\, you do have the attention span of a pre-schooler. \\n\\nWe didn't even get a freaking light saber duel.","true":true}
