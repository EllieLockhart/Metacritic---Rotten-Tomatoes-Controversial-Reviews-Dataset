Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"LOL.  Look at all the triggered snowflake alt-right cucks giving this movie 1 star.  They're all the same with their homogenized whining about SJW and crying about how Rey is a Mary Sue.  \\n\\nIf Luke\\, Obi-Wan\\, and Yoda were real\\, they would strike you down with their light sabers because you're the dark side.  \\n\\nOh\\, and this movie made over $1.3 Billion\\, so you can post all the 1 star\\, 1\/2 star\\, or 0 star reviews you want\\, it doesn't matter at all.","true":true}
