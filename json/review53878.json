Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best Star Wars movie since Empire Strikes Back.\\n\\nDon't come into this movie expecting theories to turn into realities. If you have a favorite side character\\, don't expect them to be the new Big Deal. Han is just going to laugh at you. The movie subverts expectations and while it has some slight missteps in the pacing\\, the story and the message explode onto the screen with the best visuals and audio of any Star Wars movie to-date.","true":true}
