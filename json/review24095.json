Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Massive plot holes\\, terrible jokes\\, the make Mark Hamill look like an idiot\\, Rey doesn't need training as she is too perfect. Poe and Rose go on a pointless adventure that really has nothing to do with the story\\, space fuel has never been an issue until now of coarse\\, and nothing has happen since the last movie because the writers have no imagination. Snoke is an interesting sith lord and so is his background\\, but who cares about that. Who cares about Reys origin too. Remember Admiral Akbar? Clearly he doesnt matter either\\, and yes leah has full capabilities of the force regardless of logic","true":true}
