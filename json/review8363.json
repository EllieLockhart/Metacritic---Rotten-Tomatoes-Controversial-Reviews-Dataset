Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Felt like it started off strong\\, then not so good\\, then ended strong. SPOILER ALERT **** YODA was probably my favorite part. But Luke throwing the lightsaber ? Leia floating back to the ship? Just felt weird and awkward. A lot of things felt out of place. Wouldn\u2019t be a movie I can or want to watch multiple times a year ","true":true}
