Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved the movie\\, it was inspiring and surprising. Loved the fact that they actually made the characters human and not flawless heroes\\, everyone can make a mistake. It's not a fairytale\\, let's leave them to the kids. Even the mighty Luke Skywalker get's scared and makes mistakes\\, and young heroes like Poe\\, Rey and Finn must grow up and learn before leading a rebellion. It's an actual movie\\, that gives a new perspective on the characters we love\\, and I as a Fan (with capital letters 'cause I saw the movies countless times and read some of the novels) appreciate it maybe more than the others. And for the riot that made also a petition to remake the movie\\, you should read again the books about the old trilogy (spoiler: Luke is very human and just a normal guy\\, not some flawless god).","true":true}
