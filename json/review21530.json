Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would recommend waiting for this movie to come out on Netflix. It is clear that Disney has decided to use absolutely no creativity in making this movie\\, and to be honest the plot does not make sense. The political situation and setting does not make sense and is completely detached from the original series. Everything that the Force Awakens leaves unanswered and that optimists thought would be answered in this movie\\, like why is everything happening and who is Snoke\\, this movie proves Disney does not have an answer to. Everything exists to push the plot along. This movie is not a coherent narrative set in an interesting world building on the original series\\, this movie is a hodge podge of ideas with no sense of how to make an interesting story. Every time the movie builds to a climax\\, we are left disappointed as all the foreshadowing of the previous scenes proves completely unrelated to the direction of the film.","true":true}
