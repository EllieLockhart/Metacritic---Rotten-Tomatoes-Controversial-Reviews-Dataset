Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved this film.  The characters relationships evolved in surprising ways.  There was plenty of action\\, plenty of humour and the story arcs coincided at a nice pace through the film. A large climax in the middle of the film kept meant that even though the film was long it left you wanting more at the end.  I will defiantly watch again.","true":true}
