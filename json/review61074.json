The characterization and its interactions that made TLOU1's story so endearing are all gone. It used to be a story about finding happiness in a post-apocalyptic setting\\, and now it's just your run-of-the-mill\\, poorly written revenge story. Every single event (apart from Joel-Ellie related flashbacks) felt unsatisfying\\, especially the 2nd part of the game where you're forced to play as one of the new characters\\, Abby\\, just to make her seem somewhat lovable. Her story and interactions are so awful it only made me hate her more. How can you be that bad at character development...The game culminated in one of the worst\\, poorly written\\, least satisfying endings I've ever gotten to see. This game is a hard pass for any fan of TLOU1\\, or well\\, anyone for that matter.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
