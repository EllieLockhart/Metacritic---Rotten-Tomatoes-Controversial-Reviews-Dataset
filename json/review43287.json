Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a fantastic middle chapter to the trilogy\\, showing fallible characters who are forced to learn from their mistakes. Character development was given both to the protagonists and to the villain\\, while other characters were allowed to serve their purpose and then fade into the background. I am only sad that after the build-up of Leia's character in this film\\, we will be unable to see that paid off in the final film of the trilogy.","true":true}
