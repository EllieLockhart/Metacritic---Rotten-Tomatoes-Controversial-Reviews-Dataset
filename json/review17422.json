Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw the movie on the opening weekend and thought it was an excellent movie. Then i started to read the viewers reviews and was wondering if they saw the same movie that i did? As i read more i saw a something common among the bad reviews\\, Rian Johnson. The Star Wars fans seem to hate him to the point that they will bash a good movie to hurt him. I think if you just watch the movie without bias for the director you will enjoy it! Is the movie perfect\\, no\\, but what movie is. Every movie has plot holes and flaws\\, if you look past them you will find an excellent movie. I suggest you see it again without the bias you have for the director.","true":true}
