Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was it the hype and anticipation that let me down? I left this movie with more questions than I wanted. And the Disney humor doesn\u2019t belong in this universe. I don\u2019t mind the humor. I don\u2019t think the Disney humor is needed. If you saw the movie then you know what I\u2019m talking about. This movie had so many twist and turns that just led to nowhere. The feeling I got from this movie is the same feeling I got after watching The Force Awakens. A feeling of I\u2019ve seen this before just done differently. TFA I give it a pass of mirroring A New Hope for the sake of cleansing our palette from Episodes 1-3. However there was no reason to do the same for this one. I know this reads as a very negative review. But Star Wars for me was always about hope against difficult odds. And this one just felt so flat almost like trudging through mud with no sense of hope. ","true":true}
