Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall\\, the originality of the movie over The Force Awakens was a winning move for me. I didn\u2019t enjoy the paths taken for Finn and Rey and it felt like a missed opportunity - Finn became a fully-throwaway side character\\, and Rey\u2019s personality is never developed. Rey needed a few monologues of her own - often the movie was just happening around her and it was just assumed how she would respond without knowing what she was really thinking- a blanket hero is boring. The cinematography\\, and the bravery of the plot were both elite though\\, and trump some of the other choices. The movies has to please a young audience as well as old\\, and for a director to juggle that requires some compromise in tone and focus. Rian Johnson had a much bigger challenge to succeed in that task because he was shocking the audience more with plot twists compared to TFA\\, which had taken The New Hope\u2019s frame and re-wrote it for a new protagonist (Rey instead of Luke). To get 5 stars however\\, to recap\\, I needed to hear from Rey more about her inner monologue of thoughts so that I would care more about her journey. ","true":true}
