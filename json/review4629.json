Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"como pelicula independiente estaria entretenida\\, pero como pelicula que forma parte de la saga de star wars es terriblenete mala y contradicitoria con todo lo que ya se habia constrido anterior mente dando al fan una sensacion de malestar con lo que estan haciento a esta franquicia.\\ncon esta pelicula la franquicia star wasr esta muerta definitivamente.","true":false}
