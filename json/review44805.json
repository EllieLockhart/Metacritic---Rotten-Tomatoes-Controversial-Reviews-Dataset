Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Truly aweful! I loved Star Wars but this travisty doesn't deserve to carry that beloved name. No wonder Mark Hamilton hates the new trilogy!\\n\\nIf you love Star Wars don't go see this crap\\, they won't make better shows until we stand up to them!","true":true}
