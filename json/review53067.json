Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As perfect as a mass appeal movie can be. Putting aside some logic and science errors like gravity in space and odd star destroyer behaviour\\, etc.\\, the plot and certain morale undertones were very well conceived. It\u2019s a unique and fresh revival of the Star Wars universe and the concept of the Force. With the exception of the lack of dark and light combining forces by the end of the film\\, the storyline was near flawless. Visuals were breathtaking. One of the best Star Wars filmed ever.","true":true}
