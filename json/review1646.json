Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a movie 6\/10 As a Star Wars story 3\/10 It was whimsical and disappointing. It looked and sounded a bit like Star Wars but it was missing the serious... it\u2019s like the creative choices for story we\u2019re all the opposite of what a Star Wars story would be","true":true}
