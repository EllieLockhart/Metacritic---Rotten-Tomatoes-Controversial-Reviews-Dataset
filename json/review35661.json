Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is an Great standalone movie but comparing it to the original trilogy and force awakens\\, it just removes all character development\\, theories\\, plots and questions from those movies. In the words of Mark Hammill \\\"He's just not my Luke Skywalker\\\" and they just ruined the magic from episode 7. I liked kylo ren in the movie but I am disappointed how the new director just gave questions simple and boring answers that don't make sense or throw the question and answer out the window. All and all I just hope episode 9 can resurrect the magic from episode 7 and fix the mistakes from episode 8 answering some of the burning questions including the knights of ren\\, resolve the Rey's parents plot while them not being nobody's and return Luke to his old self through conventional means like his force ghost.","true":true}
