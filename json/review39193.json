Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film absolutely destroyed my childhood. Ive loved Star Wars all my life and even defended the prequels granted Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones werent great but they both had good moments. This has nothing. It turned Luke into a joke. It made Rey's back story and images from the Force Awakens pointless. What the hell was Leia flying through space?!? They even made the Yoda cameo bad (lightning\\, really?!?) \\nThe 2 sub plot's with Finn and Poe are poorly written and end up being completely pointless and you dont even get to see Luke have 1 lightsaber fight. His death is a shambles. He seemingly has the power to create a force ghost to trick Kylo Ren then I guess dies from exhaution? I am so disappointed with how this movie has been made.","true":true}
