Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson took a risk and he failed.This movie is better than the prequels but not as good as Empire\\,ROT or TFA. Ultimately the movie has some original ideas but who was asking for new force powers?The movie was too long mostly do to the introduction of an unnecessary casino planet\/master code breaker subplot.","true":true}
