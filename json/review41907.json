Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie Is visually stunning  and has many great parts. It's a good stand alone film but an awful Movie in the Star Wars Universe! It gives the middle finger to everything that happens between episodes 1-7. It also completely dishonors Luke Skywalker. Don't get me wrong this is not a bad made movie. If u like the play book thrown out u will like it. If u like staying true to the past you will not like it. This movie also hates on men and has many political statements in it that I don't feel belong in Star Wars but that's me. (Eat the bird Chue). Many Seens that were funny had a pulitical tone to them. If this movie stayed true to the bast on people behavior it would of been a 10\/10.","true":true}
