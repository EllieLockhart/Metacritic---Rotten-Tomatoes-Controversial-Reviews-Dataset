Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not sure what planet the critics were on but it must have been in a galaxy far far away from the fans. Wanted to love it\\, had huge hope after reading first reviews... came away disappointed. The only satisfying ending was Carrie's exit. No one has managed to capture the magic of the original trilogy yet. Abrams came close. Just sorry Mark Hamill didn't get what wanted. Here's one 70's fan who came away more sad than anything really. Which character to screw with next... watch your back Chewie.","true":true}
