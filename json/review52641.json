Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"all i see is people crying about a great movie\\, I dont know what movie you all saw\\, this movie was great granted it had a few ham fist moments\\, face it you all got on that hype train and road it right into disappointment town. and its your own damn fault. you put this movie in such an unattainable place then when it fell short of it you took to shirting on it rather than enjoying it.  I hope you can learn for this.","true":true}
