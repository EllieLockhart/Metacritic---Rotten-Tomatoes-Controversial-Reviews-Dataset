Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm so glad that Rian Johnson was able ot shut down so many fan theories and do the unexpected. This movie takes the saga in a quite different path in a way that refreshes itself and leaves the next episode free to finish a story in\\, I hope the most character-driven and spectacular way that we all know Abrams is capable of delivering.","true":true}
