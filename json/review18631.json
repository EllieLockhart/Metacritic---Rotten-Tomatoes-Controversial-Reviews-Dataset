Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It must be tough to deliver under such immense anticipation. 91% feels way too high. The tone was confusing and the story was kind of a mess. It almost felt like a bad Star Wars parody at times. There were a couple of great things\\, and they were truly great\\, but overall it was a disappointment. The Force Awakens and Rogue One were deserving of their acclaim. This is not. Hopefully the next one gets back on track.","true":true}
