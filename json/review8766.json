Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Force awakens had its flaws\\, but created something great and did a great job of introducing new characters (could have developed ray better instead of making her automatically god). TLJ Just destroyed everything the last jedi created with a bunch of meaningless subplots. I felt no attachment to characters. It was laughable. Purple haired lady just made everything so much worse. awful movie I have no idea how JJ Abrams is going to be able to fix this. Good special effects though\\, kinda entertaining once you just start laughing at it.","true":true}
