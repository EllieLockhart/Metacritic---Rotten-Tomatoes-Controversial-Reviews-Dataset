Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was unpredictable\\, beautiful\\, took many risks and was funny too. Sure it was weird sometimes but it was just refreshing. One of the best\\, if not the best Star Wars movie yet. Embrace it\\, feel it\\, then you will enjoy it. Loved it\\, may the force  be with you!","true":true}
