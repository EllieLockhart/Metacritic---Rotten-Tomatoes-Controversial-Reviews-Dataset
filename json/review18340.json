Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this was a better film than TFA but still not worth watching. Again\\, it's an insult to fans of the Star Wars movies pre-disney. No depth\\, flashy visuals (but that is to be expected when you just dump a pile of money on a movie) bad story\\, numerous plot holes and not enjoyable to watch.","true":true}
