Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a sw movie but rian johnson's vision (which sucks) aka rian has no johnson\\, cause kk ripped it off him just like they ripped off lukes! Aka jake skywalker\\, the only good thing i can say about this movie is VISUALLY it's amazing!! otherwise it sucks sjw @$$ i was part of the solo boycott and will continue to boycott all lucasfilms movies\/toys\/ect ..TLJ (the last joke) (the last jerk) (the last johnson) ps shame on you lucasfilms for lashing out against your own customers and shame on you disney for allowing it!!","true":true}
