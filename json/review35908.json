Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi it is not a good STAR WARS movie - the story arcs were very disappointing and often seemed unnecessarily defeatist. I left the theater feeling numb and the movie really seemed to have 'no soul'.\\n\\nIt's one thing to introduce new ideas and to shake up the story line but the way things were 'shaken up' for many characters seemed needlessly nihilistic and in almost all cases leaned towards the most undesirable\/negative outcomes possible.  \\n\\nUntil now Star Wars has been a saga of hope - including The Empire Strikes Back (Battle of Hoth\\, Han Solo in the Asteroids\\, Lando recovering his senses\\, Leia rescuing Luke from an apparently hopeless situation) - but this movie leaves one with very little or none of this kind of hope.\\n\\nFor example\\, why take Luke Skywalker - the iconic and stalwart bastion of faith\\, hope\\, fairness and moderation against a 'real world' that so often robs people of these ideals and transform him into a despairing negativistic recluse?  Why turn a movie hero who has inspired so many into just another sardonic portrayer of the sad state of the human condition?   Sure\\, this kind of despair happens to a lot of people over a hard lifetime but why devolve the one-time savior of the galaxy whose character has inspired so many of these same life-hardened people into a cynical and beaten person who seems to discredit any hope that higher ideals can sustain even the most pain-filled soul?\\n\\nAnd why turn Princess Leia - the fiery and endlessly driven 'can do' heroine who always finds a way becomes an overly pensive\\, uncharacteristically conservative\\, dispirited 'go through the motions' leader hoping against hope to just hold-the-fort together? Why turn this great movie heroine from a 'never say die' firebrand into a disappointed\\, vanquished unfortunate forlornly handing the reins to Poe?  What a disservice to the greatest heroine I've known.\\n\\nSo\\, why?  I'm pretty sure the idea was to paint a picture of a galaxy facing formidable odds to be overcome in the final movie.  It's a proven trilogy strategy.\\n\\nSo\\, how?  The original movies\\, which are still arguably the best of the lot\\, created the sense of formidable odds by disrupting any sense of stability in the plights of the characters\\, not in the characters themselves who remained true throughout all the disruption and uncertainties. In contrast\\, this movie attempts to disrupt by creating character arcs that suggest their greatest accomplishments and noblest drives only lead to fleeting successes followed by hopelessness and despair?\\n\\nI'm pretty sure the 'undermine the characters' approach will prove strategically flawed.\\n\\nThe Star Wars story has always helped people\\, children and adults alike\\, to have hope in the face of an ever-more apparently Orwellian world.  It achieved this in part by touching upon the tragedies of the human condition while focusing on the rewards of a more mythological idealism.  \\n\\nThe Last Jedi seems to reverse this formula\\, focusing on the tragic which already saturates the modern world view while only hinting that noble ideas can overcome.  Worse\\, it does nothing to punish wrong action on the part of despicable characters\\, but rewards the unrepentant betrayer and seems to delight in emphasizing the cost of callous self-service to undeserving heroes.\\n\\nThis is not a story of hope in the Star Wars tradition but a story of hopelessness in the face of the unfairness of the world.  It is not at all what anyone has come to expect and appreciate from the retelling of the hero's journey that is Star Wars.  And it betrays a lack of true understanding of the essence of the Monomyth.\\n\\nWhen so many fans hoped for the boost in spirit this epic chronicle has always provided\\, even in its least spectacular chapters\\, we received instead a discouraging blow undermining our faith that positive and enduring spiritual riches come to those who complete their heroes' journeys.  \\n\\nI suspect even Joseph Campbell would find it hard to see what boons this story arc would give the hero completing her journey to return to society.\\n\\nOther than that\\, as a plain old movie\\, it was OK\\, kind of long\\, with sophomoric dialogue and humor\\, mundane sexual innuendo\\, some nonsensical subplots\\, plodding where it might have built tension and a storyline that seemed somewhat disjointed.  Not sure how the pundits came up with such a high score for it but perhaps they have esoteric methods of legitimate evaluation I simply don't understand.\\n\\nAs a STAR WARS movie:  Grade F.  The worst of them all.  One decent lightsaber battle. Pity - it had so much potential.\\n\\nAs a plain-old movie: Grade B-.  Good cinematography and special effects. Wouldn't pay a theater to see it again but may stream if none of the many much better sci-fi movies are available.","true":true}
