Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worth the wait\\, although the subplots with the resistance and code breaker etc. could have been trimmed with only positives in terms of running time and the focus staying on what's interesting (kylo\\, rey and luke). \\n\\nSide note: the fact that many 'fans' are throwing their toys out of the pram about this film is hilarious. Stick to the status quo\\, get trashed. Take some risks\\, get trashed. The fundamental misunderstanding of the characterisation of kylo ren specifically is the most baffling....yet understandable I suppose. Those saying they're 'cringing' at him and other reductive criticism are those who probably are reminded of themselves in him\\, and so would never see themselves as the villain (I don't want to say young white males but I'm saying young white males)...how perfectly ironic that these films are trying to teach a lesson they're insistent on ignoring.","true":true}
