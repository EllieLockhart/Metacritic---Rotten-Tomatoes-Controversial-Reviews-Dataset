Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing it and trying desperately hard to like it\\, after 24 hours of thinking it through the film is very disappointing. Twists are thrown in every 2 seconds and feel pointless - trying too hard. Too much going on\\, unnecessary casino CGI action scene that felt more like it belonged to the awful prequels\\, but most unforgivably is having Luke become a character you couldn't like anymore. All the hard work done in Force Awakens has been undone here. JJ got it spot on with Episode 7\\, but this director didn't have a clue what Star Wars is really all about. How the critics are fawning over this beats me. I reckon once the dust has settled they will all reach the same conclusion as the viewing public. This is a poor film that has taken the franchise back to the dark ages of the prequels again.","true":true}
