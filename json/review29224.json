Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Replace \\\"STAR WARS\\\" with \\\"SHIT WARS\\\" and you will be overjoyed with the outcome of this movie.\\n\\nRemember guys its Disney here\\, and its all about the magic shits and giggles.\\n\\nIt was a fantastic film and definitely deserved the praise it got from all the well renowned movie critics. Sheesh they need to pay for all those 1st class plane tickets somehow!","true":true}
