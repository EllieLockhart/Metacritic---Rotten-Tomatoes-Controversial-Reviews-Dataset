Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's not the film we were expecting\\, or the film that we deserved (entitled fan\\, I know) but it is a vital installment to the saga and as a huge fan I'm excited to see where the next one takes us with our newly developed characters. #snokelives #reyisapalpatine","true":true}
