Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it. Saw it Friday with my parents. My mom has only seen Star Wars and the Empire Strikes Back\\, to her\\, it was meh. My dad and I have seen them all and saw Rogue One together as well. He and I loved it.\\n\\nThe thing I loved most about it was seeing Carrie Fisher. \\n\\nI also liked the complexity of the relationships. \\n\\nPlanning to see it again on the 25th and hoping to do the IMAX to see the difference (dad can't see 3D so we went for a more classic movie presentation) and to catch the things I missed in the first go around because I was too focused on seeing Carrie Fisher on the screen. \\n\\nOne thing I can say to folks wanting to see it\\, this movie feels like it was written and directed by someone who loved Star Wars as a story. As an overall over arching storyline. This was written as if to fleshout something long dreamed or long played out in the head of a true fan of Star Wars (original 3). \\n\\nSo\\, don't listen to the naysayers\\, instead\\, make up your own mind. I found it in keeping with the originals for storytelling.","true":true}
