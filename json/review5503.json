Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Destroyed the Sequel Trilogy\\, period. And my real problem with the movie is neither the character arc of Luke Skywalker nor the impressive power of Rey and not even the blatant pushing of political agendas. My problem is the complete ignorance of everything JJ Abrams set up in Episode 7 and even the rules of that universe far away themselves\\, resulting in major plotholes and a total absence of logic. Would it have been enjoyable as a standalone movie? Probably not but I really can't tell. I just know that as the eight episode in a over 30 year old franchise it was a total failure. It got me from overly hyped to utterly desinterested.","true":true}
