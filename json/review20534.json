Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"I've got a bad feeling about this\\\" would be an understatement in summarizing episode 8. This movie is an anticlimactic disappointment with a pointless main story line and pointless side stories. The answers to questions from the previous installment in this series are neglected or answered in a most disappointing way.  Treatment of the most iconic Star Wars characters are unjust and not fitting to the original triology.","true":true}
