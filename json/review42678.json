Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was extremely flawed and disappointing\\, to the point that star wars will never be the same ever again. It's different but different in a bad way\\, I would suggest not seeing it. If you do end up seeing the movie listen to the silence and notice the odd feeling around you as you leave the theater.","true":true}
