Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is an average movie for the Star Wars Saga. Instead of leaving the story of TFA to simmer for a bit in terms of the plot\\, it picks up right where it left off\\, which isn't this film or Rian Johnson's fault\\, but is victim to the ending of TFA which leaves Rey handing the lightsaber to Luke. Some of the details in the plot are almost becoming cliche for the series. The movie right away starts with something the characters have to blow up\\, similar to the Death Stars from the originals. However\\, this detail just seems to be used to develop the real plot of the movie. That was just one example that I could reveal without giving away the plot\\, but if you've seen the movie\\, you probably know what I'm talking about. Another minor problem with the writing involves the unnecessary humor that was thrown in. The humor is put into parts of the movie that are meant to be the \\\"meat\\\" of the movie in which the audience is supposed to be kept on the edge of their seats. Going back and watching The Force Awakens and even Rogue One\\, I felt anxious to know how in the world the characters are going to pull off some epic plan against the baddies\\, but The Last Jedi makes it hard for the film to take itself seriously with all the jokes. Some of the plot lines are wrapped up in a somewhat unsatisfying fashion\\, as you might look back and see how shallow the story was with key details regarding the lore. In terms of how critical this movie was the the Star Wars Saga\\, it was huge. It may leave you wondering afterwards\\, \\\"how in the world will the rest of this trilogy be concluded in just one more movie?\\\" The plot alone will make this a must-watch for diehard Star Wars.","true":true}
