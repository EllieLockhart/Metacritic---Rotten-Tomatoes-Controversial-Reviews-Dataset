Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One word best describes this movie-disappointing.  Yes\\, it can be difficult to make a Star Wars movies that wows everyone.  I personally thought the Force Awakens was pretty good\\, and it did what it had to do...open interesting story lines and introduce interesting new characters while remaining anchored to the originals.  This movie uses lazy writing and cheap gags to accomplish none of that.  The new directions and twists are not \\\"refreshing\\\"\\, they are throwaway excuses for lazy storytelling.  Many others have listed numerous reasons why this movie missed so many plot elements and character development\\, and they are correct.  This is an okay movie with some good acting (considering the material) and visuals. but it does not have the heart and soul of Star Wars and will probably leave most thinking people feeling empty and disappointed.   It's too bad\\, because there was a whole treasure trove of material that could have been epic.","true":true}
