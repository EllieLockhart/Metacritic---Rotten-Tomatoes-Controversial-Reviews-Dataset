Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film itself is good\\, however it did not feel like a Star Wars film. The story was in fact very good but would have served better as a spin off movie featuring a different set of characters. The killing of Snoke felt very unfulfilling and the lack of a proper light saber duel was a let down. The Praetorian Guard sequence was awesome and very well performed and in my opinion the best sequence of the movie. The comedy moments were in my opinion\\, very cringe worthy and were worse than cracker jokes. I just didn't like the movie as a Star Wars film\\, if i was new to the franchise my opinion would probably be different however the build up was like the build up to Christmas\\, a huge commercial build up for a load of crap.","true":true}
