Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am so glad I am not the only one to not like this movie. I was so disappointed. Are the critics being bought or have they never seen a Star Wars movie before? At least this movie answers the question; what happens if Empire and Jedi were one movie. Wait... no one ever asked that question\\, so why did they supply us with an answer. I cannot express how bad this movie is and how upset I am because of it. Did anyone except me expect the code breaker to be Lando? What a missed opportunity. Such a mess!","true":true}
