Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force Awakens creates potential with interesting characters\\, lore\\, and mystery. But Rian Johnson took over with The Last Jedi and it falls flat. There is no substance to this movie. It\u2019s boring and dumb.","true":true}
