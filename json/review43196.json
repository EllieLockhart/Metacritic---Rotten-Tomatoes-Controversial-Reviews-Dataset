Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This star war movie is the worst I'd ever seen. The story hasn't even been told in a smooth way. Also\\, the personality of Luke is totally different from the previous movies. There are scenes in the movie are ridiculous(Leia using the force to get back to the ship\\, she's not a Jedi for god sake). Fans really want a good story and exciting lightsaber fighting scenes. For critics\\, please stop writing nonsense for money\\, and making comments of the movie should not involve 'so called rights'(human rights and stuff). This is a movie\\, not politics. Personally\\, I love human rights and love to protect it. However\\, movies are art\\, it should not involve any politics. Otherwise\\, why don't we just watch Martin Luther King's speech over and over again(this is a movie for  entertainment\\, not Oscar)? This is also for film makers. Also\\, stop fool fans with movies making money. This is a huge insult for star wars and for Luke\\, the character. Even Mark Hamill disagrees with his own character. If Disney is keep making this kinda disappointing movies\\, I won't watch Star Wars anymore.","true":true}
