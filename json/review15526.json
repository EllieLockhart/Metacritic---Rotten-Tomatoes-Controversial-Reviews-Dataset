Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it. This isn't your grandfathers Star Wars. This is the start of a brand new saga. All you fan boys are upset because you guessed wrong about all your theories and now they are basically starting over. It was a nice break from the Skywalker saga. Can't wait for Episode 9.","true":true}
