Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's not a typical Star Wars movie. It doesn't give the fans anything that they expected or wanted out of a second installment to this trilogy. The director and producers were more interested in pushing an ideological\/political agenda than in building characters and telling a good story. Very disappointed\\, and an opportunity to make Luke shine completely lost. I loved The Force Awakens\\, but after watching The Last Jedi I don't even care what happens in episode 9.","true":true}
