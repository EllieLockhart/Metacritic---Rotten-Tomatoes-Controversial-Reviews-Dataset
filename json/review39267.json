Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film has had the most meat for me of any of the franchise so far. I have enjoyed them all for the mythical scale story and the drama and excitement\\, but so far this one is up there in my theatregoing life.","true":true}
