Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't want to say this but I must say it: This is the worst Star Wars movie ever! I'm a big fan\\, and after 30 minutes I already knew that it was going to be a disaster. So disappointed! This is the Terminator 3 for Star Wars. This is the Crystal Skull for Indiana Jones. This is the Episode I for the new trilogy. The script is so lame\\, full of non-sense stories\\, fake romanticism\\, fake heroism\\, and fake Force! The acting was poor\\, like a bunch of non-Star Wars Fans making fun of Star Wars. They destroyed completely the true meaning of Star Wars. I wished that there were a huge CTRL-Z button for this movie.","true":true}
