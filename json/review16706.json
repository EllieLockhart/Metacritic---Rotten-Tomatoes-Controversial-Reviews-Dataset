Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I never thought I would long for the days of the prequels\\, but here we are. I can't for the life of me understand how 91% of \\\"critics\\\" thought this wasn't a huge waste of time. Audiences have it right - this movie is terrible. Granted\\, the cinematography is amazing. I mostly enjoyed the scenes with \\\"Luke\\\"\\, simply because Hamill delivered the performance of his career. although I agree with him and everyone else who says this film was a huge disservice to the character. Everyone who says it was original is stupid. (Rebel base discovered\\, which leads to a long chase through space\\, where a scoundrel betrays our heroes\\, while the young protagonist gets trained by a wise old Jedi culminating in a duel with the Bad Guy who makes a big reveal. Uhg - seriously?) An hour could have been cut by eliminating the absurd\\, tedious\\, side-plot. ( I nearly fell asleep - that's a first.) Johnson is an ass for not following JJ's Abrams lead\\, but it does beg the question -did they ever have a plan for these movies at all or is this simply a multi-million dollar game of cinematic telephone?Lucas may be a terrible director\/ writer\\, but he's an incredible ideas guy - he probably should have been listened to from the beginning as far as an original story. Ultimately\\, this trilogy can not be fixed\\, no matter what they end up doing with IX. (Maybe a scene where Luke wakes up and it was all a bad dream? I'd happily take that.)","true":true}
