Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you think this movie is good\\, either you haven't seen the force awakens\\, or you just like seeing characters and visually pleasing cinematography. This movie was poorly written and it ruined all of the characters we know and love. This movie had pointless deaths and repetitive jokes that weren't funny and poorly used. Fin and Roses adventure sucks. Leias force powers WTF. Luke's a grumpy asshole\\, again WTF. Yodas face was flatter than usual\\, and everything in the end of this movie meant jack. Rian Johnson's interpretation of Star Wars sucked. How are they going to fix this\\, lol\\, good luck JJ!","true":true}
