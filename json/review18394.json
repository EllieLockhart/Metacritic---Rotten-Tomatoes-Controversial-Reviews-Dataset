Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is a good movie outside of and in the Star Wars universe. It's a logical and challenging progression to the story we all know and love. It moves away from the tropes of the past two trilogies to include new and exciting directions to explore. Rian Johnson has taken a calculated risk to freshen up the series and I am interested in seeing how all of this will be resolved in episode nine. ","true":true}
