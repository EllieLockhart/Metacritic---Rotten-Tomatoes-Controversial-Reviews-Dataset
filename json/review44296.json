Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many forced awkward characters and plot points. Too much quirky humor that doesn\u2019t work. Not enough of what makes Star Wars so cinematically engulfing. Disappointing Star Wars installment but still entertaining. ","true":true}
