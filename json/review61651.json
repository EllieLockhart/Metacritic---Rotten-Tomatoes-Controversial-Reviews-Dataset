However\\, it quickly becameRecently I have finally finished the game\\, and I am very conflicted. I wanted to love this game but unfortunately I don\u2019t. The gameplay is reminiscent of the first entry in the franchise. Although the character animations were greatly overhauled\\, the gameplay lacks innovation and feels almost outdated in 2020 nonetheless it was serviceable and fairly enjoyable. However\\, it quickly became tedious\\, the game lacks action set pieces like uncharted series which provide some variation. The world is absolutely stunning and looks cruel and unforgiving. This is definitely the best looking game on PlayStation. I particularly enjoyed the more open areas where I could explore the ruined buildings and gaze at the amazing details. The atmosphere is dark\\, charmless and inhospitable which greatly helps you to immerse yourself in this beautifully crafted world. The voice acting likewise is extremely good\\, the actors did a phenomenal job. However\\, the first game was not praised for its cutting edge graphics or revolutionary gameplay but for its immersive and truly groundbreaking storytelling. The Last of Us 2 story is an unmitigated disaster\\, the game fails to form a connection between the player and the new characters the way the original did. The plot is full of horror and outrageous scenes just for the sake of it and lacks narrative cohesion. What I disliked the most was the constant jumping between flashbacks and current time events\\, although the flashbacks were arguably the highlight of the game\\, it took away from the immersion\\, it would have been great if the game started off with the flashbacks and then played out as a continuous story. The characters undergo almost no development throughout the game and as the player we do not get involved in their individual stories and experiences. Most of the characters returning from the original game are almost unrecognisable. The game reminds of Game of Thrones season 8 and Star Wars: the last Jedi where \u2018subverting expectation\u2019 was more important than creating a compelling storyline. If you enjoyed the original game because of the gameplay\\, you will have an absolute blast with this game. However if you were looking for a continuation of one of the best video game stories ever\\, you are in for a huge disappointment.The game is NOT garbage nor a masterpiece. I enjoyed certain aspects of this game but the story was not one of them. I highly recommended waiting for a sale or buying a pre-owned copy. You can pick one fairly cheap off eBay. The place is flooded with this game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
