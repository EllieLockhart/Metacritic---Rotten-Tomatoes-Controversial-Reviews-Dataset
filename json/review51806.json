Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A failure\\, the first star wars film I do not like. So many things done wrong that don't align with the Star Wars. This movie was blatantly made for marketing merchandise and not for portraying the saga with its usual style. Humor was WAY out of place\\, it ruined the movie. The humor killed serious moments between main characters that needed content and explanation","true":true}
