Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is the biggest waist of time and potential I have ever seen. It is so badly written I can't even explain how much. Actually\\, I can I think Suicide Squad\\, that I deeply hated\\, had a better script thant the last Jedi. Obviously\\, the people responsible of writting this movie didn't know the other ones. They didn't know the caracters\\, they didn't know force\\, they didn't even know simple space laws! And what makes me even sadder\\, is that they just didn't seem to know how to write a story\\, which is suppose to be their f****** job! \\nIndeed\\, this entire movie seems useless\\, because for the most part it is. Most of the plot could have been eliminated if only the behavior of the caracters followed simple logic. There is so many plot hole\\, so many things that are introduced and never exploited\\, so many nonsence! And I am talking about this movie alone not even the force awaken. \\nIt could have been so good\\, but it's pure garbage. I wasted my money and I hope you won't.","true":true}
