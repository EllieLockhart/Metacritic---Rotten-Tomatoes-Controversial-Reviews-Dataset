Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Never would I have expected someone to make an experimental Star Wars film. It was a bold risk\\, but it definitely paid off. Not everyone will like it\\, but that's okay because this movie is what the Star Wars franchise needed. The Force Awakens played it safe and nostalgic to draw longtime fans back in with it's familiarity\\, while The Last Jedi totally sets it's own tone and makes the franchise new and exciting again. This is definitely my new favourite Star Wars film","true":true}
