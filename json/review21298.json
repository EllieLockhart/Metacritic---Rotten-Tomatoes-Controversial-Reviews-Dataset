Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went in wanting to see a movie about dark and light filled with my favorite characters\\, I left after seeing an obnoxious comedy with little to no plot what so ever. It seemed as if the director never saw a SW movie at all or just didn't care. In fact it seems as if he never saw a movie before at all. Also I would like to add that I am not a Troll\\, Disney\\, I just genuinely disliked this film. Believe me\\, I want to love it but the more I think about it the more confused and angry I get.","true":true}
