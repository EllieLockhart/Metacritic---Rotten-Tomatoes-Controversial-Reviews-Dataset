Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After butthurt leftist Colbert made that sketch equating Star Wars fans to right-wing nerds\\, the most stupidest people of the world AKA the american leftists (whose butt still hurts after Hillary's defeat)\\, have started this evidently coordinated effort to bring TLJ score up again.\\nYou poor things should consider 2 facts:\\n\\n1. A lot of Star Wars fans are not right wing supporters. Maybe the vast majority of them are not. Most of them hate Trump and did not vote for him.\\n2. You are defending a movie made by the most capitalist\\, white-enslaving\\, chauvinist\\, bigot company in America (Disney) and by a failed social justice warrior director and a feminazi producer.\\n\\nIf you fail to understand this 2 absolute truths\\, you will continue to fight for the people you actually hate most.\\nAnd this demonstrates how stupid you are.\\n\\nMoreover\\, this abrupt rise of 5-star reviews only demonstrates that it is YOU who manipulate the score\\, not any hypothetical alt-right group. You should be ashamed.","true":true}
