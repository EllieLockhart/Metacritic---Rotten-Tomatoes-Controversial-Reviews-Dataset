Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just like a 3 am drunken kebab that is dropped on the floor outside the shop\\, there was so much excitement and then so much disappointment. Rivals the prequel in cringe worthy moments. WTF is up with leia turning into some sort of space superman? Plot timing all wrong and the sub story with fin was dreadful and felt crammed in. So bad it inspired me to sign up to rotten tomatoes just to leave a review.","true":true}
