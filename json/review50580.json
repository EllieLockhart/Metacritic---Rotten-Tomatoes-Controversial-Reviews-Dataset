Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"2 stars is the best I can do here\\, and that's only because the Rey\/Kylo scenes were interesting. Everything else was such a rambling\\, tone-deaf\\, incoherent mess that I can't even start cataloging the problems. Rian Johnson is a hack and Kennedy is a corporate brand manager who has no understanding of storytelling fundamentals. The \\\"humor\\\" in this movie was terrible -- I heard more groans than laughs in the theatre around me. Nothing anyone outside of Rey and Kylo did made any sense or was of any consequence to the larger plot. For a movie this long\\, you expect story progression. What the hell was this movie ABOUT? Anyway\\, hated it. Very disrespectful movie. Held its core fanbase in contempt and didn't even try to hide it.","true":true}
