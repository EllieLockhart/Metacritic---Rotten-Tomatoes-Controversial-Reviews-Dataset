Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019m unclear how anyone who likes Star Wars would like this movie. It disrespects the characters we have known for decades and fails to even approach the quality of the previous Disney Star Wars movie. Misses the mark in every way. ","true":true}
