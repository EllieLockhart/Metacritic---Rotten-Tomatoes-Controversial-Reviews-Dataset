Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A second viewing of this film is definitely required to make sense of it\\, but I did enjoy it. There was so much going on and I think it is a little bit too long\\, but it is a great improvement on The Force Awakens\\, which I thought was poor. This film goes much deeper and the level of realism is incredibly high.","true":true}
