Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a fresh take on Star Wars that delivers unexpected twists and interesting\\, realistic character development. It takes the series in a new direction which it has seriously needed in order to progress\\, and I am very excited to see how the trilogy will end. The Last Jedi is by far the best Star Wars movie to date.","true":true}
