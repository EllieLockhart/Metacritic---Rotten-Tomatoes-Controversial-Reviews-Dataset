Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A big let down. More a parody than actual star wars. Story arcs of new characters were not as well thought out as antisipated. Key reveals\\, back stories and origins are left untold or not to the fullest. Too much bad humor or wrongly timed. The order and the resistence both prove themselves to be incompetent. Luke stands out but ultimately dissapoints. Nothing to look forward to in the third installment.","true":true}
