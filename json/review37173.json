Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only thing I was impressed by were most of the special effects.\\n\\nOtherwise:\\n\\n- Sloppy\\, sloppy\\, sloppy movie!!\\n- Made in a very lazy\\, lazy\\, lazy way!!!\\n- Excessive and countless plot holes\\n- Destroys all main characters from the original trilogy in an embarrassing way.\\n- Insulting to three generations of those fans\\, who really identified themselves with the great story told by SW.\\n- The new characters are not built properly. Now it is really hard to genuinely care about them.\\n- High content of politics regardind today's social justice\\, which IMO had no place in this particular movie.\\n\\nI left the theatre very dissspointed and angry at the same time. I was very sad too. Something inside me just broke in a nasty way.\\n\\nThere was no need to do this to a public who really loves this saga.","true":true}
