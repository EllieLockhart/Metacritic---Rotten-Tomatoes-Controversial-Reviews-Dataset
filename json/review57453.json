Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This Movie was nothing more than a pile of steaming shit.\\nSeriously\\, this is just garbage!\\nWhat was the story arc with this asian chick about? I would have liked to know more about Finn's character and how he could save the republic but no I had to go on with this chick I don't care about\\, onto a planet to do what?? euh... nobody knows\\, but hey... we've got to see some cool aliens and she saved the animals! yeah that's fun right? ....no! that's not right\\, that's plain  shit!\\n\\nThen there is the thing with Poe and the purple hair old sack\\, I don't remember her name because she's on screen for like 30 minutes and Boom \\, she goes suicide bombing on Snoke's ship. ( by the way\\, if that was that easy\\, why didn't they try it sooner with a smaller ship btw?)\\nThen Poe serves no purpose\\, why? cause he does stupid shit and is always worng whatever he does.\\n\\nOh\\, and yeah admiral Akbar is here too! but he dies like a bitch \\, while Leia gets to go full Iron man in space. That must be really cool to have skywalker blood\\, it gives you the power of Ex Machina.\\n\\nThen Snoke dies for no reason at all\\, we don't know who he was....  over.\\n\\nAh yes.. I almost forgot\\, Rey's parents are just alcoholics\\, who sold her to drink more...   ok so she's just the most powerful jedi in the galaxy without any background to it.... That's complete bullshit.\\n\\nAnd Luke dies like a shitty homeless dude\\, yeah because he's a homeless old guy who can't  fight...\\n\\nThis is the end of Star Wars... This film sgaa is supposed to be the Legacy of The skywalkers... what is left? a Mary Sue related to no one who can one shot everything... and yeah she's gonna win against Kylo Ren\\, do you have any doubt about it?\\n\\nStar Wars is dead today\\, I will pretend this saga never existed \\, And Luke will remain the great Jedi Master he was meant to be.\\n\\nF##ck you Ryan Johnson! and F##ck you Kathlyn kennedy for Ruining star wars!","true":true}
