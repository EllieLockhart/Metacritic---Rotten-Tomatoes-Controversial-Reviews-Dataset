Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a fan I feel so disappointed with this film\\, the original characters has been destroyed and the new ones don't have much development\\, so many wasted opportunities with the future of the saga.","true":true}
