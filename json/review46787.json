Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well.  Honest initial reaction straight from the cinema\\, first viewing...\\n\\n#TheLastJedi gets a lot right but plenty wrong too.  Some baffling decisions made story wise.  Some bits that were just plain bonkers.  It also has some absolutely magical moments but overall it doesn't work.\\n\\nA script more concerned about shocking the audience than serving the story and characters set up in TFA.  I'm disappointed because I'd convinced myself that @rianjohnson would absolutely nail it.  He didn't.","true":true}
