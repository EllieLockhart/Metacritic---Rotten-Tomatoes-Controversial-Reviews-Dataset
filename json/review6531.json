Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Divisive and risky\\, 'The Last Jedi' benefits from its great ensemble and well-crafted action. Some hiccups in the first few acts are overcome by a tremendously emotional finale.","true":true}
