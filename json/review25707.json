Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not as good as \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back\\,\u201d not as satisfying as \u201cRogue One\\,\u201d but a good Act 2. Beautifully shot. Some great action sequences. And after the initial shock of the story\u2019s events\\, you\u2019re left with a spark (albeit a small one) of hope for the next generation of Jedi. ","true":true}
