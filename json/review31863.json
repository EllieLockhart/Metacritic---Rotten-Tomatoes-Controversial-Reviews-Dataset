Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoiler Alert:\\nI can look past the jokes\\, Finn and roses subplot and the complete lack of rey's training. I can look past how they handled Luke's character. What's worse is that Luke is now dead and can't even redeem himself. \\n\\nI've been a star wars fan for 20 years and I can't believe Disney would do this to Luke..... Anyway the rest of the movie was fine. Yes Rey is a \\\"nobody\\\"\\, Snoke was not given a backstory but it was very entertaining and definitely had some of the coolest lightsaber and space battles I've ever seen.\\n\\nRIP LUKE","true":true}
