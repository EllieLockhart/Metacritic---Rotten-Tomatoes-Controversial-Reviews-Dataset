Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When I was a sophomore in high school\\, in 1977\\, I stood in a line that wrapped around the theater to get tickets and watch the original Star Wars movie. I've seen the subsequent Star Wars movies that have been released\\, including this one tonight. I had heard that the audience rating was low\\, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I don't know what movie those people saw\\, but I thought the newest addition to the Stars Wars Saga was awesome! I laughed\\, I cried\\, and at the end\\, I wanted more! I recommend you go see it\\, and judge for yourself!","true":true}
