{"101487":139684,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-24","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw this movie with my wife the first full day of open release.  I had been exceeding careful to avoid any of my favorite film critic's critiques\\, any fan theories\\, anything on the 3 Star Wars YouTube channels I follow\\, and even the trailers. As we walked closer to the thearter\\, full IMAX of course\\, I told her something that I decided to post on FB: \\\"George Lukas himself\\, THE creator of this Star Wars Universe\\, that Luke Skywalker was the most powerful Forse user of all time\\, with no upper limit to his power.  As long as they f-that up\\, I'm good.\\\"  Sigh...  if only it were so.  I should have know something was afoot when during a co-press conference\\, Kathleen Kennedy\\, while GGeorge was Speaker\\, unceremoniously cut him off and began a rant about strong female characters\\, expanding the Universe\\, etc.  she the proceeded to retcon EVERYTHING before Disney bought Lucasfilm\\, with exception of the Of The movies\\, even then offering alternate interpretations of what happened.  So we are seated\\, have our drinks and the movie begins.  As soon as it beggins I feel my stomach start to drop.  Not only Luke been depowered\\, but he became a towering scared woos.  Right there\\, the entire Star Wars Universe was disrespected.  I can clearly see why Mark Hamil had some choice words about his character.  Every aspect of the Casino\\, at absolute BEST\\, was filler\\, in a pathetic effort to eaither add running time or take our minds off the RIDICULOUSNESS of the space battle.  Leading over from \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" I can easily see stealing the idea of a Death Star\\, then supersizing it to blow up the the heart of the New Republic.  What I absolutely will not accept is the entire New Republics fleet\\, a fleet that sent the remnants of the Empire packing\\, was close enough to those planets to be taken out as well.\\n\\nAny Cadet who had completed their first year\\, from any of three U.S. Military Academies\\, would tell you that among the BIGGEST tactical mistakes a fleet commander can make is to have all his\/her forces bunched together\\, ala Pearl Harbor.  Yet after super woos Luke send Rey away\\, the Resistance Fleet is puny at best.  Logically\\, there should be hundreds\\, if not thousands of New Republic capitital ship scattered in small fleets\\, that should be both on the hunt for the First Order or sending ships to support the Resistance Fleet.  Which by the way was smaller than the fleets Of Alliance at Scarriff and Endor.  I can suspend disbelief with best of them\\, but as a scientist by training and also an unusual intellect\\, who has read many books on nuances of war\\, tactics\\, nearly every branch of science except Astrophysics and spy tech.\\n\\nIt seemed that First Order had its entire fleet was in pursuit of the incredibly small Resistance fleet.  \\n\\nSpeaking of the Resistance Fleet\\, they have\\, among the Most rag tag fleet in Star Wars history\\, are bombers. ALL of which are paper dragons.  A few hits from from Fist Order TIE fighters they fall to pieces.  Leaving out the fact that very few X-Wings\\, suddenly Stormtroopers are crack shots AND going against all previous Rebellion war Doctrine\\, the bombers had no shielding whatsoever.  A Tactical and Doctrinal cluster fuck.\\n\\nThen somehow\\, while distracted by squeezing intel out of Rey\\, Snoke does not not hear a lightsaber rattling around\\, before said lightsaber is ignighted by Kylo\\, cutting Snoke.  Then Kylo and Rey team up to take out the Pretorian guard.\\n\\nNow the hot pursuit where ships from the Resistance are running out of fuel and one shot.  Never before have Emperial forces been that good of shot.\\n\\nOff in the distance\\, Luke can't bring himself to light the Force Tree.  In pops Force Ghost Yoda\\, the Leprechaun Imp can control the weather and one hits the Tree with Lighting.  The dogma of Force Ghosts in every movie was they COULD NOT interfere or interact with living world except to speak to Jedi With whom they had prior attachments.  Yet here is Yoda laughing his ass of like a miniacle elf.\\n\\nAfter the best shooting in Stormtrooper history\\, one shot every troop carrier. Then go on to relight the Battle Of Hoth on a much less frozen planet.  Along with their upgraded AT's\\, wait for it\\, a giant super weapon.  Predictably the strangely small\\, underarmed\\, undermanned\\, under supplied Resistance blast door is smashed.\\n\\nBut wait\\, not only is Projection\\, much younger Luke there to stall\\, but for the first time ever in Star Wars Universe\\, Luke himself doesn't come to aid his friends and family.  Then poof\\, he is one with Force\\, just like the weakest of Jedi\\, without taking part AT ALL in helping\\, with wreckles abandon\\, his friends.\\n\\nSimply put\\, Rian John and Kathleen Kennedy are fast tracking removing every Lucas fingerprint and taking full control of Star Wars as they see fit. Systematically killing off every significant character in the Star Wars\\, so that only characters with their finger prints remain.\\n\\nAs a movie\\, had I never seen a Star Wars franchise\\, suspending disbelief would have ended within the first 10 minutes.  It is clear that Kathleen Kennedy and the Star Wars hack Rian Johnson\\, above all things\\, wanted the First Order to win and win big.  Both of these idiots should fed to the lion.","true":true}
