Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Meh\\, in typical Disney fashion they have taken what could have been a serious and threatening enemy and turned them into comic relief. \\\"ARRRRGGG DESTROY THEM ALL!!!!!!\\\" he yells spitting everywhere with a strain in his neck and forehead\\, face turning red with insane anger.\\n\\nThe first order is now a childhood villain\\, with no purpose other than arbitrary evil so that the kiddies know who not to root for.\\n\\nOh\\, and don't get me started on the rest of the plot twists. SPOILERS AHEAD\\, I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SAY THIS\\n\\nSnoke's death was terrible. Aside from it being a terrible plot decision\\, it was handled in the worst was possible. One second we're to believe that Snoke could challenge Luke 1v1 and the next he's being cheapshot by le emo boy. Not even a lightsaber duel\\n\\nBut none of this matter. Star Wars fans are no longer the market of the movies. It's the fully grown adult man laughing like a madman at a porg. It's the college aged girl who claps and screams and laughs so loud at every scene (because girls like star wars too)","true":true}
