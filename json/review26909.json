Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best movies of the franchise. The movie gave me chills\\, almost make me cry sometimes. The story is very good and the music is epic!! The Force is strong with that movie!","true":true}
