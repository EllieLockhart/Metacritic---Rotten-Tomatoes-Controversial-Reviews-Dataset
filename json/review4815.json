Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Complete trash\\, don't believe the reviews posted by brainwashed sheep critics. This film is objectively bad with serious plot holes that shouldn't be allowed just because this is a Star Wars movie. Save your self the price of admission and disappointment and skip episode 8.","true":true}
