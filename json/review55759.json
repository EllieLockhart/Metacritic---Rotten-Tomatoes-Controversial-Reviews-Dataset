Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall this is my review. \\nA very bold movie taking Star Wars in a new step that it's never gone before. Visually and from a sound design standpoint\\, it's a Star Wars Movie\\, meaning it's absolutely amazing. I especially enjoyed the parts on Snoke's ship and Crait. I really enjoyed a lot of the characters from the Force Awakens\\, including Rey and Poe. At the same time\\, there were some comedic moments that felt off in a moment where it was supposed to be serious (I'm holding for Hux). The part with Finn and Rose on Canto Bight felt like it took you out of the action. I wanted to see more of Snoke but his death was still an interesting moment. Kylo Ren and Luke were the best parts of the movie. They stole the scene whenever they were in the movie\\, and their interactions with Rey were fantastic. A very visually impressive movie that is overall good but flaws hold it back from perfection.","true":true}
