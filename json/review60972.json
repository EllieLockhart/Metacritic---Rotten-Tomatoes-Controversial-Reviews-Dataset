Hard pass from me and I couldn't recommend anyone but this insult. The fact that only IGN JP rated thus below a 9\/10 tells how many reviewers didn't care to actually review this dumpster fire. I hate to say they got paid to give it a stellar score but there's really no other justification other than keeping Sony happy.\r\rTl;Dr don't buy\\, let it die.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
