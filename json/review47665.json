Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When Billy-Dee Williams was cast as Lando\\, it wasn't to fill a quota. It was because he had the charm\\, charisma\\, looks\\, voice\\, screen-presence and talent to bring that character to life.\\n \\nBy contrast\\, this film (especially Rose and Purple Hair) are cast specifically with thnic\/gender quotas in mind. And they're terrible and annoying characters for that reason.\\n\\n\\\"That is why you fail\\, Johnson!\\\"","true":true}
