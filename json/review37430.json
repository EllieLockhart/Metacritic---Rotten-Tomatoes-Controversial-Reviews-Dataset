Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are a lot of things I could nit pick... from no Snoke back story to the Rose\/Finn casino dead end sideplot.  The one thing I can't forgive is the direction Luke's character went.  It seems like a completely different character.  The Jedi who brought Vader back to the light would not runaway. \\n\\n A few good things I'll mention are Rey\\, Kylo and the guards in Snoke's throne room....that was awesome and the light speed kamikaze scene.  \\n\\nOver all very disappointing.","true":true}
