Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":" A very mediocre and predictable addition to the Star Wars franchise. There were so many pointless stories in this movie that took away from the enjoyment of the true plot. Hoping that the end of this trilogy segment will make up for this!","true":true}
