{"101487":130578,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't like it that much. Leia is somehow using the force to fly through space like superman. Force ghosts can suddenly interfere with the material world. Snoke's death\\, Captain Phasma's death and Luke's death were major disappointments. Too much slapstick everywhere. Rey and Kylo are not related\\, but have a special connection through the force. Rey is a nobody and who was Snoke? What did he want? Both Kylo and Rey behave like little children through the whole movie. Luke is totally OOC. Yoda laughs a bit too hard and Luke \\\"milks\\\" (yes - milks) an ugly female alien. *lol* Oh\\, and Leia survives. I love her character\\, but that didn't feel right. Lots of eye-candy and nostalgia though and I love the Porks! I don't know - maybe 6\/10.","true":true}
