Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was terrific. Don't over think it. Great fun with the newer characters (Rey\\, Poe and Finn) and a fitting arc for Luke and Leia. While VII was essentially a remake of IV\\, VIII breaks new ground\\, and the franchise is better for it. ","true":true}
