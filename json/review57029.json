Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film took on the impossible task of fulfilling massive fan expectations\\, remaining true to a decades old franchise\\, carving a new and exciting direction for the story\\, and being generally appealing to a wide audience. I applaud Rian Johnson for choosing to make a film that meant something in addition to being entertaining. This film not only has great epic star wars battles and the quirky humor that has ALWAYS been a part of the franchise\\, but also comments on the arrogance of risk taking male commanders\\, the familiar and wretched economy behind the military industrial complex\\, and in reworking our understanding of the force\\, opens up the dream of saving the Galaxy to those whose name is not \\\"Skywalker.\\\"","true":true}
