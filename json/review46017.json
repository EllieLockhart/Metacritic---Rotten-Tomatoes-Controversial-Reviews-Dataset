Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually spectacular\\, spectacularly acted\\, almost everything else about it is a spectacular failure.\\nCharacters either experience no growth whatsoever or\\, in Luke's case\\, reverse the growth they experienced in previous installments. New characters are insipid. A real waste of a talented cast.\\nMajor and minor plot holes abound (free-falling contact bombs in space?)\\n\\nWorst moment: Leia flies like Peter Pan.\\n\\nThere are hairy duck puppies that are neither funny nor endearing unless you are under 5 years old\\, but thankfully they barely take up 15 seconds of screen time.\\n\\nI'd go on\\, but it's not worth it.","true":true}
