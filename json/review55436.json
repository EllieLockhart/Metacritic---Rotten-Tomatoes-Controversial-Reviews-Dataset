Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"May contain spoilers :\\nI thought this movie was the best in the franchise ! It was set out and accomplished what it meant to ! To kill the past !\\nIf they did not make this movie he way they did \\, it would have been the beginning of the end for Star Wars . Instead it has been revamped \\, renewed and has been the 'spark' to get the fire burning .\\nThere may be the 'Star Wars parents ' out there saying \\\"he's not my skywalker' . Basically acting like mothers who go my little boy can do no wrong clinging to what they wish there little boy was . However those people are wrong and flimflam to the past and something they think they own\\, but don't . All in all this movie shocked me and took me into a moment where my jaw literally dropped . It made me feel stupid because I could not predict what was going to happen! Absolutely loved this film!","true":true}
