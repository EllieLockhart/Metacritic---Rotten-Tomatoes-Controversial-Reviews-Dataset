Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Tells a story we haven't seen before. Hiccups with the B-plot and under-utilized lead characters aside; spectacular visuals\\, appropriate fan-service and additional world building fuel this chapter. There's little I would want different with the central themes and plot\\, which has me excited for the next episode!","true":true}
