Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I know many people disagree and that's fine. We need to accept that people won't always like what we like or enjoy what we enjoy. And that's actually a great thing in many ways because we get to see it from a different perspective! However\\, I cannot agree with people who say The Last Jedi wasn't good\\, because man\\, oh man\\, was it.  I was blown away and I adored every second of it.  I went in prepared to love Kylo Ren and the whole cast for being who they are and I wasn't disappointed at all. \\n\\nI heard some say that there wasn't a lot of character development\\, but I beg to differ. Rey sheds the personal of a naive young girl from Jakku who just wants her parents\\, to be a woman who realizes she is a Jedi and can help shape the world.  I don't want to go into too much detail\\, because spoilers\\, but here's hoping you give it a chance.","true":true}
