I cannot in good consciousness recommend this game in any way.\r\rDon't get me wrong it is pretty and somewhat well designed but for a AAA title\\, not so much. This is where the good kinda ends. The story is badly written and poorly executed in my opinion. And i'm not even talking about the current views and spoilers doing the rounds. Just the Established characters are off. Things are very filler oriented\\, character empathy is forced and strained.\r\rControls in the first game were almost the same but smoother. The upgrade paths are linear and very 'static' in TLOU2.\r\rIt is such a polarising game\\, some people wont care and 'fan boy\/girl' and say it's amazing\\, but seriously\\, the standard is slipping.\r\r2\/10 graphics do not a 10\/10 alone\\, game play and story matter too.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
