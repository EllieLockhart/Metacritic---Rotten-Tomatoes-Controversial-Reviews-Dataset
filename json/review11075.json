Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Heroism\\, spectacle\\, humor\\, and tragedy abound in the latest Star Wars movie.  Mark Hamill brings a new richness and subtlety to Luke Skywalker in a performance that eclipses the rest of the cast.  The nostalgia is kept in good balance with the fresh new elements\\, but the newer story arcs and characters occasionally seem like background noise to the continuing story of Skywalker.  Only occasionally\\,  though\\, and while I feel that eliminating said occasions would have made for a leaner movie (a bit of a slog at two-and-a-half hours)\\, the whole experience is still a truly great one\\, and I can truly say that it ranks among the very best of the series.","true":true}
