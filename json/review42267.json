Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie sucked. I will admit there were great moments with some old friends that I loved\\, however\\, overall I feel Disney is hell bent on ruining my childhood. Luke was mishandled and so much potential was left out. No real back stories on Snoke and poof he is gone.. don't waste your money. Wait for it to be on Netflix.","true":true}
