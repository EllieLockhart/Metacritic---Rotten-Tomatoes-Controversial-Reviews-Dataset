Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love the original 3\\, hated the 3 prequels and then loved The Force Awakens. This is probably the worst of them all\\, i dispise it and the director and writers. I will never watch another star wars film again.","true":true}
