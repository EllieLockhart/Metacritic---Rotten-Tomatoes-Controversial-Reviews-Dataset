Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall a very pretty film with great visuals and acting. However\\, it does not serve as a faithful sequel to The Force Awakens (TFA). It is as if JJ Abrams left all his toys in the sandbox and Johnson came in and wanted to play a different game. Where the TFA played it safe in being a spiritual nostalgia recreation of A New Hope\\, The Last Jedi (TLJ) tries too hard to be something new and different. Hopefully\\, Episode 9 will find the right amount of \\\"balance\\\" between the two styles. My biggest issue is that there is no pay off for all of the plot threads seeded in TFA. It is especially annoying since TLJ is a long film that does not spend all of its runtime focusing on the right characters or the plot threads that the audience cares about. In summary\\, it is not a bad film\\, but it also will not be the Star Wars movie that people will want to watch over and over again. To put it simply\\, there are literally no epic lightsaber fights in the entire film.","true":true}
