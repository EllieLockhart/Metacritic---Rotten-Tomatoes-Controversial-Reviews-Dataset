Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie fails totally.  The storyline is convoluted and lacks in creativity.  It lacks in creativity as the plot is simply that of The Empire Strikes Back with alternations in detail but not substance.  It is convoluted as there is no character developed to a degree as to cause the viewer to identify with them.  Rey's epiphany regarding the Force comes from nowhere.  Rather stupid jokes are employed far too liberally.  CGI is everywhere for no good reason.  The little slave children are totally unconvincing in their role and therefore do not have the emotional impact presumably intended.  The filmmakers completely squandered a great opportunity to create something interesting and new while building on the past.","true":true}
