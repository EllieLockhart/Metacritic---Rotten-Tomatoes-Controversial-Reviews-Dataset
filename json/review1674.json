Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As an action film\\, it's got some great visuals and sequences.  Unfortunately\\, this film is littered with ill-timed humor and cheap plot devices.  Character development is shallow and inconsistent. It's also interesting to note how this film received 94% from critics while fans in general are more divided.","true":true}
