Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie seem half-baked at best.  At several points during the movie you could see that they had provided themselves options for the plot line and made distinct choices.  Other pieces just seem completely out of place in the situation at hand.  Also\\, Laura Dern's character seems like a sub-in for someone else they couldn't sign (purple hair?  really?).  The misplaced jokes and unnecessary emotional scenes detract and distract rather than provide meaning like they did in the original series.  Overall\\, I expect better of Star Wars and Disney.","true":true}
