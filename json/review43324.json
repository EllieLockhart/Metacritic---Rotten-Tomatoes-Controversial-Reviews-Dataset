Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a great movie. It did what the forst two in this series failed to do - make it feel like a true star wars film. I feelike the 1st 2 couldve been told in one film\\, and this could've been told in two. But\\, all in all it is an excellent film.","true":true}
