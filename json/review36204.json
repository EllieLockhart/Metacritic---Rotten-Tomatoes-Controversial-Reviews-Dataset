Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was so awesome! Thoroughly entertaining and had a great message. Don't let the hardcore Star Wars fan nerds discourage you. They all jump on the same bandwagon. The movie had so much feels to it and moments that keep you in awe. Don't give in to the bad fan reviews!\\n\\nSPOILER SECTION->>>>Their disappointment could come from the destiny of some of their beloved characters. However\\, fanboys expectations are unrealistic and egocentric. Who says a female can't become the hero\\, or the old hero must be what they were hoping\\, or what rules apply to sci-fi fantasy. At the end of the day these movies are for our children and the messages and experiences they acquire. People are so disappointed about Rey's lineage. Why can't someone who came from poor upbringings rise and forge their own path and become a hero. You don't need to have a famous name to be the hero!<<<<","true":true}
