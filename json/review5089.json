Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Critic are mad. The Script is so bad it's beyond words. There are so many plot holes\\, and subplots without any payoffs. Snoke is a joke\\, old characters are ruined. On the plus side: acting is decent\\, music and effects and costumes are great.","true":true}
