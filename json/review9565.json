Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good fun with some nice character development\\, especially for Rey and Kylo Ren\\, who establish their position as central characters in the final trilogy. The porgs provide some comic relief without becoming annoying and the old geezers (Luke and Leia) blend great with the newcomers.","true":true}
