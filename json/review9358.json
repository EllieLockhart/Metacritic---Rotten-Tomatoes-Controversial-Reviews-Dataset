Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Gets a lot of hate this movie\\, but in my opinion\\, I think that this is the strongest of the franchise. It has a different take on the idea of the force and Jedi and holds itself without needing other movies. This is a great movie.","true":true}
