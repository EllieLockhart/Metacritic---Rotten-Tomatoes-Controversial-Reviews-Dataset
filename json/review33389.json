Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Takes all of the criticisms from the last movie and turns the franchise upside down. Utterly surprising\\, but magnificently imaginative. A fun story that that propels the story and characters forward in a way that gets everyone excited for episode 9.","true":true}
