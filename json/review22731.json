Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Listen up haters! This is an amazing movie because of the beautiful thread tying all the films together. Why can't you see it? If you're a true fan then go back and watch episodes I-XIII. It's right in front of you. It's beautiful and powerful. The theme that George Lucas never wavered from is right there on the big screen. Disney hasn't ruined Star Wars. George Lucas handed over the reins to the company that understands a good love story. Star Wars is a space fairy tale entwined with mythology. Episode IX will be epic!","true":true}
