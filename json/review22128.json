Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Killing off what made the franchise great while ironically killing off all the cast memebers that made the movies great; Kathleen Kennedy needs to stay in her lane and quit ruining on of the great pillars of sci-fi.\\n\\nThe injection of SJW cancer into sci-fi (which is overwhelmingly supported by MEN) is having a similar effect when Marvel tried to feminize its comic books- people stop buying them.\\n\\nYour franchise is turning to ash while you play you fritter away your remaining fans with virtue signals and purple haired douche-ex-machinas.","true":true}
