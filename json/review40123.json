Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"This is not going the way you think\\\" .. Well they got that right. I expected a good Star Wars flick and got just a very bad movie in general. Throwing away characters and storylines left and right with a sense of humor that is just dumb and not funny at all. Not worthy of the Star Wars name. ","true":true}
