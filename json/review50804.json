Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A big dump taken on Luke and the original trilogy.  At least the prequels didn't ruin Luke. Thanks Disney.  \\n\\nAlso\\, pathetic attempts at humor that undermined the emotional \\nintensity of immediately preceding scenes.","true":true}
