Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney's attempt\\, to milk the Star Wars Franchise to appease every demographic and viewpoint possible\\, falls flat and permanently stains a once promising franchise. This is not a Star Wars film and should have never been cleared for release.","true":true}
