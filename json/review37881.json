{"101487":178880,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The same questions you have going in\\, will be the same questions you have leaving. Where did the skywalker lightsaber come from? Who is snoke? How can rey (a NOBODY) handle a skywalker who are descendants of the force itself with literally no training? How can Leia fly? (yes fly. Fly like superman) and what force power is this? If Leia can fly in space where there is virtually no air and end up in nothing less than a coma with little force training\\, how can luke die from projecting himself when he is a master of the force? The middle of the movie drags. Action scenes are superb so I give this a 1 star. 1 star for making me more confused than when I went in.","true":true}
