Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Clearly they will sell a lot of porg dolls\\, but how about selling milk dispensers in the shape of sea cows with 4 teats? Riddled with plot holes\\, over reliance on humor\\, characters killed off with no backstory. I hated the Phantom Menace as much as anyone but at least that movie had character arcs and a logical plot progression.","true":true}
