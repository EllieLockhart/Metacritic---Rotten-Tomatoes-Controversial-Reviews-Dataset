Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute garbage. One of the worst script I've ever seen in sci-fi films. It's full of plotholes\\, inconsistencies and idiotic characters. Not to mention violating even the simplest laws of physics like neglecting weightless in space or surviving in space without a spacesuit. \\n\\nI feel really sorry for Hamill that he had to play that character\\, what they've done with Luke Skywalker is outrageous. With age comes wisdom? That's not about him in this movie\\, in Episode VIII with age comes obtusity\\, cowardice and lunacy. Yes that's how Luke Skywalker was depicted there as obtuce timid lunatic who looks like he needs immidiate medical treatment.\\n\\nIf you are interested who's Snoke\\, why Rey has force abilities\\, why Ren suddenly turned into dark side\\, you will find no answers\\, moreover Snoke seems to be removed from the storyline being killed like an idiot in the middle of the film\\, this is probably one of the ''surprise twists'' creators were talking about. \\n\\nThere are no positive sides in the film except for decent play of Hamill and del Toro. Many people say about stunning visuals\\, but come on\\, who you can surprise with visuals in 2017? Modern technologies allow to make pretty good visuals even in mediocre sci-fi\\, let alone such expensive works like Star Wars\\, so this is no longer a feature you can brag about.","true":true}
