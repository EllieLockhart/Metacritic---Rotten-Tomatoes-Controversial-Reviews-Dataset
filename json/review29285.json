Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rey's parents - nothing\\, Snoke - nothing\\, Luke - Nothing\\, BB8 vs evil 9 - nothing\\,  \\nThis movie was somewhat entertaining but the story is completely ruined and there is nothing left. I can't imagine what 9 can be about but I am not excited at all. Sad","true":true}
