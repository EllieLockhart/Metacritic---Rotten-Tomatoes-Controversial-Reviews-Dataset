Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie lacks consistency. Many scenes didn't need to exist. Very corny and cringe worthy in a few parts. Many of the jokes do not land and really seem uncalled for (star wars isn't a comedy\\, but they tried to make it one). So many things wrong with with this movie to mention. Great visuals... so they have that.","true":true}
