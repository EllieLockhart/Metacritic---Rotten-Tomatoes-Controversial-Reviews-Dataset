Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"92% from critics??!!! I\u0092m a huge fan of Star Wars and in general I love good cinema. This was quite simply just a bad movie. Geez\\, where to begin. \\n\\nThe Story: Painfully bad. 3 hrs I\u0092ll never get back. The plot made no sense and took Little to no effort on the part of the writers. The characters were put into situations you simply don\u0092t care about and you knew they would escape from. Just wanted plain bad. \\n\\nThe music: what the hell? It\u0092s loud\\, basic orchestra music that reminds you of a bad Indiana Jones flick and no original Star Wars score. It was so loud and annoying that it kept taking me out of the few decent scenes there were. Totally distracting.\\n\\nI don\u0092t know what they were thinking when they made this movie and I really don\u0092t know what the critics were thinking when they gave it positive reviews. I know there is some major conspiracy theory around why the user reviews are so low but having just left the theater this is the first time I\u0092ve been moved enough to actually write a review. It\u0092s simply that bad.","true":true}
