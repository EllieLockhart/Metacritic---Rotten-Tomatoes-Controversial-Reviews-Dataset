Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't get me wrong\\, this movie brought some fantastic concepts with it and visuals with it.  But unfortunately the story was rather lack luster and there was an entire sequence that felt completely unnecessary.  Also the forced romance and the kiss with the explosion in the background was very cheesy.  This movie took some bold risks and there were some very impact moments\\, but most to me personally were ruined to comedic lines or things that didn't make much sense at all ex. Leia floating in space and living. I feel the comedy that was used in this film was rather unnecessary. But I will admit it was funny\\, just out of place for me","true":true}
