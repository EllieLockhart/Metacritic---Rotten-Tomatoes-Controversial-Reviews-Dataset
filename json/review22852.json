Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Long time fan have read the books and comics\\, seen the TV shows\\, all the movies. The story was good not the way I expected it to go or exactly where I wanted it to go. However\\, I still liked the story and plot a lot. My problem is with the over the top comedic relief\\, it is comparable to jar jar. Why do we need all the comedy added it dumbs down and cheapens the movie. Some comedic relief is always acceptable but this was just to much. I had the same opinion of Guardians two and Thor ragnarok. I will go see it again but right now it's a 5\/10 for me comparable to the prequels.","true":true}
