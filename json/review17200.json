Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really like this movie... It have a lot of hidden meaning.. TLJ enriches TFA.. and makes it even better... understandably because they are part of a trilogy.. I can't wait to see how the story will unfold in ep 9 to round up this chapter.... \\n-------\\nI'm posting here to make an account to say that I can understand that some may not like this movie because it's not something that they like... it's normal... everyone have different taste...\\nBut what I don't understand is someone doesn't like the movie because the movie is different from their THEORY that they've been building for 2 years and then trolling everyone in the social media by TELLING AND BULLYING everyone about it... \\nWhy can't you just accept a good story and enjoy it? And if you don't enjoy just step away.. and let it go.... LET THE PAST GO!","true":true}
