Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too much slapstick comedy\\, too many plot holes\\, too many throw away moments all for the sake of misdirection\\, and somehow Rey and BB8 are the most powerful things in the galaxy without any explanation or realism.\\n\\nSomething went very wrong here. I don't know how a lot of this stuff got passed the drawing board. They did some thing well\\, but overall it was too ridiculous to be a good movie.","true":true}
