Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The plot was a mess and simply not interesting. The movie was at least 30 minutes too long and I wanted it to be over long before it was.  Corny\\, misplaced and unfunny jokes throughout.  Lastly\\, but most importantly\\, the beloved character of Luke Skyealker was needlessly  and ruthlessly assassinated.  The literal \\\"new hope\\\" of the galaxy who believed he could (and ultimately did) find the good in even the most evil person in the galaxy (Vader) is now a grumpy hermit who attempts to murder children in their sleep. Unacceptable.","true":true}
