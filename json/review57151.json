Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not the movie you were looking for.  Star wars is not only now dead\\, it is also buried.  As a movie\\, admittedly it is watchable\\, if you can get passed the hilarious implausible moments and the fact that the plot is neither interesting or well- it actually barely exits in the form of watching two ships chase each other  for about the length of most of the film.  I am a huge fan of the originals and for all their faults enjoyed the story of the prequels and appreciated that they weren't a rehash- which we get yet again with this one to some degree.  As a star wars film\\, well lets say I doubt if i will be going to the cinema to see any more. I mean\\, when did our princess learn to become all powerful in the force\\, you might as well put her up against Kylo Ren instead.  Every possible plot line that could have been interesting was thrown out and replaced with- nothing. The adventures with Finn and Rose are pointless and ultimately amount to nothing\\, if you think leaving the mother ship that is being fired upon\\, having an adventure and then returning to find the mother ship not destroyed by the still pursuing First order actually believable.. Ray is pulled by the dark side like Luke on Degoba  and just sees multiple reflections of herself- dull and boring.   As a sci-fi film what's with the gravity in space which is needed to bomb a spaceship- really?   The film also has a feminist agenda where all the main heroes and leaders are women and the men are stupid\\, need putting in their place\\, rescuing by a female or end up dead- way to go.   so much for equality.   The originals were a fairy-tale come opera in space\\, now it is just a farce in space.  And no i am not a troll.   Disney is only concerned about the \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\\, not making a good  movie\\, even in spite of Rogue one which i enjoyed.  The best bit of the movie was the sound track.","true":true}
