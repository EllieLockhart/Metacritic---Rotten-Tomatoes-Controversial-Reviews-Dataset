Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappoint in this film\\, here why:\\n1. Luke is totally unrecognizable in this film. We are suppos to believe that man who face down Darth Vader with nothing more than faith\\, loses that faith when facing his teenage nephew ??\\n2. Finn's whole storyline sucks\\, what was the was the point. Rose and him didn't do anything to save the fleet. Then in a bout of courage he defeats the super stormtrooper.\\n3. AR2 and C3PO\\, where are they? if someone were to watch this film without any knowledge of the Star Wars storyline  they wouldn't think these guys were important at all.  They are almost  nonexistent  in the film. They use to have their own storylines in films past. \\n\\nOverall\\, the film is a big let down!!","true":true}
