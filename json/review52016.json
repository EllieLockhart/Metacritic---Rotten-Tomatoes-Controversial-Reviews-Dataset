Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After chewing on this film and not having any desire to revisit after my original viewing in theater I am changing my review to a complete rotten bomb. The whole storyline of this film is a mess. They got Luke Skywalker's character all wrong (which Mark Hamill even said so before he was forced to recant). I would blame Rian Johnson completely for this and whoever gave him complete control of the story. There are no real enjoyable elements to this film and writer (Johnson) seems to disregard everything that was shown in previous films. Abrams who directed the previous entry and the follow-up to this understood the need to collaboration. I am never revisiting this film.","true":true}
