Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ Went beyond my expectations in terms of character development\\, drawing parallels with the prequels and the sequels\\, as well as introducing a new concept to the cinematic universe that was in the EU novels. It was a delight to see the dynamic between Rey and Kylo and how they affect each other. Another point that I somehow overlooked at first\\, however upon reflection it came to me\\, was how the film addressed the importance of thinking things through\\, that the heroic plan you have might not be the best and that the cost might be too high to really justify its execution. I really look forward to episode 9 and will be watching episode 8 at least two more time on IMAX.","true":true}
