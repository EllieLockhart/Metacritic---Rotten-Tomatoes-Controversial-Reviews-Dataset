Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall this movie was not good in my opinion.\\nEffects - 3\/5\\nOther than some good performances\\, and some good cinematography the only really good thing about this film was the excellent visuals by the CG team. Very well done guys.\\nPerformances -  1.5\/5\\nI thought most of the leads did a pretty good job with what they were given. Daisy (Rey). Mark (Luke)\\, John (Finn)\\, Oscar (Poe)\\, Adam (Kylo)\\, and Carrie (Leia) all performed quite well\\, in my opinion. I didn't think Kelly's (Rose) performance was stellar. Regardless of Kelly's performance\\, I don't think the few horrible people's vitriol was appropriate.\\nCinematography - 2\/5\\nFor the most part I thought the cinematography was good.\\nScript - 0\/5\\nA 0\/5 is really harsh\\, but I thought about this for a long time. If ever I had to give a script a 0\/5\\, TLJ is the one to get it. This script was a mess. I want to keep the review short\\, so I'll direct the reader to RedLetterMedia's \\\"Star Wars: The Last Plinkett Review\\\" as I agree with a lot of what was said there.\\nPR - 0.5\/5 \\nThis \\\"PR\\\" category is my review of how a studio or production responds to criticism\\, or praise. Ideally a film doesn't need to respond. If it does need to responds\\, that response\\, is fair\\, and honest.\\nDisney\\, was unfortunately\\, very bad with the way they handled the criticism\\, of this film. Instead of listening to the criticism\\, and considering it's validity\\, they immediately framed the criticism as \\\"hate\\\" from the \\\"internet trolls\\\". by selecting a few horrible reviews\\, and propping them up as being the opinion of ALL those that disliked it.\\n\\nOverall I've decided to give this film a 0.5\/5\\, as my enjoyment of the film was heavily impacted by the terrible direction and story. I certainly appreciated the brilliant effects and the decent performances\\, but unfortunately so much of this film relied on the script.","true":true}
