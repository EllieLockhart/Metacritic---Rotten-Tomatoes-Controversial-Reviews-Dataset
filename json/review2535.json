Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A weak movie\\, with the combined trash of Han Solo movie has forever ruined the Star Wars brand for me and I am done with it. Thanks for killing a beloved franchise. Can't wait to see what you guys kill next. This movie was boring\\, turtle paced\\, too many fake endings\\, terrible story telling\\, and just a retelling of Star Wars 5.","true":true}
