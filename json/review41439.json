Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a return to form for the franchise. Star Wars is sci-fi\/fantasy and like all great art of that genre it delivers a powerful theme and pushes against conventions. The original films did that very well. As much as I liked The Force Awakens\\, it didn't make me think or challenge my expectations. The Last Jedi does the exact opposite - and it's very refreshing. The movie uses the sci-fi\/fantasy lens to tell a great story about the grey moral universe we live in and to celebrate the democratic nature of true heroism. All this is done while developing three-dimensional characters and delivering some truly great action and stunning plot twists. We need more great sci-fi\/fantasy like this that pushes us away from the easy hero worship and simple good versus evil plots of recent sci-fi and fantasy movies.","true":true}
