Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic movie. I\u2019ll admit it starts out a little disjointed and I thought I was going to be disappointed but after the first 45 minutes to an hour or so the movie is phenomenal. Yes\\, the scenes with Finn and Rose aren\u2019t too interesting and some characters are not explained as well as they should\u2019ve been and I know fans will be disappointed. However it is a great movie that will be a great experience for most people.","true":true}
