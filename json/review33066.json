Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Stupid movie. It played out more like a 70's Saturday morning cartoon then a Star Wars movie. There was no philosophy of the force\\, there was no characters to like dumbest chase scene in movie history. The Ewoks were resorected\\, it tried too hard to be silly and campy. There was no respect given to the force or the characters. It was just so bad","true":true}
