I wanted to play through the whole game before leaving an impression here. If there were .5 options then I'd call this an 8.5 but opted to give an 8 instead.My main critiques are around the length of the game\\, some of the stealth mechanics\\, and how the game presents all the extra goodies while also pushing you to move forward (which create a strange discord).I put in about 28-29 hours to complete the game and didn't find every extra goodie available. While bigger is sometimes better\\, in this case some sections felt too long. I wanted to find out the next story beat and getting there never feels like a straight shot\\, or some unexpected wall pops up that adds 30 minutes to the section (a classic Naughty Dog trope at this point). TLoU II isn't the first Naughty Dog game that is guilty of this. Uncharted 2 and 3 had some sections that could have been shorter as well.As for stealth mechanics\\, maybe I'm really bad at playing stealthy in this game. I felt like I was being pretty careful to not be seen or heard but most of the non-infected enemies seem to be able to spot and hear me pretty easily. There are many sections of the game that were designed with hiding places (under trucks or beds\\, in storage containers\\, in tall grass) so it seems like there was an intention to be able to play in such a way to be unnoticed and sneak up on enemies but that rarely ever worked for me. I was in open combat more often than not.The last criticism I had is that when I spent time searching the larger areas looking for hidden extra goodies the game would prompt me to click L3 if I need a hint. I don't need a hint\\, I'm just trying to find the hidden things. For all the extra work Naughty Dog put into making extra notes\\, cards\\, coins\\, etc. the game equally pushes me to stop looking for those and move forward.As for the violence\\, it is a bit over the top but it wasn't off putting for me as a player. I would say if someone else was watching me play they'd probably think I'm a sadist but I swear I'm not :DEverything else about the game I enjoyed. The combat is tight (even when I didn't want to rush into combat)\\, the technical aspects of visual and audio presentation are fantastic\\, and I thought the story was good (albeit a bit too long). There are some flashbacks within flashbacks which does feel a bit strange but that feeds into my \\\"game is too long\\\" perspective. Could they have done it any other way? Probably\\, but I'm not a narrative or game designer so they did it better than I could.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
