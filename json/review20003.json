Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was great\\,  if it was fan fiction for 1970s Battlestar Galactica but being that this was supposed to be Star Wars  it was a horrid abomination.  I saw the first Star Wars when I was 5 in 1977 it been a big part of my life this movie disgusts me.","true":true}
