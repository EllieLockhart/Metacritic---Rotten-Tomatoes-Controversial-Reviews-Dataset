Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi was filled with twists and turns resulting a fun and exhilarating movie for all. Though there were some flaws including a couple plot holes and a side story that dragged\\, the movie still was great and kept me enjoyed and excited for the finale to this new trilogy in the legendary Star Wars saga.","true":true}
