Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"3.5\/5. Tone issues and pacing issues for sure\\, forced love interests and a little too much slapstick but a solid\\, dramatic and action packed plot that kept me on my seat and asking more questions\\, making me excited and intrigued for the next installment. (SPOILER TALK) The side plot with Finn was a little unnecessary. In the end\\, what they did didn't really matter\\, the rebels were retreating anyway. I felt it was all just so they could force a connection between that one girl and him. Poor forced love interests make me sad. What's with all the slapstick? I mean it was humorous at times (although very scarce) but I feel like it couldn't decide between being more dramatic or comedic. I also felt the use of Luke was good. He had some really good arcs.","true":true}
