Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a complete travesty.  All the individuals from the original trilogy are completely out of character and act nothing like they did in the originals.  Their legacies get completely trashed.  The movie tried so hard to be artsy and deep\\, but did it so blatantly obviously that all it wound up being was deeply annoying.  The plot is a complete mess with random tangents all over the place that don't serve to progress the movie or characters at all.  It was disheartening to see how some of my favorite characters were portrayed in this film\\, and the sad thing is that this can now not be undone.  I don't know how this screenplay got the green light from Disney\\, but this movie has effectively ruined Star Wars for me and a lot of other people I know.  I will likely never watch another Disney Star Wars movie after this one because I frankly don't care anymore. I wish I could give this movie negative stars\\, but 1\/2 a star will have to do.","true":true}
