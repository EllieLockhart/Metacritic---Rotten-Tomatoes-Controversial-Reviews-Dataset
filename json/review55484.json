Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie was good. Many unexpected things happened. Some so-called hardcore fans didn't like the movie\\, because they're theories about it we're wrong. It didn't go in the direction they thought it should\\, so that equaled bad reviews. I too was wrong about what was gonna happen. However if you're going to review based on failed theories\\, then don't review it. Take the movie for what it was. It had good acting\\, good visuals and the story was a good continuation of this 3rd saga. I'm sure opinions of this movie will change for some\\, when Episode IX comes out. They'll go back to episode VIII and be like \\\"Oh\\, that's the reason that happened.\\\"","true":true}
