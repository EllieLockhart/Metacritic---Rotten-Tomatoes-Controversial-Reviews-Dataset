Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As of date\\, to me\\, this is the most interesting movie in the franchise. While the movie abandons the plot lines the Force Awakens lay before us\\, it also gives us something new and different that we havent seen in this franchise so far. This is a Star Wars like no other you've seen\\, and I recommend it highly if you're a fan of Star Wars and have wished for something new.","true":true}
