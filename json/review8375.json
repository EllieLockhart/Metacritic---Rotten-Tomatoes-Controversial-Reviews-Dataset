Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Felt like the film wasn't written by someone who knew what they were doing; it tears down pretty much all of the work that the previous film builds\\, and leaves very little to follow. It's less science and more fiction with weird boat physics being one of the many cruical plot devices. There are some really good scenes but they are very short lived\\, and for some reason in the middle of the film rather than logically at the end. The story around those scenes is very staggered\\, mostly unrelated\\, and I think it was trying to be funny but was disappointing to watch the out of character mockery (there is actually a your-mom joke.) It felt like characters were going to learn some lessons but only two of the characters actually showed any development\\, and others had even regressed after their development in the previous film.","true":true}
