Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Life-long fan disenchanted by the Magical Kingdom. This movie was dreadful. The jokes were awful and just painful to sit through. Luke Skywalker 'legacy' completely ruined... I do not believe he would have gone after Ben Solo in his sleep like that. Stupid. Disregarded any kind of an interesting history or story (at all) with Snoke. 'The Force' is not intriguing anymore. Worst of all\\, there is absolutely NO over-arching story line that is interesting to me what-so-ever. Making everything up as they go\\, and not well. The movie was pretty at times\\, and I like the R2D2 hologram of Leah scene. That's it.","true":true}
