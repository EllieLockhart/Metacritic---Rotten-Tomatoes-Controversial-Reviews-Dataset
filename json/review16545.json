{"101487":137189,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In a nutshell:\\nThis movie was a giant middle finger by Rian Johnson and Disney to George Lucas. This movie is forces us to \\\"move on\\\" from the original trilogy\\, but doesn't give us any reason why we should do that.\\n\\nFull review *SPOILERS*:\\nThere are so many bad aspects on this movie I need to write them down one by one.\\n1. Characters\\nRian Johnson completely butchered all of the characterization of the main characters from the original trilogy. It's as if these characters are completely different people. Han Solo\\, who used to be a badass smuggler\\, became a meh character on the last movie. And they even killed him disgracefully. Remember that Han always shoot first? If that's bad this is even worse. They make Luke as someone who is willing to murder someone else in cold blood because he \\\"senses\\\" that said person has great darkness within. What happened to the whole thing about Luke not willing to give up on his father? Not to mention that LUKE IS AFRAID OF REY'S POWERS. THE FRIGGIN JEDI MASTER\\, SON OF ANAKIN HIMSELF! And oh\\, he died at the end just because he has to. Seriously. There's no logical reason as to why he died. He just sits there\\, and then he died. C'mon\\, he's not even that old. And if you guys don't buy what I just said\\, ask Mark Hamill himself. Or rather\\, read his interview\\, and his reaction about the characterization of Luke in this movie. Also\\, Leia is completely undignified in this movie. Like\\, Poe was able to disregard all of her orders\\, without any consequences whatsoever. Lastly\\, Yoda seems to lose all his wisdom\\, because the actions he did as a ghost is completely nonsensical whatsoever.\\nNow to the new characters. Rey's backstory is thrown out of a window\\, because it turns out her parents were junk dealers in Jakku. This just shows out how incompetent the writing team is. Not only that\\, she seems to know every single thing about everything. She learns how to wield a lightsaber by herself. She can lift rocks without any difficulties (contrary to what happened with Luke when he tried to lift an X-Wing). She even lectures Luke at one point in the movie. Then there's Kylo Ren. Who's still an emo\\, cheap and spoiled version of Darth Vader. Ridiculous. Also there's Poe\\, whose character is the total opposite of what he was portrayed with in The Force Awakens. Now it seems like he's some spoiled brat who thinks using his fist. Finn (and his new partner\\, forgot her name though) was quite interesting\\, and I'd say Finn's characterization here is better than on the last movie. Other than that\\, the side characters aren't worth mentioning (including Snoke) because they didn't leave a lasting impact.\\n2. Story\\nHere's where it gets really bad. The whole theme of the story was to make us \\\"let go\\\" of the past. In this case\\, Rian Johnson was trying to say that us (audience) need to let go of the original trilogy and accept the new one. But how they do it is disgusting. They killed off the characters from the original trilogy to make way for the new ones. That's just bad storytelling. It proves that THE CHARACTERS THEY CREATED FOR THE NEW TRILOGY WILL FOREVER BE OVERSHADOWED BY THOSE FROM THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY. They themselves admitted that\\, and yet\\, they want us to move on from the original trilogy. Their selfishness and hypocrisy knows no bounds it would seem.\\nNot only that\\, there were so many plot holes in this movie. One of the most noticeable is the whole \\\"hostage situation\\\" going on between the First Order and the Resistance armada. The First Order could just lightspeed one of their cruisers to be in front of the Resistance armada. Then the Resistance are trapped from both sides. Another possible solution is that if any ship in lightspeed can destroy other ships\\, then why don't the Resistance just use one of their support frigates to do that from the start? Other holes were the misinterpretation of the force and it's powers\\, the definition of a \\\"force ghost\\\"\\, etc etc.\\nAnother thing about this movie is how full this is of SJW bullshit. All the male characters in this movie are shown as impulsive\\, unwise\\, rebellious\\, etc. Want to disagree? Just look at said Luke's characterization. He tries to kill Kylo Ren \\\"in a moment of pure instinct\\\" which is bullshit\\, since Luke would never do something like that no matter what happens. Need another example? Poe's characterization as a cocky\\, trigger-happy\\, rebellious pilot. And also because of the SJW theme\\, all the female characters are wiser and better in every way. For example\\, all of the Resistance commanders are female\\, even all the bridge officers on-board the capital ship. Also\\, Rey who lectures Luke that he didn't fail Kylo Ren\\, but rather\\, Kylo Ren failed him (which is bullshit to begin with). There's also Rose who ended up sacrificing herself for Finn. Also\\, none of the female characters were \\\"killed\\\". All of them \\\"died\\\" (Phasma fell\\, not because Finn struck her. The purple-haired admiral rams her ship to Snoke's\\, Rose by sacrificing herself to save Finn)\\, while the male characters got killed (Snoke by Kylo Ren\\, Admiral Ackbar when the bridge blew off\\, etc). Also the whole scene on the gambling planet was just trying to promote that animals are more valuable than human lives and that capitalism is bad.\\nFinally\\, everything about Star Wars is gone in this film. The adventure\\, the whole thing about Light vs. Dark\\, the beautifulness of the universe\\, the diversity and uniqueness of each species in the movie\\, all gone. Also\\, there's no lightsaber duel in this movie. Which is a new low for Star Wars movies.\\n3. Cinematography\\nThe cinematography on this movie is just like any typical blockbuster on the recent years\\, Rogue One did better on this one.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nI watched this movie\\, and got my heart shattered because of it. It completely threw the Original Trilogy into the garbage bin\\, while also disregarding everything that made Star Wars feel \\\"Star Wars\\\". It turned Star Wars into a politically correct franchise with generic sci-fi story and generic sci-fi characters and also a generic sci-fi universe. It was bad\\, and Disney should retcon this and Episode VII just like what they did with the Extended Universe.\\n\\nDisclaimer:\\nThis is not a bot. This is from a real person and Star Wars fan\\, from someone who grew up with the Original Trilogy\\, along with many other negative reviews. The mainstream media lied once again\\, and their focus should be on the good reviews\\, because those are most likely people paid by Disney.","true":true}
