Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is an excellent\\, albeit flawed\\, Star Wars film. My criticism of the movie largely relates to a bit confusion in the tone and campiness in the dialogue\\, most egregiously with Rose and Finn and the casino subplot. However setting those issues aside I LOVED it. Star Wars has always been a bit cheesy and is supposed to be fun. The plot draws on both Empire and Return of the Jedi without being derivative in the way The Force Awakens was. Rian Johnson plays subtle homage to the originals in the way he shoots certain scenes and incorporates a level of style not seen in a Star Wars before\\, including a sequence which will dazzle you\\, silence you and take your breathe away all at once. The plot is the darkest of the Star Wars films\\, with the Resistance\u2019s back against the ropes and our heroes facing adversity and failure at each turn. The internal politics of the Resistance\\, between Oscar Issac\u2019s Poe Dameron and the always excellent Laura Dern as Resistance leader Holdo\\, showcases one of my favorite aspects of the plot. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver display an excellent chemistry in their scenes together which pays off in an unexpected but epic fashion. Both returning original cast members Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill are compelling performers in each and every one of their scenes\\, especially Hamill who turned in the best performance of his life as a disillusioned Luke Skywalker. I recognize the movie has flaws. However once I let go of the unfair expectation of perfection\\, and let myself enjoy the film\\, I loved it. The magic of Star Wars is still here and I\u2019m so excited for where this series will take us next.","true":true}
