Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was extremely disappointed with this movie. The main issue that needs to be addressed is that almost nothing makes any sense at all. Rey seamlessly is good at everything she does with little to no experience. Her background is discovered to not be anything special so she is just good at everything for no reason. Then there are major plot holes such as who in the heck is Snoke? Oh well guess he's gone now. Some things feel as though its straight from an anime especially Luke's lines when he faced Kylo in this movie\\, it was just embarrassing. Don't even get me started on Leia like wow who approved that scene? I just felt bad for Finn during this movie\\, all his parts were boring and I just wanted every scene of his to just be over. I just don't understand how they could mess up star wars like this. Is it that difficult to make a coherent plot? Personally I wasn't a big fan of TFA but at least that movie was somewhat enjoyable compared to this mess. Disney has ruined Star Wars.","true":true}
