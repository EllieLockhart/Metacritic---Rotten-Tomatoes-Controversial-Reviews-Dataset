Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful incoherent drivel that even a Star Wars fanatic should hate. Makes the prequels look good by comparison. You'll be pining for the days of Jar Jar by the time you get through (if you get through it).","true":true}
