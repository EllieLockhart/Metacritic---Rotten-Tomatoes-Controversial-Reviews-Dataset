Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was by far the worst Star Wars film I have ever seen. It felt like watching a first draft of a script that was not fully developed. The movie provided no emotional connection to the plot or the characters. The villains didn't even feel evil enough and the hype far outweighed the substance. It felt like the slate was wiped clean from the emotional investments that JJ Abrams cultivated in The Force Awakens. Abrams' film did such a great job at clearly defining who these characters were and watching The Last Jedi\\, it almost felt like these were stand alone characters that didn't quite build on what was established previously. It truly felt like watching a rough draft where the connections weren't fully formed and that the story was just rushed through for the sake of moving the story along. Maybe they were trying to stay true to Lucas' \\\"Faster\\, more intense\\\" approach from A New Hope\\, only they forgot the \\\"more intense\\\" part and focused on just being fast. Anyway\\, I could keep going\\, but you should get the point by now. I'm a long time fan\\, have seen all the films\\, read dozens of the books and will go see future Star Wars films but I'll be more hesitant and pessimistic than ever before in seeing a galaxy far far away. Shame on you Disney. Please redeem yourself and the franchise with the next film.","true":true}
