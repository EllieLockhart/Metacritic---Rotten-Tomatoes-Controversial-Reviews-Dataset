Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie for precisely the reasons that the haters hated it. A complex compelling story which brought the franchise bang up to date in terms of diversity\\, story and the shades of grey in real life. No\\, Luke isn't the same as he was in the original trilogy and was all the better for it. The Whole franchise has looked at complex narratives like GOT and brought us an epic space opera with heart\\, soul and brains.\\n\\nTLJ isn't perfect. I agree that we don't find out enough about Snoke or Phasma\\, but in a movie stuffed to the hilt with great moments I understand there just wasn't room. Rey and Kylo are the main protagonists and it was right to focus on them.\\n\\nI've yet to meet anyone who hasn't loved this movie\\, so I'\\, not sure which planet the haters are living on. Possibly the planet COD from the language used.\\n\\nI'll be more than happy if the trolls keep away from future installments\\, but they'll still go so they can spout their hatred and feel important about themselves.","true":true}
