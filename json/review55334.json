Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lmao.. I think peeps are being way too harsh but hey we have our own opinions.. Spoilers below: I like that they broke the Skywalker lineage and that Rey is normal.. it negates the whole chosen one theme.. it also showed that Rey\u2019s connection to Kylo isn\u2019t blood but via the force.. she\u2019s his light side equal.. I also figured Leia knew that was a force projection of Luke and wasn\u2019t really him which is why she responded the way she did.. he did say he came to the island to die and had shut himself off from the force until yoda forced him to be mindful of his lessons. I also understand why people have issues with the story but really felt they needed to go a different way.. I know Hamill prob wanted more but it was time for him to move on. Can\u2019t continue to grow the story around him.. This is Rey\u2019s story not his so it makes sense that there will beginning (TWA) middle (TLJ) and end (episode 9) ","true":true}
