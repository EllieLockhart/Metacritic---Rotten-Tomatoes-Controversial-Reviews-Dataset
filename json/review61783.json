The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I really can't describe how much of a joke this game turned out to be. Seven year wait with a lot of hype surrounding it. Everyone grew to love Joel and Ellie together\\, and their father\/daughter relationship. Then after all these years you release it\\, the sequel to a truly great game. Within two hours Joel dies like a **** rat\\, nothing heroic\\, nothing smart\\, no sacrifice\\, just cold brutal ****\r\rI think everyone knew that Joel was going to die at some point in the game\\, but within 2 hours of a twenty some hour game\\, damn. And they have the **** audacity to have us play as the **** who shot his leg with a shotgun\\, tortured him for several hours and then ending his life infront of Ellie with a **** golf club to the skull. That right there should have been where I stopped playing.\r\rThe slog fest that is the Abby(Joel killer) storyline lasts for 10+ hours\\, even if you rush it which you probably will do\\, since they **** ended Ellie's gameplay on a cliffhanger with Abby about to shoot her\\, after she has just came to kill Ellie. I can't even make this up\\, they force you to play Abby's storyline to make you humanize her\\, but all you can think about is Ellie and the **** cliffhanger. Like who in their right mind gives a flying **** about Abby after you see her beating the **** out of your favorite characters from the earlier game?\r\rI want to wrap this up\\, since it's actually way too much stuff to be said. Basically Ellie moves away to a farm with Dina and her baby\\, far away from everything. She is suffering from PTSD and nightmares about Joel dying. So she sets out to find and kill Abby\\, again. You find her tied up and dying\\, you are also dying. You fight\\, she bites off two of your fingers\\, you hold her under water to drown her\\, but you don't kill her. She drives off in a boat with her kid to join fireflies and attempt to have a good life.\r\rEllie returns to the farm to find the house abandoned. Ellie sits down and plays on the guitar Joel gave her\\, it sounds like **** cause she misses to fingers\\, she puts it down\\, camera pans to window where we see Ellie walking into the horizon. Leaving the only thing she had after Joel died\\, music. She lost her **** girlfriend and Dina's kid\\, basically Ellie's kid\\, and **** Tabby is seemingly living her best life in a town of 200+ people. Roll credit. **** this game. DO NOT BUY IT\u2026 Expand","true":true}
