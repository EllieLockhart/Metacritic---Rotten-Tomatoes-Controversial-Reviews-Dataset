Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everyone is so whiny because the movie was not a predictable \\\"lets blow up the superweapon again\\\" and \\\"my Snoke theory was wrong\/not answered\\\" movie... The movie had flaws but in a very long time I was actually gripped by a star wars move! I loved among other things how Snoke was killed off with no backstory... as was Palpatine in the Return of the Jedi...","true":true}
