Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie missed out on alot of potentially good scenes. Training with Luke\\, the fight Luke and Kylo could have had\\, anything but the casino would be fine\\, I went in with a good amount of knowing what I should get and got a lot of what I didn't want. As take training with Luke for instance. Luke messed up with Ben ( Kylo) also (not something Luke would have done but bad guys come from somewhere) and has a 2nd chance with someone who doesn't want to go to the dark side whay so ever. Saying things like Ben failed you I won't\\, and I need to know my place in all of this and Luke just does nothing\\, the guy who tried then got down on himself then tried again and again and again has once again given up. Now track record should show he needs a little push to try again and kinda does... (not really) and decides to help his sister fight the 1st order... Kinda by facing kylo for to face..... KINDA..... see where I'm going it was lack luster then the originals and the originals had 1\/100 of the technology to help it out and wires and green screens and choreographing abilities that everything could have been on next level and it wasn't... agree or don't agree just my opinion.
