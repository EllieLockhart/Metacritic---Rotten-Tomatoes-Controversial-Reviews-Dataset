Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really liked many aspects of this movie. The \\\"connection\\\" between Ren and Rey\\, the fortitude of Poe Dameron\\, the never give up attitude of Finn\\, as well as other things too numerous to mention. Overall\\, I'm all in on the movie as a worthy chapter of the saga. However\\, there was one area I thought was mishandled: Rey being kept out of action by having to CONVINCE Skywalker to do what is right and necessary for the Rebellion. It seemed like 2\/3 the movie was wasted on something that made no sense. Luke is too strong a character to have him wallow in self pity and doubt like that. It didn't ring true to me. The fight scenes were tremendous. The ending provided hope. Looking forward to the next chapter.","true":true}
