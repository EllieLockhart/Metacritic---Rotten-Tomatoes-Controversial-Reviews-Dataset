Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie itself isn't bad\\, but to me at least\\, it didn't live up to the hype. The movie was lacking in the kind of scenes one would expect from a star wars movie with this cast of characters. Some characters exit the star wars universe in ways that felt rather cheap\\, and the movie continuously built up to moments of tension\\, just to let the tension drop in disappointing ways. There also weren't enough of the actions scenes people have come to love star wars for. If you dislike lightsaber combat\\, you'll love this movie. I saw the force awakens three times in theaters\\, I won't be seeing this one a second time.","true":true}
