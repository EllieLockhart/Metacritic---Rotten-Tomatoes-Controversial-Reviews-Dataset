Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No spoilers ! So you can read the review of just my opinion. I really enjoyed this film. Down side first\\, I don\u2019t think small children will be able to sit through the length of the film without feeling a bit like it\u2019s a long film so keep that in mind. However\\, for me I wish it was longer!! Upside time! The middle of the film gave me a lot of build for characters that I loved and love more now. The visuals did not disappoint\\, it was just beautiful to watch with every scene. I for one test feel that the movie used the empire strikes back as its blueprint\\, which is not a bad thing. You could see the similarities through tour and the lay out of the film\\,but with that said\\, this film was its own masterpiece. Using the lay out to build on its own story and characters to take us on an entire new journey that did not disappoint. If you enjoyed the last film and the original trilogy than you will be very pleased with this experience at the theater in my opinion.","true":true}
