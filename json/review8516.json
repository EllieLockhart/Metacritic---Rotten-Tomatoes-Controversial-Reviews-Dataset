Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First 10 minutes were good\\, then all fell apart. This was the end of Star Wars. I never want to see another made by Disney. Their message in the movie was let it all die. Nothing matters. As for the the critics ratings we can call it fake news. I wish I could get my money back..... By the way this is a real person making this\\, not some computer.","true":true}
