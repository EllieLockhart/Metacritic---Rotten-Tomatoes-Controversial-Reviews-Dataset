Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Marvelous film\\, Alot of twists and turns with plenty of pros with only a few cons.\\nIt shakes up the Star Wars formula\\, much to the chagrin of some die hard fans\\, some may even say that it dosen't feel like a classic Star Wars film. (With alot less fan service than TFA)\\nBut as a die hard fan myself\\, im glad to see the films changing from the standard formula. Im happy not to be stuck in the old days\\, making films for the sakes of fan service.","true":true}
