Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute SJW garbage. Disney is pushing their political agenda instead of trying to be true to the source material. It's seemed as though the writers were shoehorning as much diversity and feminism as the could into this turd. I also noticed that every white male in this film is either evil or dumb or weak. All of these elements become very distracting and also enfuriating. Telling a good story was obviously not a priority for  the latest trilogy (I'm not going to bother watching  episode 9. I'm still upset with myself for sitting through TFA and TLJ!!). Disney\\, Star Wars was manically because it took us to a galaxy far\\, far away. Your last few Star Wars movies Force fed the audience your political agenda\\, SJW propaganda\\, racism (yes\\, RACISM) \\, Star Wars isn't Star Wars anymore. Congratulations Disney\\, you've managed to kill a franchise that was beloved by most. Shame on you. #boycottstarwars","true":true}
