Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"It's not good... simple. This is a perfect example of a game that has great graphics and great gameplay\\, but terrible story. Players want to sympathize with the characters they are playing as. Not play as someone who they utterly hate for 40% of the game. With over 20+ hours of gameplay\\, all you can ask after the beginning section is when is it going to be over. It starts as a revenge story\\, but then it just starts branching out and showing it's stance on different themes in today's world with a character going under a transition from girl to boy\\, and lesbian relationships\\, which in part isn't a bad thing\\, but for the game story to be played out like that\\, it doesn't take the full effect and instead portrays these themes as a joke. It's terrible to see critics loving this game over the graphics and gameplay when a game like this specializes on its story which was perfectly built with the previous title. This game's story is an insult to the last and the advertising for this game is fake since most of the players thought Joel was still going to be around. If this was what they meant to do with the story\\, all I can say is that it was terribly executed by the director and the naughty dog team. This isn't just an insult to the previous tile\\, but also an insult to gaming reviews and the fanbase as a whole.\r\rTL;DR:  4\/10 because gameplay and graphics are pretty good. Everything else is ****\u2026 Expand","true":true}
