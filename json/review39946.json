Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is hands down the worst star-wars ever!!!! Disney should be ashamed. The plot was terrible... the movie was too long and had no direction... they also managed to destroy Luke Skywalker as a decent character. I think Disney just wants to make money because they didn't put any quality into this movie... this is destroying the star wars franchise. ","true":true}
