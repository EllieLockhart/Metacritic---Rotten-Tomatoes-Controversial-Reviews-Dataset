Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is not bad because it didn't aim to please the fan base. It is bad because it was poorly written and executed. \\n\\nThe least we could expect was that Rian Johnson would develop the great characters that were introduced in TFA. Well\\, he didn't! It seems as if he considered them to be boring or useless and just decided to kill them or ignore them. \\n\\nBeyond that\\, the movie is filled with bad humour and plot holes. It is simply dissapointing.","true":true}
