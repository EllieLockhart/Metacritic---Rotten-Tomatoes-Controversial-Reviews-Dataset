Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What did you watch? This movie and director were bold. Tying the Battlefront II game into was awesome for the true fan as well. We have to end this story that began in 1977 and begin a new chapter. It's sad to see people go but as Luke says nothing truly leaves. In 1980 people were pissed because we had to wait 3 years to find out what happened to not only Han but is Darth Vader truly Luke's father. And a big hats off to Bencio Del Toro\\, he is great wish his part was bigger. Everyone let go off your emotions and give it another chance\\, remember like Empire there is another one to go. This movie took some chances just like Empire (which I agree with Harrison Ford that Han should've died in that movie but Lucas just couldn't take that giant leap) that is why this movie is only behind Empire in Star Wars greatness!!!!!!","true":true}
