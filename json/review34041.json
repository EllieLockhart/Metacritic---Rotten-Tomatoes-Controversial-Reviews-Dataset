Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible. Worse than the prequels.\\nCringey one liners\\, corny jokes\\, Leia flying through space\\, Snoke being some \\\"Ultimate Evil\\\" but then being defeated in a matter of seconds\\, no explanation for who Snoke is or how he gained power\\, tons of plot holes\\, no cohesive story. Did not fit into the Star Wars Universe.\\n\\nI am appalled how this got so many raving critic reviews.","true":true}
