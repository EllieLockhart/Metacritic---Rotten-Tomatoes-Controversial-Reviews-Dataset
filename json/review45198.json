Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unlike the last movie which was pretty much the same story as New Hope. This movie was unpredictable and sets up the third movie in this trilogy well. It was a little long but I think the movie was very well done.","true":true}
