Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"two and a half hours and a major let down. watching Finn run around a casino was pointless. the only meaningful points of the movie were scenes with kylo and Rey. I expected more action like light Sabre battles force using then what we got for two and a half hours. rian Johnson dropped the ball here and I have great fears for his trilogy ","true":true}
