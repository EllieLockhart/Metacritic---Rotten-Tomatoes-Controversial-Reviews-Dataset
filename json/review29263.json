Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rewatched the prequels again after watching TLJ twice. Even if we overlook the  Inferior space battles\\, sword fights\\, horrible humor and plot holes. TLJ did almost nothing for the audience to be invested in any of the characters or factions\\, overpowered Rey with no struggle\\, wasted and neglected sub-plot build ups from the Force awaken. The greatest sin is the way they handled Luke Skywalker\\, it is fine that they wanted to change him\\, to make him lose hope and develop his character arc to a darker side\\, but it has to be convincing\\, and also redeem his character in the end\\, even Darth Vader has a better ending than Luke Skywalker. One can always defend and say maybe his redemption will be in the next film\\, but why do that ? I feel very sorry for Mark Hamil himself\\, to have his most iconic role character having such a disgraceful end.","true":true}
