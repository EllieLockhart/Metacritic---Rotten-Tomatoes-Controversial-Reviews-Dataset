Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok\\, I am a huge Star Wars fan\\, and I could not believe how much backlash this movie received\\, I understand some frustrations with some questions raised by Force Awakens either not being answered at all or the answer being underwhelming however this does not change that this movie is a great addition and a really fresh take on Star Wars in a way which expands the universe. I love this movie as a Star Wars fan who watched it dressed as a Jedi and as a fan of films in general. This movie does not stop surprising you and takes huge risks that should be applauded. I think however the issue comes with the sense of disrespect of the message the movie gives to fans and fan theories\\, as if they don't matter. In a way it makes some of the greater things of force awakens not seem as important. Yes that hurt but you learn to build thick skin and irrespective of these issues along with some cringy moments with some characters it doesn't change that this is a great film that not only challenges the norms of the Star Wars lore but traditional filmmaking as well. Go watch this movie\\, it is one of the best in the series hands down. Forget everything you've been told just go watch to enjoy it as a whole and you'll love it\\, if you go with a mind to see what all the hate is about then you'll find plenty to pick on as a hardcore Star Wars fan who has certain notions on how characters should be but not as a film fan.","true":true}
