Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall\\, I didn't hate this movie\\, but I also didn't really like it. The opening scene was exciting. The Yoda cameo was great to see also. However\\, I didn't really like what they copied from previous Star Wars movies and didn't like the pieces of the plot they decided to change. My biggest problem with this movie was the characters\\, I didn't like the direction they took any character's arc. Rey and Kylo are now less interesting and less complicated. Luke's portrayal was also strange. They turned Poe into an unlikable dick. Benicio del Toro\\, Laura Dern\\, Rose\\, Snoke\\, and Captain Phasma were all useless characters that contributed nothing\\, had no development\\, and were throwaway characters to me. I honestly don't know what direction they are going here and maybe this movie will age well. Again\\, it was not an awful movie\\, but I expect a lot more from a film that bears the name Star Wars.","true":true}
