Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm sure even George Lucas was shaking his head after seeing this atrocious mess. This film was an insult to the previous films\\, the lore\\, and the fans. Shame on Rian Johnson and Disney for this abomination. They took pretty much every anticipated plot point from The Force Awakens and answers them in the worst possible ways. I have never been so disappointed in a Star Wars film\\, and yes that includes the lackluster prequels.","true":true}
