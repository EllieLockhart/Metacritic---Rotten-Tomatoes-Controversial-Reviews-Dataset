Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many other reviews nailed the same feeling I have. I wanted to love it. I was entertained. But ultimately\\, they just botched any build up they generated from episode 7. I'm so bothered right now at what they did here. How could the writing have been so good recently with episode 7 and the Rogue One spin off and then... this garbage. GAH?!!!","true":true}
