Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dreadful hole ridden preachy pile that drags on far too long. Thanks Disney\\, war is bad. Thanks Disney white men are responsible for all the ills in the universe. Thanks Disney rich people sit together gambling at opulent casinos while they abuse animals and children. Thanks Disney\\, Mon Calimari should stop squidsplaining to purple haired SJW admirals who know it all but share nothing and let 1\/2 their fleet die before deciding to turn a capital ship into a missile ... which no other tactical genius like Ackbar had thought of in 8 prior movies. Oh Luke is a crying wuss also\\, because white man. Oh hey the movie ends where it begins with quasi rebels basically moving a few planets over after running\\, really ... really ... slowly ... for 3 hours. What a complete mess with no character development\\, a dumb plot and nothing resolved.","true":true}
