Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning\\, horribly written and acted piece of propaganda that intentionally dumps 40 years of Star Wars history into the trash bin. I'll agree with Kevin Smith's assessment that the Luke-R2 scene was great\\, and Daisy Ridley's acting is admirable given the script limitations\\, but otherwise this film completely misses the mark.\\n\\nDisney would be better off canceling plans for IX and going back to the drawing board. Character development was nonexistent. Every male character is a buffoon. The 'strong' female characters suffer from Mary Sue syndrome.\\n\\nIf you are looking for strong female leads\\, go back to Carrie Fisher's Leia in the original\\, or go see Wonder Woman again. \\n\\nNone of these characters -- Finn\\, Poe Dameron\\, Admiral Holdo\\, Rey\\, Snoke\\, on and on -- show emotional or intellectual development. And the entire movie suffers as a result.\\n\\nIf this wasn't a Star Wars film it would be the biggest box office bomb of all time. But Disney is rapidly eroding fan support for the brand -- core or otherwise.","true":true}
