Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnsson just killed Star Wars! Disney just killed Star Wars!\\, how can you fail so misserably in telling the most important part of the story in the new trilogy. This movie was suppossed to fix the lose ends not just making a 1000 new ones. This has to be the biggest disappointment for me in 2017.","true":true}
