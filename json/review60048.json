Where the first one was very tightly focused on two characters\\, this one is much broader with a lot more moving parts. It subverts a lot of video game tropes and it really does force you to confront the actions of the main character. It starts out with a fairly straightforward revenge premise and ends up going in all kinds of directions before returning to it with radically changed characters. It's a long and exhausting journey\\, and so very worth it if you leave your assumptions at the door.\r\rIt's not a game for everyone - as the reviews seem to show - but if you enjoy emotional and moral challenges and don't see everything in black and white\\, then I can wholeheartedly recommend it.\r\rThe graphics and gameplay are both improved over the original\\, with some truly spectacular visuals and very involving set-pieces.\r\rIt does suffer from some of the same issues the first one had\\, however. A few fights (especially with the infected) rely a bit too much on getting lucky or trial-and-erroring your way through the environment\\, and there is one boss fight which can be frustrating until you find the right place to fight it. There are also one or two flashback sections which might have been worked better at different points in the overall narrative\\, but given how ambitious the storytelling is\\, I can forgive this.\r\rIf you loved the first one and can go into the second with an equally open mind\\, then you'll love this. Just be prepared to be made uncomfortable by some parts of the game - they do pay off but you're going to come out of this game with very different emotions than you did with the first one.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
