Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"a brilliant film\\, plot between rae and ben will keep you second guessing what is going to happen between them\\, and film wasso good you didnt feel like you had sat there for over 2 and half hours","true":true}
