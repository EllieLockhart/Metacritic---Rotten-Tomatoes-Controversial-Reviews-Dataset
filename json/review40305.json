Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is one of the best movies of the saga after the original trilogy. The movie hits you right in the feels in some places\\, and apart from one unnecessary subplot\\, it pretty much does its job. Amazing dialogues and acting make it feel like a star wars movie that can stand out on it's own. It does borrow from Empire (like Force Awakens did from A New Hope)\\, but very cleverly. \\n\\nAs a long time Star Wars fan\\, I don't really understand some of the criticism it's getting. Although a bit long\\, it's a movie which does a good job at satisfying it's old fans and impressing the new ones as well\\, which a Star Wars movie should be doing. That's all I guess\\, May the Force Be With You. Always.","true":true}
