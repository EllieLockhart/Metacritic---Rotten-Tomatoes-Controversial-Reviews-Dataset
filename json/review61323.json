Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game nearly broke me. I was so conflicted while playing. I couldn\u2019t abide by the anger and revenge Ellie wouldn\u2019t let go of. I was so livid having to start again as Abby. And overall it was just so **** harrowing and sad. I snot-cried at the end. But I FELT that emotion so many times throughout. Tension\\, excitement\\, glee\\, happiness\\, sadness\\, frustration\\, fear\\, sweetness. I went through all those emotions and more. I couldn\u2019t wait to see what was next. And I loved the risks in storytelling. I loved the women protagonists kicking ass. I loved the Scars whistling. I loved the lush environment. I loved the gameplay and stealth (OMG did I love the stealth mechanics). Would have been fun to film myself for my gleeful reactions to vicious sneaky stealth kills and then right after I\u2019m upset that I had to smash Nora and audibly yelling \u201cSTOP ELLIE I don\u2019t want to do this\u201d at the final fight with Abby. Clearly\\, this game worked and it really got to me. It\u2019s a masterpiece.Incredible piece of media. One that will outlast all this wild vitriol some of the Internet is tossing at it. The two games together are some of the best media i have ever engaged with. Thanks Naughty Dog!!!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
