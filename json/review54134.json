Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed it and my husband thought it was average. Of course we will continue to see every movie about Star Wars in the theater though! He wanted to know more about Snoke's backstory and I agree. This powerful Sith came out of nowhere? Maybe hire a writer like a J.K. Rowling type to figure out the plot and backstory of new characters way in advance? The flow felt a little disjointed and focusing on the storyline might help. How about injecting some Martial Arts choreography into the light saber battles like Darth Maul or Donnie Yen? I liked the all of the cute animals and appreciate Johnson's twists and turns and awesome visuals.\\n\\nUPDATE: after going back and rewatching the prequels\\, I will add another 2 cents on whether to watch. \\n\\nIf you like continuous epic sagas\\, like Lord of the Rings\\, about universes with established lore and mythology\\, and you want to watch Star Wars\\, watch 1-3\\, then Rogue One (which is 3.5) then 4-6. Then stop.\\n\\nIf you aren't too worried about originality but enjoy a fun\\, nostalgic\\, swashbuckling adventure with modern special effects and casting\\, watch 7.\\n\\nIf you like pretty cinematography\\, introspection\\, trendy modern literature\\, and themes like failure\\, growth\\, belonging\\, purpose\\, etc.\\, then you'll probably like 8.","true":true}
