Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed watching the Last Jedi.  Great action scenes.  A good story with some great character development.  Poe had some great character flaws and development.  Finn's emotional development was interesting.  It was nice to see some new twists with some old characters.  Definitely worth seeing in the theater.","true":true}
