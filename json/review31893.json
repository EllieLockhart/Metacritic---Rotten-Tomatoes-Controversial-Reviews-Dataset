Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILER ALERT: This movie is at best just a stand-alone Star Wars movie..it ruins the Star Wars Mythos. I don\u2019t know why Rian Johnson decided to go this direction...OH WAIT! I know why!! Cuz he\u2019s in charge of writing another new trilogy that has nothing to do with these characters!! Thanks for ruining the original Star Wars!! And ruining JJ Abrams vision!! What a selfish director","true":true}
