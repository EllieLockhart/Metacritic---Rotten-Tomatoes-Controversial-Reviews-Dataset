The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"*SPOILERS INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW*\r\rIgnore the obvious review-bombing by unhappy fans that were pissed about Joel getting a golf club taken to his head. If you're mad that a fan favorite character was killed\\, and you expected him to be a hero\\, you completely missed the point of the first game\\, and this one as well. Joel was a **** monster. He massacred an entire hospital worth of people who could have cured the virus\\, just because he couldn't bear losing Ellie. That's disgustingly selfish. With this game\\, while I do understand that playing as the character who killed Joel could piss off a lot of people\\, the writers intended for us to see both sides of the story.  In Abby's world\\, Ellie and Joel are the villains. Joel murdered her father\\, and she wanted revenge. The events of the first game set up this cycle. There is a proverb that states \\\"When you embark on a journey of revenge\\, be sure to dig two graves.\\\"\r\rI also can't praise the environments\\, the lighting\\, animations\\, and design of this game. It is an absolute visual masterpiece.\r\rMy final thoughts on this game are: It was dark\\, like Requiem for a Dream dark. It is not meant to be a feel good story. At times it can be downright disturbing. But at the end of it\\, I was left with a feeling of satisfaction. Do I think the ending made sense the way it happened? In my view\\, unless Abby and Ellie killed each other at the end\\, the way it actually ended was the only way it could have ended. I don't know what's in store for LoU3\\, but I'll damn sure be waiting with baited breath for what will hopefully be a fantastic conclusion to an amazing story.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
