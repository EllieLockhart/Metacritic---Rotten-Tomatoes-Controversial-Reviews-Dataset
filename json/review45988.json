Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually impressive.  However storytelling is poor. Also lots of plot holes abd things that just defy the laws of physics. Like bombs dropping in space...hello...no gravity.  And flying Leia is a travesty to the character of Leia and the abilities of Force.  But listen kids...it doesn't have to be good as long as jt makes a lot of money.  \\n\\nRegarding the SJW aspect\\, Kathleen Kennedy needs to walk the walk and not just talk the talk.  Is there not a female director\\, screenwriter for the franchise?  \\n\\nGoing in to the film\\, my biggest fear was that Mark Hamill's acting abilities would ruin the memory of a much beloved character.  My fears were misplaced.  Hamill did a very good job bringing an aged bedi master to the screen.  It was everythjng else I should have worried about  Han Solo said it best in TFA....the Force doesnt work like that.   Someone should tell Ms. Kennedy how the Force works.\\n\\nBut who cares....it will make a lot of money.  I just hope a great deal of that money goes to supporting the SJW issues the movie puts forth....human trafficking\\,  animal cruelty\\, science education for women and minorities\\, female leadership development.  \\n\\nOn that note\\, a big and sincere thank you to George Lucas for his philanthropic support of social issues and education.","true":true}
