Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An unparalleled mess of a film. Full of plot holes\\, dull characters\\, ponderous heavy handed virtue signaling and humour that falls way\\, way off the mark. Star Wars is now a husk that draws heavily from the bank of nostalgia; milking the fan base that has supported it over the decades in the process. I am one fan who has had enough. It's nothing short of vandalism.","true":true}
