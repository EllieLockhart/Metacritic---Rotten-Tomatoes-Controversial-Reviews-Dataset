Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very nice visually but how this script made it all the way to the theather is a mystery. I have never found so many dumb plotholes when watching a movie... and the handling of Luke was insulting for someone who grew up with OT. Clearly the weakest of the SW movies.","true":true}
