Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Truly fantastic film. It's unexpected and there's a lot to process\\, but I'm hopeful many of the disappointed fans will come around on this one with time and some rewatches. Did Rian make a movie that's too emotionally complex for Star Wars fans?! I'm glad he went where he did and I really hope this backlash doesn't prevent him from setting up another trilogy\\, because I think he can do even better with a blank slate than he did having to pick up JJs threads (and I loved TFA). Thank you\\, Rian!","true":true}
