Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the first time in my entire life as a fan that I have been so disappointed by a Star Wars film... and I was there for the pre-quels! JJ Abrams may have made a \\\"safe\\\" movie in The Force Awakens\\, but he set up fun and interesting characters with great story points...all of which are purposefully wasted in this film. \\\"Subverting audience\\\" expectation is great in orchestrated moderation but Rian Johnsons style is \\\"twist\\\" over plot\\, character and enjoyment. Features a slow pointless main plot with various side-plots that are completely and infuriatingly also pointless. Takes pride in disrespecting anything fans cared about in their lifelong fandom including throwing aside traditions and characters. If the movie offered anything new and interesting in its place it would be one thing\\, but at the end you are left feeling devoid of enjoyment or interest in this bland\\, vexing\\, exercise in wheels spinning futility. I find myself unsure whether I care about anything left in the movie universe enough to watch a third film. It truly feels like a movie made by someone who HATES Star Wars and wanted to ruin the franchise and any moments I appreciated are lost to my memory under the weight of this horribly constructed pile of bantha fodder movie.","true":true}
