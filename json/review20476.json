Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a Star Wars fan for many\\, many years\\, and had the pleasure of watching Empire and Return in the theaters when they came out. This installment left me leaving the theater asking \\\"what the hell just happened!?\\\" There are so many issues that it's hard to list them out. No real continuity and so much did not make sense. All in all\\, this movie felt forced and as if 30+ people were trying to direct it all at the same time. I encourage people to go and see the movie for themselves\\, but I don't hold any misconception that when they do\\, they will come to a different end result.","true":true}
