Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi is the worst Star Wars movie up to date. Every single second of it was horrendous and revolting. The complete disregard for the original\\, and even the prequel trilogy is mind blowing. It ruins all the characters\\, and has some do what they would never do. It's a middle finger to everything Star Wars\\, and SHOULD be ridiculed\\, and SHOULD be forgotten.","true":true}
