The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"While the game's accessibility is among the best out there\\, providing a gateway for those less skilled and a challenge to those looking for a thrill\\, as well as looking and sounding phenomenal in terms of graphics\\, sound design\\, music and voice acting\\, the story felt shallow and pointless the whole way through\\, the gameplay loop can become repetitive\\, and with an unlikable character you're forced to play as for half the game getting the win in the end\\, I never at any point felt satisfied with how the story played out. I nearly cried at some scenes\\, genuinely smiled at others\\, but after leaving\\, I left with no real impact from the game's messages and tone\\, mostly since it seems like a game that came out ten years too late with its \\\"revenge and violence are never the answer\\\" themes. If you wanted me to feel bad for killing the people trying to kill me\\, the right decision is to let me understand them through the eyes of the person they've hurt most\\, Ellie\\, and let me decide their fates.\r\rWhat we have instead is a game that\\, at every turn\\, tells you that people must die to progress the story\\, then shifts focus in a shallow attempt at making you feel guilty for playing the game. Niel Druckman mentioned that this game wasn't meant to be fun. And truthfully\\, that is exactly true for this game\\, he hit the nail on the head. In that regard\\, he has my respect. But I am of the camp of people who firmly believe that players should have some input or incentive to play the game. If you do not make the game fun\\, people will stop playing. People will quit halfway through\\, and the story you've created would no longer matter\\, simply because there were more gripping stories out there\\, or more engaging games.\r\rIf you wanted to create a movie\\, then create a movie. But it isn't one I would want to watch. I'm a more grown person now\\, one who can appreciate many things about a game. But if I cannot have any fun in the supposed magnum opus\\, the greatest masterpiece of all time\\, then maybe it doesn't deserve to be called a masterpiece after all. It's flawed in story\\, gameplay\\, and even emotion. Because at the end of the day\\, I left it feeling completely thoughtless. It felt like a mediocre fanfiction. I can appreciate the game for what it's done on a standpoint of presentation and accessibility. But nothing beyond that.\r\rIn summary\\, The Last of Us 2 is a visual and auditory spectacle\\, but that's about all you're getting; spectacle. With how much blood is shed and guts are spilled\\, it's baffling how little this game shocked me with any plot beats or twists\\, or even in terms of its visual style. Truthfully\\, in a decade or so\\, this game's graphical achievements will be trumped by something else. And when that happens\\, it will fade into nothing but a memory for me.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
