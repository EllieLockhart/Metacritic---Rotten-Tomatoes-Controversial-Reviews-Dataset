Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a very beautiful movie.  The art director should win awards.  Apart from that\\, watching this movie is a hostile experience.  As one review put it\\, it feels like \\\"a huge middle finger to anyone who grew up believing in Luke Skywalker\\\".  \\n\\nI get it: Disney wants a Star Wars universe where anybody can be a hero.  That gives them a lot more opportunity to create new Star Wars material without having to hinge everything on the Skywalker family.  Makes perfect business sense to me.  (And if you don't think that's the ONLY thing that really matters here\\, you're fooling yourself.)  \\n\\nSome will love this movie for the strong female characters\\, the laughs\\, and the utter breaking of convention.  I say if you can only make women strong by making men weak\\, then your women are weak.  I say laughs are great\\, but \\\"Star Wars\\\" is not \\\"Guardians of the Galaxy\\\".  And I say that everything this movie accomplishes for the Star Wars universe could have accomplished better - and without destroying everything that came before.\\n\\nWorst Star Wars movie ever.","true":true}
