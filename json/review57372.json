Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie really was disappointing\\, and I had no expectations going into it other than a halfway competent story that might clean up some issues with the last movie. Unfortunately it does the opposite\\, and just presents more plot holes and issues than before. This movie is an insult to the original trilogy with how it ruins Luke Skywalker as a character. Rey is still a terribly written \\\"do-all\\\" character\\, and she's meant to be the main character. Kylo Ren is the saving grace of this movies\\, and the scenes with him in it are overall worth seeing\\, but coupled with the rest of this movie\\, I just can't recommend wasting your time with it. The biggest issue was wasted potential. This movie could have been more\\, and it was building up to it\\, but it left use with a completely awful ending that provides no satisfaction\\, no suspense\\, and no hope for the next movie.","true":true}
