Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I wanted to like Last of Us part 2 more than I did. The game has so much going for it. Beautiful graphics\\, excellent animations\\, talented actors\\, an almost perfect part one story and character development\\, an excellent composer. None of these were used to any great effect in part 2. The story in part 2 or maybe the storytelling completely missed the mark. If the main theme was to understand that heroes and good guys are matter of perspective the storytelling utterly failed. Had I been introduced to Abby before she killed Joel I could have grown to like her. Then maybe when she did kill Joel\\, I would feel conflicted instead of hatred and scorn. The first part did so well at making you care about characters despite how little time was given to their story. I cared about Sara\\, Sam\\, Tess\\, Henry before they were lost to the harsh reality of the apocalypse. When playing as Abby I just wanted to speed through the story. Seeing all the people and characters I killed as Ellie did give me a tinge of regret (side note\\, I avoided killing any dogs until was forced to kill Alice which was disappointing). But for Abby I felt nothing. Most infuriating\\, I had to play as Abby when fighting Ellie. Literally I was shaking my head and muttering to myself \u201cNo...\u201d repeatedly. Maybe thats a testament to how good the story was in part 1 and how lacking it is in part 2. Great storytelling can humanize the worst of villains. I am sad to say\\, the storytelling so missed the mark that what\u2019s great about this game is dragged down by the storytelling. I must say also I feel manipulated  by the trailers that character swapped Jessy for Joel. I was already willing to believe Joey was dead and would only appear in visions but when that scene arrived\\, and Jessy appeared I felt cheated out of another excellent performance from Ashley and Troy. Visually this game is stunning. Gameplay it\u2019s okay. Storywise it\u2019s abysmal.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
