Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Brilliant  cinematography and of course John Williams developed another wonderful score for the movie. However\\, beyond that the plot and development of the story is what kept this entry from shining. Most every plot line people were excited about from TFA was jettisoned in this installment. Somehow we were supposed to connect and care about characters that only got a handful of minutes of screen time. So much time wasted  on creating gag and slapstick moments I left scratching my head because I didn't know what kind of movie this was trying to be. I think the answer ultimately has to do with the last scene which is more reminiscent of a Star Wars Christmas toy TV ad.","true":true}
