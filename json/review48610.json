Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worse than the prequels!\\n\\nThe movie was horribly written and disrespected the legacy of the original star wars trilogy and the most of all the fans. The characters didn't act like them self and there were gigantic plot wholes that no one can ever hope to fix.\\nIf you haven't watched it yet don't watch it\\, you will be better of remembering the good originals instead of this mess of a movie.","true":true}
