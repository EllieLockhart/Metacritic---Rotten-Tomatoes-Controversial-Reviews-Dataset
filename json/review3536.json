Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Best star wars movie ever. Better then force awakens and empire strikes back. Did not disappoint. Yeah their was humor but who doesn\u2019t like laughing.
