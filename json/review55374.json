Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it! This movie is the analog of The Empire Strikes Back in this trilogy\\, Empire has the most famous twists in movie history (\\\"I am your father\\\") and is the low point for the characters that sets up Return of The Jedi. Think of all three movies in the trilogy as one long Rocky movie\\, in the middle of the Rocky movie\\, Rocky is getting pummeled on the mat only to rise up to glory by the end of the movie\\, or the third installment of this trilogy. All that said\\, they couldn't just re-do Empire\\, so there was a lot of new twists in this one\\, which also expanded the powers of the force compared to the last movies. In addition\\, this movie broke away from the idea of inherited Jedi power\\, implying that anyone could be a Jedi\\, no matter who your parents are or where you come from\\, and lastly\\, they showed how small acts of RESISTANCE can inspire others\\, and I expect that will lead to victory in the last movie. (The entire word \\\"resistance\\\" was capitalized in the word scroll at the beginning...)\\n\\nBeyond all this\\, the movie was visually stunning\\, added a bunch of fun new creatures\\, it was funny and heart wrenching at the same time\\, there were a bunch of Easter eggs for fans\\, the actors that play Rey and Finn are such great actors\\, and it was bitter sweet to see Carrie Fisher as Leia one last time... So much good imo.","true":true}
