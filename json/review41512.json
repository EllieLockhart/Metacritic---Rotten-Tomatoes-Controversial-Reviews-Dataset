Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is beautifully done. It's filled with interesting and necessary surprises that help push the new main characters of the saga to where they need to be. It will win over a new generation of fans. As a long time fan of the original trilogy\\, I enjoyed the ride. Kylo Ren and Rey are the most interesting new characters thus far. Their dynamic and connection stole the show. I hope we see more of it.","true":true}
