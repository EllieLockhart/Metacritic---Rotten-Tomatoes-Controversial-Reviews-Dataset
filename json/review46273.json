Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was amazing. People just need to calm down and enjoy the movie it might not be what you wanted it to be but that doesn\u2019t make it bad. And for the people saying that there\u2019s to many plot holes. They have Episode 9 to fill in the gaps. Oh and it\u2019s visually amazing. Also you all said The Force Awakens was too much like A New Hope make the next one original then you complain that this one is to different. Please make up your minds. ","true":true}
