Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In a movie that sets up failure for practically every character (except Rey which is a small flaw) it is incredibly interesting that this movie is also \u201cfailing\u201d in the box office (which is laughable) and a \u201cfailure\u201d with its audience. I love that the audience still can\u2019t recognize that this movie is all about failure. We are not supposed to like what happened in this movie. Just like in Empire\\, we weren\u2019t supposed to like what happened with Luke and Vader\\, or Han Solo getting frozen in carbonite. And OBVIOUSLY questions are left unanswered. There is another 2 hour movie coming that needs to have some intrigue. ","true":true}
