Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was 11 in '77. Star Wars moved me and was fond memory from my childhood. I want to say up front\\, that I understand that sometimes heroes die. I fully expected Han's death in the force awakens. It serves the plot. In order for a villain to be elevated in comparison to the ultimate villain\\, Darth Vader. While I am not a giant fan of the Force Awakens\\, it step up some really interesting plot lines I was excited to see answered. There was also some cool characters I wanted to lean more about thought this trilogy. I am so disappointed\\, and disillusioned now with this franchise. This movie paid no respect to what came in the past\\, there was no really meaningful character growth\\, and my just throwing out what JJ set up\\, no questions left to be answered in Episode 9. I know there is a lot of people that love this move\\, and to make money\\, they need to pull in new fans. But this should have been in a way that respected the rules of what the force is\\, who Luke had become\\, and the mysticism of what this fairytail was. Star Wars died for me on December 15\\,\\, 2017. I will still watch the movies\\, but the bar\\, for me\\, is so low\\, I don't know how Disney might turn this around.","true":true}
