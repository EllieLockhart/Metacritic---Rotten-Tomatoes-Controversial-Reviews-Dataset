Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too politicized\\, SJW messages\\, doesn't follow Star Wars at the core of it.  Good graphics and nice looking movie but the political under tones and forced gender and ethnic diversity is too much.","true":true}
