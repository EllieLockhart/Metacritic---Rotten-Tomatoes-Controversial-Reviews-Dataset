Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Definitely succeeded in killing the past complete disregard for the original trilogy. Too many social agendas\\, not enough story development. Character inconsistencies. A completely forced love story between Fin and Rose. Didn't get to see Luke as a badass Jedi master. Too much more to mention\\, summation\\, I won't pay to see anymore stars wars movies. Rian Johnson and Emo Ren succeeded\\, childhood dead!","true":true}
