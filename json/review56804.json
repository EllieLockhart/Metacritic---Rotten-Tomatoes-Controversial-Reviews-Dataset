Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The people who complain have bad reasons for not liking the movie. Really stupid reasons. Just read their reviews... done ok. You can tell just by reading their reviews that they had crazy expectations\\, you should also be able to see their personalities in their reviews. This should reflect less on the movie and more on them. They just shouldn't be recommending movies to anyone. They have bad reasoning. \\n\\nThis movie was fun\\, unexpected\\, and quality. There character development was key. The story didn't cover as much as I am used to but IT WAS A NEW MOVIE. NOT A REMAKE OR REHASH SOME MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED. I mean if you really thought Luke was out of character it just shows how little you know about acting. Mark is a bad @ss.  You can't watch\/hear him and say\\,\\\"bad performance.\\\" You could but people would call you dumb. I mean he could sit in a corner blank faced and he'd pull it off. It character development. Moron. It's what happens to characters on screen for more than a couple moments. Great movie. I assure you even the bs haters will watch it again. And so will you. Go.","true":true}
