Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't mind change\\, but lots of the decisions made for this film didn't make sense at all.  It's left the trilogy in a mess.  What with the unexplained parts in the Force Awakens and now just huge parts of this film leaving you scratching your head\\, it's very disappointing.  This film did not get the balance right\\, in keeping the fan base happy and making it accessible to a wider audience.  After waiting nearly 40 years to see what became of my childhood hero Luke 'galaxy saviour' Skywalker\\, I'm left disillusioned.  StarWars is a classic fairytale\\, not a political commentary on 21st century western social angst.  Yes the dialogue has never been top-notch\\, but did we need a fallen idol\\, bitter and twisted?  \\nSo many things could have been done with this trilogy\\, it really is a missed opportunity.  When ep IX I'll probably go watch the competing film.  The magic of StarWars has fizzled for me.  This is a Johnson of a movie sadly.","true":true}
