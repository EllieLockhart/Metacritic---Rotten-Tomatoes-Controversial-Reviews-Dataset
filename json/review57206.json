Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie broke me in a way that is hard to describe. I really loved it leaving the theatre\\, opening night. I was excited to talk about this film with all my SW friends\\, and then I posted on FB my love for this film. At the time it barely edged out ROTJ as my fav\\, but I quickly began to see the backlash\\, even that night. A friend I barely spoke with from college almost immediately responded to poo poo the film and my opinion. I have listened to and sort of understand peoples issues\\, but I have purchased the film and revisited it multiple times and it is still one of my favorite films in the franchise. While simultaneously being the film that is making me hate SW because it paradoxically brought out the worst of the worst of fandom. This film is a strange beast for me\\, because I simultaneously loved it while it showed me how trash SW fans can be :(","true":true}
