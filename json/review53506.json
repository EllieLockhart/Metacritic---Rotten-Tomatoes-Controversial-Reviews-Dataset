Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily the best Star Wars since the original trilogy\\, it's not even close.  The story was character-driven. You did not get a hundred different Muppets or droids you didn't need. The action actually moves the story along instead of stalling it. It's a little funny\\, a little touching\\,  a little \\\"oh hey man that's cool.\\\" But most importantly it's a solid movie\\,  it's a solid movie that happens to take place in the Star Wars universe\\,  and does not seem to try and live up to some preconceived notion of what a Star Wars movie needs to be.","true":true}
