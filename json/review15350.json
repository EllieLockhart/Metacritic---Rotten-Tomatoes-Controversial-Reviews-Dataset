Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved and hated TLJ all at the same time. Perhaps Mark Hamil's comments were most apt in saying this is not the Luke or Star Wars the older fans know. The story arc has gone in a totally different direction (somewhat incoherently at times) and you will have to decide if this is still the far far away galaxy you want to be a part of.","true":true}
