The game treats Ellie like trash turning her from a joyful pun loving character to someone from the DCEU. Last of Us 2 goes from  a linear game to a small hub open world for one section only just to go back to a linear game\\, which was disappointing as there are no real alternate paths to lead to same goal or small area for weapons\/resources. the two characters have different weapons and ability upgrades which was ice for the first play through i wish on new game plus the both characters got the others weapons and some of the crafting skills\\, as i really liked the crossbow and the incendiary shotgun shells. if you really want to play this wait for it to go on deep sale or borrow from someone who has it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
