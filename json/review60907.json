The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"As a very big fan of the story of the first game\\, i have to say that not only i feel insulted\\, but also disappointed. Story is a very clich\u00e9 revenge story\\, where you are forced to kill people you don\u2019t care about and them forced to feel bad about\\, even when again\\, these characters are so disposable\\, that you cant feel any emotion when they die. Gameplay is the same from the first game\\, with a few new puzzles\\, plus the old ones that were already stale. After 7 years\\, the AI is just as dumb\\, they still do the same kind of patrolling\\, and you can still strangle someone while they scream next to another npc that doesnt notice. The soundtrack and the graphics are amazing\\, and those are what gives this review the positive points. Santaolalla\u2019s soundtrack is outstanding. The game relies too much on the story\\, so much that some sections are just walk from point a to point b\\, watch a cutscene\\, get the same encounter where you can sneak against some enemies\\, and repeat. For a character that doesnt forget a guy that insults her and giver her free food in the apocalypse\\, it doesn't lake sense that she would forgive the person who killed her father figure. Abby\u2019s sections feel forced and you never get to feel sad for her. You already saw her father\u2019s death as a consequence for a tough decision\\, and again\\, every time you play as her\\, you just want the section to end. The flashbacks are the best and i would prefer to just play those instead of the rest of the story.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
