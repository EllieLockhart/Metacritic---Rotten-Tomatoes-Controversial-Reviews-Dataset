Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was outstanding. Have loved Star Wars since I was a child. I can\u0092t believe people are on here saying it\u0092s terrible or stupid\\, I genuinely don\u0092t get it\\, and to be honest I feel bad for them. For me\\, I got so hyped watching this movie my heart was beating out of my chest. Yes\\, the movie does look and feel different\\, yes\\, it does take risks and try new things\\, and a lot of people aren\u0092t open to that but if you want to see an amazing\\, emotional\\, epic installment in the Star Wars series\\, keep an open mind and go see it.","true":true}
