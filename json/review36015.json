{"101487":175651,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi seeks not only to satiraize Star Wars\\, but to ultimately destroy its past to pave the way for a new superhero universe. This movie makes it abundantly clear its intent to prostitute an iconic story of doubt\\, self sacrifice\\, questioning your true nature and holding fast to your beliefs to provide the creative breathing room for an new\\, endless\\, bastardized saga with cool action scenes\\, punctuated by obtuse merchandising opportunities. Complete with all the cringeworthy quips and forced comedy of all the favorite superhero serials\\nBy all means\\, watch this movie to see what becomes of a beloved franchise once its traded and becomes cooperate on a story level.\\nIf\\, however\\, you are a Star Wars fan and you've ever more than one Marvel\/DC movie and disliked the rehashed formula presented to you in every reiteration\\, I'd recommend you skip this one and go to IMDB top 250 and watch something there.","true":true}
