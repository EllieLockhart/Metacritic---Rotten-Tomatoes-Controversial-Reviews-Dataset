Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It depends which way you want the series to go.  I can see both sides of this movie.  It seems like Disney is certainly producing what they want.  Yes Star Wars is about family\\, but this seemed like a watered down try at Empire.  It's good in spots\\, but not good enough.  Yoda and Luke\\, Rey and Luke showing a different aspect to the force was good but show in battle scenes.  So we can get a true sense of what these new powers have to offer.  Unfortunately a big disappointment but doesn't stop me Fromm enjoying the franchise. It does slow it down.  Marvel rules the galaxy at this point.","true":true}
