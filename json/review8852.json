Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For once a Star Wars movies makes the Jedi Knights more bad ass and appieling then the Dark Side. I always identified with Han Solo or even Darth Vader but this movies seems to finally achieve it and give the Jedis a glorious outlet. I watched it twice in two very different theaters and the response and joy was both times the same. I sincerely do not understand the bad wrap it got. I think it's a great Star Wars movie. You get a lot for the price of a movie ticket!","true":true}
