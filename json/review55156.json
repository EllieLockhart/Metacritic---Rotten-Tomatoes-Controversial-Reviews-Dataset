Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went in expecting a steak dinner with desert. Instead\\, I received a happy meal with cold fries and a cheaply made toy.\\n\\nI really looked forward to seeing The Last Jedi after waiting for two long years. After watching how JJ Abrams rebooted the franchise with The Force Awakens\\, I was 100% on board with this new series and I could see there was so much potential for character development with Finn\\, Rey\\, Kylo and Po. \\n\\nBut seriously\\, somebody must have forgotten to show Rian Johnson all the previous movies or Rian Johnson must have skipped character arc in film school because these characters got completely destroyed in this movie.\\n\\nThere is no logic to the main plot devices (rebel ships running low on fuel for example). There is strange humor - making the director seem completely tone deaf. It's like a bad dream and I cannot believe I'm here writing to voice my opinions (very sad) about a movie franchise I've loved my whole life. Ultimately it's about expectations NOT matching the reality of the film.","true":true}
