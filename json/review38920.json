Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They pretty much wiped out the entire Star Wars plot not just from Force Awakens but also from the previous 6 movies.  A brilliantly put together piece in regards to the technical\\, the music....but they politicised it and killed the story....a shallow disaster that leaves you nothing to hope or be concerned for in the next movie....no emotional investment with characters or plot.","true":true}
