The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"To sum up this game in one word\\, it would be \\\"real\\\". I judge the game on what it is and my experience playing it rather than being distracted by the way it was marketed (which some people are using to criticise the actual game) and how the audience was deceived through trailers and so on. This game is a very real representation of trauma\\, loss and how to cope with emotions similar to this within an already collapsed society. Having Joel's death be out of no where\\, shocking and unceremonious is considered cheap by some\\, however most people know this is how death is in the real world\\, more often than not. In a world as real as this\\, I was not surprised at the manner that these events unfolded in and the pain you feel from this loss puts you in the head space that Ellie is in. She has no time to be funny and light hearted after this experience and she remains changed forever.  Another criticism this game faces is how \\\"it ruins Ellie\\\" as a character. How can Ellie be expected to remain the sarcastic\\, bubbly 14 year old from the first game after all she has to endure through both games and for the majority of her life? As a more mature young adult\\, Ellie is visibly scarred from the trauma she has faced and understandably so. By the end\\, she is so overcome with the ongoing conflict in her head when she lets Abby live. The real emotion that this game draws out of you is immense\\, and any form of art that can invoke emotions as vividly as The last of us part II does\\, should be considered in my eyes\\, as a masterpiece.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
