Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dreadful.  I was not optimistic going in\\, but I never imagined this train wreck.  The film is a mess.  It's thinly plotted. There is little to no character development. The forced humor is cringe worthy.  The bad guys are the biggest dummies in the universe.  The whole thing makes no sense.  And worst of all\\, it is boring.  I never checked the time in a Star Wars film more than I did during this one.  It was just terribly paced.  I have seen some people claim that the hate for this film is because they tried do something different.  However I find that point flawed.  This is just a bad film.  In fact\\, I applaud the attempt at something different\\, just make it good.  The prequels were different\\, and they were lousy.  I don't understand why they can't make something different and good.  The film has one redeeming moment\\, hence the half star I awarded.  The seen in Snoke's throne room with Rey and Ren is superb. In fact it's one of the best moments of the saga.  Oh what could have been.","true":true}
