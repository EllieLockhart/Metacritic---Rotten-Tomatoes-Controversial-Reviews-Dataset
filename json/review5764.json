Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointed.  All the stars were aligned for a great film but it was another film that contained all the ingredients and traps that led to failure of the last set of Lucas films  - eye candy dictating or in place of acting.  It just whiffed.  It was just plain bad.  Wish it was a bad dream and I could see another version of the film that was better.","true":true}
