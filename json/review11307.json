Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honored the original trilogy while still taking Star Wars in a fresh direction. Humor\\, though sometimes exaggerated\\, never missed the mark or fell flat. Hard to know the actors portraying our heroes will be lost to us\\, but it's wonderful to take a last ride with them before we can't anymore. Loved this movie\\, and it left me excited for the future of the biggest part of my childhood.","true":true}
