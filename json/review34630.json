Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The characters are badly designed and uninteresting. The main issue the saga has now is the inconsistence of the dark side empty from any strong figures and now represented by a definitely not grown up man. The different dialogues were not good either for most of the characters. I don't want to talk about the creatures ( similar to chicken when fried or penguins) introduced to distract people from the main plot but it may be the best part with the new droid cause they do their jobs properly.\\nAnd about the immense change in the direction of the way the force works is troubling\\, before it was the strength and a tool for an aristocracy or a caste completely focused on the battle against the bad side and therefore had rights and ranks superior to the others now everybody can do it without any training and it's stronger and more democratic and there is no explanation at all about this change. How can people be so strong with 2 or 3 lessons? I'm sick with Rey.\\nI'm sick with Rose also. I think she is worse than jarjar binks.","true":true}
