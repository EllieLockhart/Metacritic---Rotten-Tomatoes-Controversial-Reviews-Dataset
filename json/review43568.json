Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was meant to be a sequel to Force Awakens... It WASN'T!\\nIt was meant to set up Episode IX... It DIDN'T!\\n\\nIt completely ignored all the questions from its FAR better predecessor. \\nThen it proceeded to leave the film in a total mess for JJ to clear up.\\nFor a start\\, they killed the wrong Skywalker!
