Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars of the franchise. Lots of sequences should be removed and used to develop the characters instead. Disappointing on every count - the pacing is off\\, comedic scene throw off the ambiance\\, lacking in epic moments with Luke\\, Snoke  (absent). Was waiting for an epic battle that never came. They left us with many questions unanswered wich all and all give me the feeling of a waste movie. Sad\\, just sad.","true":true}
