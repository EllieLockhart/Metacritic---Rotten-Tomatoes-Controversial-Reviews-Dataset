Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film really doesn't live up to the previous movies\\, (yes including the prequels)\\, useless plot arcs and dumb characters. Rey is still amazing at everything\\, finn is useless\\, LUKE is USELESS in this movie. \\n\\nDo not watch.","true":true}
