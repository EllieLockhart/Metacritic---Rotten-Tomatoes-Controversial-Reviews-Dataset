Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Amazing lots of twists and great plot line \\nPlus I hate that people who haven't watched the movie think it is bad because of the loud minority of people who hate it but instead they should look at the quiet majority of people who love it!!!!!!!! ??????????????????????????????????????????????\\nOverall a great film that I have watched it 4 times already and it hasn't lost it's amazingness.????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????","true":true}
