Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Excellent movie\\, it was a breath of fresh air for the series.  The movie had us question the roles and even how the plot line would move forward.  It made some interesting comments about our political climate as well.  And one of the most awesome inspiring scenes ever in a Star Wars film. Something we have been waiting for since 1978.  I think it's the best one yet\\, and I saw all the movies in theaters and was raised into the culture.","true":true}
