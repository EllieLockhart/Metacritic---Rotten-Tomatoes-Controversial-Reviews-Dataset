Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Beautiful cinematography\\, interesting vistas\\, amazing costumes\\, and sound. Some plot holes\\, but I'd say one of the top 3 SW flicks. That's the short of it. Mainly I want to address all the negative reviews that revolve around \\\"WAH! The male heroes are weak! The women are too powerful!\\\": Grow up\\, grow a pair\\, and y'all won't be so triggered! It's time things were a bit more balanced. Geek culture (and cinema) is not only for the \\\"dudes.\\\"","true":true}
