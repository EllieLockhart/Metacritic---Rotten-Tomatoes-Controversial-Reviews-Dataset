Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was good\\, but not so great as the old ones\\, a lot of mistakes\\, and meaningless things. You can see a lot of choreography errors in lightsaber fights\\, and some unexplained events that make no sense. But the Luke's fight scene was perfect i'll admit it.","true":true}
