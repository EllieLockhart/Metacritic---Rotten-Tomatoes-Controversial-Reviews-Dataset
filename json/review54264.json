Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"IGNORE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS!!! They are coming from a very vocal\\, small\\, misogynistic angry group of fans who dislike the new movies\\, dislike a complex\\, conflicted villain with emotions\\, dislike strong women (who\\, by the way\\, do NOT diminish the men by existing)\\, dislike romance\\, and can't accept that the heroine is amazing on her own\\, not because of who her daddy was or wasn't.\\n\\nThis is a wonderful movie\\, deep\\, nuanced\\, emotional and intense. Rian Johnson has created something amazing. The acting was excellent\\, but especially Adam Driver\\, Daisy Ridley\\, John Boyega\\, Kelly Marie Tran and Mark Hamill were amazing.\\n\\nIf all you want is pew-pew and explosions and emotionless\\, one dimensional good and bad guys\\, this probably isn't the movie for you. If you want more\\, if you want poetic cinema and heartbreaking family drama and emerging love (both the sweet\\, fluffy kind and the angsty\\, conflicted\\, complex\\, maybe tragic kind) all against a backdrop of larger than life consequence\\, then go see it.","true":true}
