Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TFA reduced Han Solo to an absentee father\/husband just to play it safe and make him a smuggler again. TLJ reduces enthusiastic\\, idealistic Luke Skywalker to a murderous\\, jaded a-hole. This Disney tripe totally destroys Star Wars canon and ruins everything that made the bond between the characters from the original trilogy so special.\\n\\nAs a male who finds himself aligned with the feminist agenda in many respects\\, the constant \\\"boys against girls\\\" routine in this movie becomes nauseating very quickly.\\n\\nI couldn't be more disappointed with the direction this new series is going in... Honestly\\, though\\, these movies aren't being made anymore by anyone's passion to tell a particular story. It's all a big cash grab at this point.\\n\\nI am hereby done with new Star Wars.","true":true}
