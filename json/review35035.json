Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first ever star wars movie with BALLS! There were a few things I disliked\\, specifically the characterization of Hux compared to Force Awakens\\, and all of Benicio Del Toro's character. Overall though\\, it will keep you gasping throughout in a very good way. Disney\\, ignore the sadfanbois who are upset that Luke is a real human. This is the right movie to make right now!
