Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie ever made. Unimaginative. Terrible plot. Beloved characters from prior movies were completely destroyed in this movie. Disney goofed big time in switching directors mid-series. Absolutely nonsensical decision that will have negative ramifications for Star Wars movies for years to come.","true":true}
