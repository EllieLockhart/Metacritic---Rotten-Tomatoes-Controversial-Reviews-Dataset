Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is being rejected for a reason. Disney can't figure out why the audience isn't giving it raging reviews like their bought and paid for \\\"critics\\\".  In a couple of years when the next Star Wars movie comes out they will wonder why fans like myself aren't going to see their \\\"critically acclaimed\\\" box office dud.  The nihilist script\\, the incompetence of every male character cast as a joke\\, and ruining the most popular character\\, Luke Skywalker did it for me.  Sure it had moments but when you have a line of movies to watch or Blue Ray DVDs to buy I don't see this one standing out unless it is in a buy-five-movies-for-$1 bin.","true":true}
