Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force Awakens was hated for not changing enough\\, and The Last Jedi is hated for changing too much.\\nI understand the hate\\, but it's not well founded. This is a GREAT Star Wars movie that aims to turn the tables and differentiate itself from the early trilogy. This is an example of a necessary change that most people cannot accept. Ask me what Star Wars has the best cinematography\\, I say this one--ask me what Star Wars has the best lightsaber battle\\, my answer is the same. Even the hardcore \\\"love to hate it\\\" fans can't deny that. If it were up to me I would give Rian Johnson the pen and paper\\, and the directors chair for IX.","true":true}
