Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not only is this a bad Star Wars movie\\, this is just at bad movie.  Riddled with plot holes\\, inconsistencies\\, meaningless incoherent decisions and outright hostility toward star wars fans\\, this movie flat out stinks.  Never in my life have I been more excited to see a movie like I was for this one and never in my life have I truly hated a movie like I did this one.  Its hard to even describe how many different ways in which it is truly terrible.","true":true}
