Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi shatters expectations at every turn. Some CGI felt a bit weightless like in the prequels\\, but this ultimately has no effect on the truly subversive story. I questioned some choices halfway through\\, but every one of those choices either pays off or sets up Episode IX in a very interesting way. This film is simultaneously the most Star Wars and the least Star Wars\\, which some see as a fault. I\\, however\\, think it's exactly what Star Wars needs.","true":true}
