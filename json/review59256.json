The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The story was the key factor in this game\\, and with many risky decisions\\, Naughty Dog created a dilemma among players that will hurt the game a lot\\, just like the moral dilemmas in the story.\rThere are many things to say\\, but I just wanted to state one important point. We definitely understand the desire of both characters in the game\\, but is there anyone who can understand why two of them\\, Abby and Ellie\\, gave up from their ultimate goal? I mean we are fulfilling these gaps with some logical explanations\\, but the game must definitely give us more clue about it. Especially\\, in the last scene\\, Joel was the fuel of this revenge and suddenly\\, I mean she lost her two fingers for it\\, Ellie gave up after a scene of Joel's guitar playing. As much as we love the first game thanks to its extraordinary features for character development\\, firstly because of unnecessary risky decisions\\, and secondly\\, because of some important gaps\\, this game will not satisfy the players. Even if you use masterpiece mechanics\\, without a coherent story this game looks like a beautiful soup without salt. One last thing\\, some dilemmas are definitely making players exhausted while there is no need for it. In the first game\\, we were using it in a situation like when we need to save Ellie. Finally\\, in a good story\\, there must be critical points\\, but also there must me relaxing points. Unfortunately\\, this game lost the balance between them.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
