Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily the worst Star Wars movie ever made.  The new characters are terrible and the old characters are treated like crap.  The one good villain is gone.  Now we're left with two idiots running the First Order.  Who cares what happens at this point.","true":true}
