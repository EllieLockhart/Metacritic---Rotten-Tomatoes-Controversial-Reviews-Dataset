Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow\\, the only thing that can save the Star Wars legacy now is if Rey wakes up from a horrible nightmare that was episode VIII at the beginning of the next film. Doesn't Disney have any respect for the Canon of Star Wars? Someone needs to take responsibility for this epic failure and make it right. I get that the new cast is ushering in a new era of Star Wars but don't treat the legacy cast like garbage in the films. Luke was  useless\\, Rey was boring\\, Kylo a cry baby etc. Unbelievable how bad Johnson dropped the ball!!","true":true}
