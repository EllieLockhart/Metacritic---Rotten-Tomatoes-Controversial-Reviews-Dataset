Yes\\, the story is not particularly extensive\\, but neither is it supposed to.  The game grabs you at a certain point by the balls  and it is uncomfortable to continue playing.  This is intentional and brings a (deliberately predictable) twist that not many developers dare.I can imagine that many of the mainstream gamers will not be able to cope with this maybe unusual kind of narrative\\, since this game is marketed as a mainstream game and many may feel cheated.  For me\\, the medium game is well used here because what this game does with you would not work so well with any other medium.  The game should be rated for what it wants to represent and it does it perfectly.  Tetris is also a good game\\, but nobody would rate Tetris bad for its simple graphics.  Unfortunately\\, that's exactly what people with TLOU do.  The game is about hate that gets out of control at some point the more you indulge in it.  Everyone who leaves a hate rating here does exactly what the game describes.  It is a kind of mirror of our all-destructive society.  Constructive criticism is important and always appropriate.  What is done here with TLOU is simply not fair.  Every gamer will benefit from this game because\\, as already mentioned\\, it is the new reference in terms of staging and other developers want to measure themselves against it. Have a nice day.Sorry for my bad english that job did google for me.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
