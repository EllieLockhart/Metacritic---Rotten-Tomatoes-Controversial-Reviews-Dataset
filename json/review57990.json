Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where to begin? I am a huge Star Wars fan\\, probably one of the only people that actually thoroughly enjoy the prequels and I was extremely disappointed with this movie. Like someone else said earlier\\, this is the first SW movie that I will not be returning to the theater to see a second time. As a movie in general\\, the film was very boring with not much going on and even more incredibly unbelievable events. The acting was okay\\, in particular Rey was excellent\\, still not a huge fan of Kylo Ren but better than the 7th installment. The music\\, as usual\\, was amazing (about the only positive quality in the film). I apologize to movie lovers\\, but I hold SW films to a higher standard because of what George created with the original films. Not only do I expect them to be amazing\\, but I expect them to be like GL\u2019s SW films. I have thus far been extremely let down. It felt like a Disney space movie with star wars characters\\, which granted\\, it is. There were Disney elements everywhere that simply don\u2019t belong in Star Wars. The constant joking and \u201cone liners\u201d have ruined both new installments to the saga for me. The ridiculous powers that Rey and Leia have somehow manage with no training or knowledge about is insulting to the original trilogy. Then they are adding elements to \u201cThe Force\u201d that were never made aware of in the original and prequel trilogies\\, you know\\, the ones that have a ton of jedi running around. The spoilers were a major disappointment and then ending left me not excited to see the 9th film. Overall\\, if I was only allowed to watch 1 SW film for the rest of my life and I had to decide between PM and TLJ\\, I would pick PM any day of the week. Disney\\, you better step it up.","true":true}
