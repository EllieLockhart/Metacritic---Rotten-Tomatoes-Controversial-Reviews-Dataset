Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I fell asleep. During a *Star Wars* movie *I* fell asleep.\\nThat's a big statement.\\n\\nHere's what went wrong (I was awake enough to catch the gist)\\n\\nPoor writing ....just awful....I mean where was Rey's training? Why was Luke such a lame duck? Why wouldn't the captain tell Poe what was going on? What was the reason for building up Snoke only to kill him off so non- chalantly? Why did the imperial guards' fight scene seem like it was ripped out of a bad kung fu movie? What the *heck* was up with the casino cutaway? \\n\\nThe galaxy and the world needs heroes. Star Wars isn't meant to be simply entertaining - it's meant to be atmospheric\\, powerful. Disney obviously doesn't grasp that concept or respect the groundwork laid by Abrams in episode VII. Overall\\, I find their lack of vision and my subsequent lack of faith in the franchise disturbing. \\n\\nIn short\\, the only scene I found any comfort in was watching Luke dissipate into the force if only to be saved from the cruel pens that inked this storyline.","true":true}
