UntilThis is a great game for people who enjoy good atmosphere and story narrative.  The decisions you make with character interaction will change the outcome and the kiddy gloves (or the ability to save\/restart choice that removed my favorite toon) which many games offer is not available here in order to force the story progression forward and have you contend with the decisions made.  Until Dawn really takes advantage of the Dual Shock 4 motion sensor to immerse you (the player) even further into the story which caught me off guard the first few times because of how often I forget these controllers are functional Play Station Move devices.  Having grown up when the choose your own adventures series of books ran rampant and still do I suppose...  I am always happy to play a multimedia version of said assembly.  I am enjoying this game as much as I enjoyed Heavy Rain or Beyond Two Souls on the PS3 though the facial expressions miss their mark at times (LA Noire had amazing facial reads). I look forward to playing it through many multiple endings and I hope the Developer Supermassive Games (Start the Party PS3 Move - My Daughter and I lost many hours to this game) continues to bring the gaming immersion.  Maybe release another Start the Party for PS4 :)\u2026 Expand","true":true}
