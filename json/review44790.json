Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Tries too hard to be funny and skips out on diversity between different sentient beings and robots by making sure to have a power rangers ensemble of \\\"diverse\\\" humans take up a majority of the screen time. Didn't seem like a galaxy far away at all. Just a vessel to promote political views (views I support) but in a cheap commercial jacket.","true":true}
