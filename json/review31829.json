Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Special effects were top notch. Mark Hamill did his best to play what was given to him but his character falls flat. The movie is a dud a lame lame sequel and should have never seen the light of day. I lost faith of disney ever making a good star wars again. Roque was alright and was waiting to see what was next. This was just so disappointing it's such a let down .I won't say it ruined my childhood because as far as I'm concerned only episodes 1-6 count as star wars and the clone wars cartoon and maybe rebels. This iust a slow chase scene in space dragged out for 2 hours!!! They could have cut down the chase scene to 10 minutes. There was nothing redeemable about the storyline. Carrie Fisher is gone and her role was such a let down  though I don't blame any of the actors. The failure is solely on kathleen and Rain Johnson who made this turd of a starwars movie. Would rather see the christmas special over this pile of dung.","true":true}
