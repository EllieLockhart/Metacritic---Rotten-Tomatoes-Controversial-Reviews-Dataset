We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game is not about Revenge.\rThis game is about the lack of forgiveness and the cry for blood.\rThis game is about (for the most part) everybody out to do good\\, but convinced of that self image always ending up attacking others and seeking revenge on others.\r\rThere is a deeper layer to this when the creators say \\\"we feel like this story needed to be told\\\".\rThere is a deeper layer to almost every character of some importance or power being a woman.\rThere is a deeper layer to almost non of them doing any better than the men.\rThere is a deeper layer to almost every man dominant in the story being in the flashbacks.\rThere is a deeper layer to Elli pretty much beginning the game with calling someone a \\\"biggot\\\".\rThere is a deeper layer in players\/fans calling this game out for being \\\"made for SJWs\\\".\r\rAmong these layers are the facts that we are all just human\\, just because men are out of power (or in case of this game\\, dead) will not make the world a better place\\, women will light it on fire just as much. And there is also the fact that people will feel trigged\\, will start to look for a fight\\, because at first the woman dominated world with a lesbian protagonist that replaces the man sounds like tagged on to please \\\"SJW\\\" and the Media (Oscar bait in the movie world i suppose). But it's not. You got to look at these deeper layers. It's very well crafted.\r\rThe biggest downside of the game is it's gameplay. It's great\\, it's fun\\, it's well don\\, it looks good... but sometimes you just want to be in the story\\, see what happens next and instead you have to cut through buildings for the next couple of hours. It kinda gets in the way. I can't wait to see what HBO dos with it's adaptation. This could become what \\\"The Walking Dead\\\" should have been.\r\rIt's a great ride\\, try it... and see if you are willing to forgive\\, willing to not jump at the triggers the writers put in this game just for you to bark\\, just for you to go looking for a fight (albeit a less deadly one). This is a masterpiece.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
