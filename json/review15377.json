Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love all the Star Wars movies\\, but this is my favourite so far. The humour was excellent\\, but not overdone. The fight sequences were awesome and the Force and lightsabers were used in ways that I had always been surprised they hadn't been used previously. The ship battle were very epic\\, and the part of the movie with no sound (which I've heard people complain about) was one of the most epic scenes I've seen in a movie (for me anyways\\, your mileage will vary). My main quibbles were with the bolts from one of the ships arcing through space like cannonballs on Earth without explanation\\, or inexplicably losing power over long distances without any explanation (although that one is easier to forgive). Overall\\, I thought it was excellent.","true":true}
