Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked the movie in a way\\, however\\, it had many ridiculous plot holes which were inexcusable. The movie has entertainment value but there were just too many poor decisions made while creating this movie for me to give it a positive review. I don't want to give away too many spoilers\\, but the First Order's chase of the rebels reminded me of O. J. Simpson being chased down by the California police\\, just very absurd. The entire chase was very anticlimactic and boring. Snoke being so easily dismissed and thrown away seemed like a lost opportunity. However\\, I would have to say the biggest disappointment that destroyed this movie for me was the entire character of Luke. They turned him into a shadow of his former self and completely disrespected the entire basis of the original movies. The character deserved much better than how he was portrayed. No wonder why Mark Hamill seemed to dislike this movie and the direction his character was taken. Shame on Disney for allowing this to take place. ","true":true}
