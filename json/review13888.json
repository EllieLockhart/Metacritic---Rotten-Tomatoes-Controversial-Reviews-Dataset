Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you are a Star Wars fan\\, I can guarantee this movie will disappoint you. The jokes are bad\\, it clearly has some kind of political agenda tied in with the plot making it very cringy and annoying to watch\\, and the story overall goes against everything Star Wars. This feels like a comedy movie just with a Star Wars skin and I was very very disappointed in Luke. The only thing that was good in the movie was the visuals which they are stunning but that couldn't save it.","true":true}
