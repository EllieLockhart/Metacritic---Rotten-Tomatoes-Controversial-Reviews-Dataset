Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The first the last of us was about two people recovering each other in a world where everything seems to be hopeless\\, it was about an unsual kind of love: the one about a man and his \u201cdaugher\u201d\\, and not about the overrated love story. It ended with hope\\, the image of a man ready to risk his life and to do the craziest things ever to save the one who  made him understand that there can be cure for past tragedy\\, he actually says \u201cno matter what you keep finding something to fight for\u201d: no matter what may bring you down in your life\\, you\u2019ll always have the opportunity to not give up and and find something for which is worth living.And then what about the second chapter? what does it says to the player? To me it seems to be saying the exact opposite\\, contradicting the same message of the first one( and the dlc): life is nothing but keep suffering\\, it is empty\\, everything (so every happiness) is temporary\\, you end up living alone and with no reason to move on. I mean\\, I don\u2019t know about others\\,  but I used to rewatch tlou 1 to keep feeling that warm ambience and hope\\, and now  guess If i\u2019m going to do the same with the second one... That\u2019s such a pity.Anyway\\, Of course graphics are to\\, but what\u2019s the point of something that has a nice \u201ccontainer\u201d if then the viewers don\u2019t manage to create a true deep (constructive ) connection with protagonists?
