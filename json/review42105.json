Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie really resonates with you. I haven\u2019t stopped thinking about the different scenes and yes there was a lot going on. I think most of the negative reviews are from people who are not seeing the bigger picture here. I will definitely watch it again! And yes it IS fun and a perfect sequel to The Force Awakens.","true":true}
