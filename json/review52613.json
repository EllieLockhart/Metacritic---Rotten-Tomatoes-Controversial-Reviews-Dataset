{"101487":101086,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-02","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All I can say about the last Jedi is unnecessary. \\nMark Hamill did wonderfully with what he was given. \\nCarrie Fisher did as well\\, though she was given even less than Hamill. \\nAdam Driver's performance improved from The Force Awakens\\, but was still not what he is capable of. \\nDaisy Ridley was the same. Together they had the chemistry of the Twilight saga\\, which is forced and stale. \\nSo many scenes were unnecessary. While there were occasional bits of humor\\, it was mostly dry otherwise. \\nIt doesn't capture the feeling nor the emotion of the original six films.","true":true}
