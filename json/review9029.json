Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fuck this movie.\\n\\nTLJ is a festering cancerous abomination created to milk money out of every Star Wars fan while simultaneously wielding a giant fucking SJW card to guard against warranted criticism. Everyone can agree that TLJ is a visual and musical marvel\\, however\\, those accomplishments are powerfully overshadowed by its total failure to the lore\\, it's fans\\, and especially to the late Carrie Fisher. \\n\\nAgain I state\\, fuck this movie.","true":true}
