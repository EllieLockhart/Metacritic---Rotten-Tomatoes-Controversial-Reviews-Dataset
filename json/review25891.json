Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not good\\, not bad\\, just average. Some parts were enjoyable\\, some were forgettable and some of the humour seemed not to be so much forced in as battered in with a sledgehammer.  Will I watch it again\\, of course\\, just not at a cinema as it is the first Star Wars film that really does not need to be seen on the big screen.","true":true}
