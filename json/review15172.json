Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked it\\, new content\\, stands out differently to the other movies\\, which is how George Lucas wanted each film\\, different from one another. I would have preferred a smaller Canto Bight sequence with more of Rey and Kylo instead\\, but we got what we got.","true":true}
