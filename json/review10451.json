Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great popcorn flick. Forget JJ Abrams\\, Disney should just hire Michael Bay to end out the trilogy. If you actually want to see a plot\\, go see the reimagined Battlestar Galactica's (BSG) episode \\\"33\\\". It has the same basic plot of this movie\\, but is much better written. This is basically because \\\"the rebels\\\" forgot their plutonium back in 1985.","true":true}
