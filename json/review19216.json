Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's losing the George Lucas feeling. The entire movie is about escaping the first order and a flat plot about vaniahed the jedi's essence\\, somewhat boring and makes you feel a little bit disappointed. I really hope they can find the string they missed in this movie.","true":true}
