Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a 30 year Star Wars fan\\, this was the worse movie yet. The Star Wars Universe is one that fans and Mr Lucas have worked very hard to establish. it\u2019s really sad that the writers of this film decided to crap all over it. Thank you Disney Company and Rian Johnson for taking something loved by millions and turning it into garbage. It\u2019s clear Mr Johnson that you really don\u2019t care about the fans. ","true":true}
