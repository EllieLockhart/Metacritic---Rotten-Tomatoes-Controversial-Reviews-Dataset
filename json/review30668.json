Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Since there is a two year waiting game between films\\, the imaginations of fans build up the expectation of the next movie\\, to something that ten times the budget wouldn't be able to produce. I say make four hour movies with a 15-20 minute intermission to relieve one's self & get your refills on Soda & Popcorn that your large order allows you to have. To appease Disney\\, charge double for the ticket\\, since you'll only get half the showings in a day.\\n\\nI came with no expectations\\, & was entertained.","true":true}
