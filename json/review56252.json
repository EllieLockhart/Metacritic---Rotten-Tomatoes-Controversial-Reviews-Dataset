Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is movie about the dark versus the light and coming to terms with the decisions one makes. In the movie we see Rey struggling with right and wrong\\, Luke in shambles because of the evil he created\\, and Kylo Ren's complex conflict with the dark side of the force. The movie introduces new and likable characters such as Rose\\, a mechanic who falls in love with Finn\\, and DJ\\, a man who believes that war is merely a game played by the rich.\\n\\nWe see Luke struggle with the idea that he is merely a legend\\, a story\\, and nothing more. Rey has an identity crisis when she sees her hero really is not how she imagined him. Kylo's struggle with the dark side is explored in even more  glorious detail. \\n\\nThis is a Star Wars story like no other. The critical acclaim is well deserved. Long time fans may have trouble coping with the fact that their childhood hero has been given a realistic future\\, but as someone who has watched Star Wars since the age of 2 and read more than 30 something books about the characters. I can say that this story is one that is much better than anything I have seen before. This is no longer a good guys beat bad guys story. This is a gritty story that deals with things that the casual fantasy lover cannot accept\\, and that\\, is why it succeeds","true":true}
