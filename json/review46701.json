Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Weak\\, weak story line. Horrible cutsie animal additions. Extremely lame humour. Cannot for the life of me understand how this film has been responded to so positively by the critics. Short review\\, not worth expending any more energy on.","true":true}
