Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi feels too formulaic to be entertaining - especially as the last two Star Wars installments were so stellar.  This movie attempts to tell too much story but accomplishes the opposite\\, spinning off into meaningless subplots and a painfully obvious required parade of special characters that fill screen time while adding nothing to the actual story.  Meanwhile\\, what could and should have been an intensive exploration of light and dark within the \\\"Force\\\"\\, the evolution of the relationship between Kilo Ren and Rey and their respective mentors\\, is never developed with meaning or depth.  What could have been a long awaited exploration of the franchise's spiritual core is completely wasted\\, and instead we are given a blase space opera washed in meaningless cg action.  Oh\\, and The Last Jedi is awash in \\\"cute\\\" - that sad element of too many Star Wars films - pointless cute creatures and characters tailor made for marketing.  One now must fear that Disney is taking the Star Wars franchise into the Magic Kingdom - the promise of The Force Awakens and Rogue One unfulfilled.","true":true}
