Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie was just made for selling the merchandise and an total fuck you to all passionate star wars fans...  i was almost crying when i saw what they did to my beloved franchise...","true":true}
