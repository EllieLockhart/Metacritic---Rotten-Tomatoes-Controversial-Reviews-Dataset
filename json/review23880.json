Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Major disappointment. Threw my hands in the air several times during the movie just asking myself\\, why?! Why in the world would you write such garbage? The whole movie is completely bloated with nonsense and they treat Luke with such disregard for his character. This is not the Star Wars I grew up with. I\u2019m done Disney\\, thanks for taking a crap on our beloved saga!","true":true}
