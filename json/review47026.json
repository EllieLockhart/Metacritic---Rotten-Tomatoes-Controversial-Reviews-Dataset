Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a disappointment- the longer the movie went on the more upset I was getting from the so called \u201ctwists\u201d that were shocking in a negative let down way as well as the unnecessary; out of place comedy - to the wasted 15 mins of a side mission with Finn. I felt the movie was adding to something that never reached a climax at least not from a fans perspective- I\u2019m very disappointed in this film I left the theater feeling upset and empty. Rouge one was a better movie and I wasn\u2019t even a fan of that one so go figure- luke MASTER Skywalker deserved a better end than that - horrible storytelling and direction J.J. Abrams has a lot of cleaning up to do with the mess left behind by R. Johnson ","true":true}
