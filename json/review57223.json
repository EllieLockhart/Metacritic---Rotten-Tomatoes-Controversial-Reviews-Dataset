Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie currently has a 50% rating\\, and that's exactly what I'd give it. As a single movie with flashing lights and pretty things to look at\\, it's a solid movie. but as a sequel (the 9th movie in the star wars line up) it's total trash. there are so many character\\, plot points\\, and events that make no sense or are outright dropped. so many actors and actresses are wasted\\, characters have arcs ruined\\, and at the end of this movie you realize that nothing really happened. youll walk out with so many questions about the movies choices and plot points and how it doesn't match up with the other films. there are so many massive plot holes that this film shouldn't even be a sequel.\\n\\n Rey is a total Marry Sue\\, Fin was thrown away until he had a solid character arc\\, but the other pointless character Rose ruins Fins arc for no reason\\, Poe is great but is put in timeout for being a pain\\, purple hair lady is cool but she created the whole mess of the movie cuz she's a punk to people (nice words being used there). Luke is not luke\\, and I get the \\\"oh they're crushing your expectations!\\\" argument\\, but no\\, chamging a characters morals for your storys plot is just bad writing.\\nthe theme with these new movies is to introduce things and then kill them. I never feel attached to any characters outside the new main ones because  they all die at some point in the movie lol. \\\"oh they're cool! aw theyre dead now\\\" is half the characters in the film. \\\"oh look that's cool! aw it's blown up. guess we won't see it again\\\"\\n \\nbecause of this movie I am not at all excited for the next one. after seeing so much plot get thrown out for litteraly no reason at all\\, I don't care to see what they stick with for the next film. total let down\\, sucky sequel\\, and just a waste of a lot (time\\, money\\, characters\\, plots\\, personal time and money\\, actors and actresses...)","true":true}
