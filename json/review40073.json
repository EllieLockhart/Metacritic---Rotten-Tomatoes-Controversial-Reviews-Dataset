Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is no Star Wars film. The story is pathetic really. With Characters either not being developed or going against type. It was a very disappointing shock to see such poor film making.","true":true}
