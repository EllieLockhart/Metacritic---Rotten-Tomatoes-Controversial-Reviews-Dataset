Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Total garbage made by person\\, who obviously doesn't understand Star Wars at all. Jokes just don't fit into the film nor franchise. Slap into the face of any Star Wars fan. Characters from original trilogy are trated as a piece of garbage. I fell like the Force Awakens set some direction for the trilogy\\, then Rian Johnson comes to totally destroy that and then in The Rise of Skywalker J.J. has to clean all the mess that Rian has made.","true":true}
