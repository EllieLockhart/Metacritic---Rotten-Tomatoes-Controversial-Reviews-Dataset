Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A real treat to Star Wars fans and to fans of pure entertainment.  Mark Hamill shines as a Luke Skywalker we've never seen before\\, yet is at the same time a dear old friend and a bad-ass Jedi.  NO SPOILERS -- The Force is With This Film!","true":true}
