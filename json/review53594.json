Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Far from a stellar movie\\, and more disappointing as a Star Wars fan\\, but the film has merits that make it entertaining. The script didn't really seem that well thought out. There are plot holes galore that really make the film unbelievable\\, and I realize I'm talking about a film series that's entirely fiction. Was entertained but far from impressed. On a positive note\\, the visuals are great and there are some nice Easter eggs and comedic moments. The good of the film seemed to be designed to distract the audience from the bad. Unfortunately\\, the bad of the film was the story. I'm not sure if I'll watch the 3rd film of this specific trilogy. I'm not sure why critics are giving this a 93% on RT. I suppose if you purely had to rate the film as good or bad it is a good film. I'm surprised more critics aren't calling the film out for its lack of ingenuity.","true":true}
