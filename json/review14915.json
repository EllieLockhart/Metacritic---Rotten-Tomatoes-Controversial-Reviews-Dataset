Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I joined rotten tomato's just to give horrible movie Another bad review. It does look amazing!  I guess you can polish a turd after all! Rian Johnson should work at Burger King","true":true}
