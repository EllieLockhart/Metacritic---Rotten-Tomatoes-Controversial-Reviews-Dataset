Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a lifelong fan\\, and I loved this movie. I don't understand the hate...I have no complaints. Rian Johnson came in with a fresh take on the series\\, but apparently some people just wanted the same ol' same ol'.  I look forward to where the series is going.\\n\\nDon't believe the hate. Everyone out in the real world likes it. Trolls online are trying to bring this great movie down.","true":true}
