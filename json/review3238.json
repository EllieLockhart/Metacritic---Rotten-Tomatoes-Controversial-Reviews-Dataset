Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Beautiful movie\\, but the writing completely ignore all the details of the universe.  Ignores any of the sudo science of the Star Wars world to such a degree\\, it make it hard to suspend disbelief.  It's way too concerned about getting to each major set piece without being concerned if those set pieces make any sense what so ever.  Also the tone is completely off.  Rebels are dying left and right yet everyone is a bit too cheery.  Also too many forced jokes.","true":true}
