Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie consciously destroys the character of Luke Skywalker to pave a way for their new hero Rey\\, who could not be more of a Mary sue even if she tried. Useless sublots that literally made no difference in the movie but to push a political agenda\\, cue entire casino subplot. The worst character in star war history was introduced here\\, Rose\\, and I cant even remember the name of the sleezy guy who betrayed them in the end which again was obvious and pathetic to use a 'twist'. This movie rendered the death of one of the greatest movie characters ever\\, Han Solo\\, by making Kylo Ren's act of killing hi useless as he is still undecided and not a complete villain. pointless agenda push","true":true}
