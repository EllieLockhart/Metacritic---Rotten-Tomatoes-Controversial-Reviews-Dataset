Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute garbage. The Last Jedi fails to follow the source material the from previous films. Instead the producers (Kathleen Kennedy) and director ( \tRian Johnson) make up their own interpretation of SW franchise based on their convenience and agenda. \\n\\nHow did this film ever obtained 90% fresh approval rating? Are the critics so corrupted and money grubbing that they are willing to put their integrity on the line into duping audiences to see this mess?","true":true}
