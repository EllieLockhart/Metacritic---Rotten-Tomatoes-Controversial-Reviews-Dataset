Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Absolute crap story tbh\\,Character\u2019s actions don\u2019t make sense and No I\u2019m not saying this cause Joel diedWhat Joel would have wanted?Lmfao damn you\u2019re dumbEven Ellie herself told Tommy that \u201cIf it was one of us\\,Joel would have been midway through Seattle\u201dJoel would have never forgave Abby for killing ellie\\,Tf you talking aboutThe story is absolute bsA lot of things don\u2019t make sense at allJoel and Tommy trust a whole ass gang and enter their lodge just like that? (keep in mind Joel didn\u2019t trust ellie when they first met lol) a gang that is out near Jackson for absolutely no reason you trust them with your names and where you live\\,Wow Ellie\u2019s story is so similar to top Characters Kratos and John WickAnd guess what?These 2 never stopped till they got revenge.Did they know there were consequences?Yes they didDid they still take the revenge road?Absolutely and they have nothing to regretThe game is about Forgiveness?? LmaoThen why did the character who forgave loses everything while the other who got revenge got away and will probably live happily ever after with lev and the fireflies while Ellie Lost Joel\\,Tommy\\,Jesse\\,Dina & JJ\\,Her finger and the ability to play the guitar which was the only thing left from Joel btw and pretty much herselfYeah exactly poor writing.You know\\,Those 3 characters had their enemy between their hands.Let\u2019s see what each didKratos:Beat the **** out of his \u201cFATHER\u201d till he diedJohn Wick:Shot the dude who Killed his \u201cPUPPY\u201d instantly Ellie:AbBy i\u2019Ll lEt YoU gO ._.This story is so bad lmaoNotice how I said \u201cFather\u201d and \u201cpuppy\u201d?Cause if Kratos was not willing to forgive his father and John couldn\u2019t let go of a Puppy then Ellie surely shouldn\u2019t have let Abby live.And you guys notice how all Males die (Expect Tommy who gets paralyzed) I just found that interesting And the story doesn\u2019t make sense at all when you think about Our mentality (as humans)Pretty sure most of us would kill the hell out of Abby if we were Ellie\\,Cause if someone kills someone close to me and I have him\/her between my mercy\\,I would torture them to death.And that\u2019s why this game sucks.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
