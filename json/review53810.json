Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Half the questions we have from the previous opus are not answered and those that are failed at doing so properly and organically.in the same way half of the main new characters we discovered in TFA  are useless and lack development and consistency while the old ones aside from Karine fisher are poorly used(anakin..:( ).About the plot itself it goes no where and has too many inconsistencies with TFA and we still don't have the background explaining the fight going on between the first order and the republic.It's very disappointing as I was expecting way more.further on It looks like there is no real plan or even main story already established .I was expecting way more...if it wasn't for the direction\\,the world building \\,some of the action and the acting..this would be forgettable. the movie is fairly well made but it is too inconsistent with the star wars mythos and the TFA to be enjoyable and rewarding in any way. I had many problem with The force awaken especially when it comes to the plot but at the very least it was exiting and cohesive about its characters and never boring....star wars the last Jedi however with  few moment put aside.....\\noverall lets say that it is a well made movie but unless star wars for you is a religion no one should criticize you can miss it and watch it at home.I wonder how they are gonna finished this trilogy.","true":true}
