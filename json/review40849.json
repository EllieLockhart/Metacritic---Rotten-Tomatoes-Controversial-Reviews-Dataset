Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie completely ignores the existence of the previous movie and ends all plot lines before they could get off the ground\\, it also has a pointless side story. ALSO IT KILLS OFF THE SERIES' NEW PALPATINE WITHOUT GIVING HIM ANY BACKSTORY AND STILL HAVING A WHOLE OTHER MOVIE TO FILL!!! The only good thing about this movie was the beautiful shots of the island.","true":true}
