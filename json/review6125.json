Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney children's movie written by people who know nothing about star wars\\, have no respect for the force\\, and love lucky cheesy teamwork moments\\, It takes awesome aspects and characters from a wonderful saga and use them in such a shallow\\, hollow\\, and undisciplined manner\\, you would think the writers were given thirty minutes to write the whole film. Please\\, don't let me get into the details","true":true}
