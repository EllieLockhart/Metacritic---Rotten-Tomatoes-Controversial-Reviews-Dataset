Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was quite interesting\\, but it dragged on for too long with extra stories that could've been developed without thirty minutes of wasted time. I was really ready to walk out.(SPOILERS AHEAD)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI also didn't like the fact that all the development of  Ray and Finn's relationship was wasted time as well. I hate that I had the assumption that they were going to be together\\, but to be let down in the end. And that luke died. That was very sad \\n\\n\\nOverall\\, I would've enjoyed it more if it wasn't so damn long","true":true}
