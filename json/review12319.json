Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am so proud of the fans. Who are giving this pathetic attempt at a film a proper score.   70 is what it should be. A 94 from critics is so paid off its a laughable offense. Mad props to those who are standing up and saying. I want a star wars film that does not have death star sized plot holes. An absolute joke.","true":true}
