Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019m blocking out the negative opinions because I thought this movie was amazing. I totally understand there were some plot holes and one or two things were a tiny bit awkward\\, but I got over it all quickly because they will explain most of them somehow\\, I know it. I also sensed a different atmosphere to the movie\\, but I liked it\\, and I liked the humour\\, and I thought the ending was proper. Totally recommend this film. ","true":true}
