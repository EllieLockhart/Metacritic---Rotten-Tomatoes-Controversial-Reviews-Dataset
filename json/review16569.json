Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Incoherent. Existing characters violated who they were fundamentally for the sake of a throwaway plot\\, and the new characters were used in such stilted ways\\, I couldn't have cared less if any of them had died off. Poor direction and script. Please get someone who cares about this franchise to direct it\\, or just stop the bleeding\\, here.","true":true}
