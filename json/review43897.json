Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Though it did have some poor humor and scenes that just didn't feel like they belonged or went anywhere. Overall this is a beautiful and emotional ride of a Star Wars film. A must see. But a must see twice.","true":true}
