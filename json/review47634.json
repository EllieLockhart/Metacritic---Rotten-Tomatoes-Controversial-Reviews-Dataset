Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What was the best thing about episode 5? The giant reveal that Luke and Vader were related\\, making that huge connection that made one of the greatest lines ever spoken in a movie\\, a legendary one. But in this\\, Snoke is nobody\\, Rey is nobody\\, Finn and Rose are the ones we should care about and worry about their backstory more so??!! No lightsaber on lightsaber\\, force ghost lightning\\, goodbye Rian Johnson.","true":true}
