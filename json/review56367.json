Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TERRIBLE!\\n\\nI never thought a Star Wars movie ccould be so bad. Even Episode 1 is 10000000 time better than this 152 minutes waste of time!\\n\\nThis film has such a bad plot that even a primary school student could have written a better one. The situation ist the same as in Episode 5: the rebels(Resistance) try to escape from the empire(First Order). Also this film includes many disturbing and unnecessary characters like Rose or \\\"Purple Hair Lady\\\" (I didn\u00b4t care enough to remember her name). Their decisions made absolutly no sense and made the whole situation even worse! I also have a large problem with Luke\\, not because he changed his character completely\\, but because the film failed in giving comprehensibly reasons for his changes. But the worst aspect of this film ist that it spents nearly 30 minutes in criticize capitalism. Even Star Wars is now infected by the SJW-Virus.\\n\\nI honestly cannot understand why this film has a rating of 90%.The only good thing of this film are the visiual effects.\\n\\nDisney and Rian Johnson actually did someting what I always thought to be impossible-they destroyed the Star Wars franchise!","true":true}
