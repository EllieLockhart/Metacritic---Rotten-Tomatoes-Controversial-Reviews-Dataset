Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful. How did they allow the director whose best film was Looper to write and direct a Start Wars movie? Then you read the reviews and it is like the emperor's New clothes. No one was willing to say how awful it was.","true":true}
