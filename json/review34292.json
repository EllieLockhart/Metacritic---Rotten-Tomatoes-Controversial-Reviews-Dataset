Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The absolute worst movie I have ever seen and I have seen a lot of crap. This is an insult and it breaks up the star wars universe to a degree that it is no longer star wars. They had the last chance to do something great with the old cast but no this is what they did... anyone that says this is a good movie is either blind or only likes it because of the gender politics. People that like this garbage movie are not fans. And nice try using bots to raise the audience score on this movie\\, not only is the movie garbage but the people behind it too.","true":true}
