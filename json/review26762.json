Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Omg this movie sucked a**. Horrible writing\\, horrible plot\\, bad acting\\, stupid jokes\\, and a totally PC agenda. Worse than the prequels. Luke was a whiney bitch and died a pointless death\\, Leia flying through space HAHAHAHAHA\\, etc. The prequels were better than this junk. Shame on you Rian Johnson\\, Kathleen Kennedy\\, and Disney. You should be ashamed of yourselves for this travesty!!!","true":true}
