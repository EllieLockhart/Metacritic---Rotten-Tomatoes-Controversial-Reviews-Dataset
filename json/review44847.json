Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Truly wretched. Script was abysmal and plot logic and character motivations were at the kindergarten level. Poor Laura Dern\\, poor everyone. Several painfully cheap effects on top of it all. No humor\\, no suspense. Contrast the The scenes of the Empire tracking them across light speed with the similar scenes in the Battlestar Galactica reboot to get a sense of how bad it was. Made me pine for Jar Jar Binks. What was JJ Abrams thinking?","true":true}
