Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Far more to dislike than like. I wanted background and completed storylines\\, instead I get grumpy old codger Luke\\, and then Leia flying ( literally!) through space. Rey was weak\\, Poe was obnoxious\\,  and Finn's escapade was a total nonsensical distraction.  I hope the execs at Disney realize that fans\\, not critics\\, will ultimately make these movies celebrated.  Lastly\\,  I've never written a review before and didn't even have an account on here.  But I love Star Wars too much to see it ruined\\, I needed to take action!","true":true}
