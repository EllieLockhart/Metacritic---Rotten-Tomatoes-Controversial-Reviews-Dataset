Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was not completely horrible but you can tell that JJ Abrahams and Ryan Johnson never talked about what will happen in this new trilogy. The result is from a narrativ standpoint: a mess. There were so many buildups in this and the previous movie\\, that just went to nothing. I can personally not understand how this movie has such high ratings even though it was a huge mess and had so many plot holes.","true":true}
