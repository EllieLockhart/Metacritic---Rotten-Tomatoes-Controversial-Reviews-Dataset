Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a huge star wars fans but had watched every single episode before this. And i can confirm that The Last Jedi is utterly rubbish... and a huge disappointment. Like wtf? Leia got blown out of her spaceship and just suddenly fly back inside? She never shown any force abilities beside intuition. Lmao","true":true}
