Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is the most daring Star Wars movie to date. It dares to break the formulaic Star Wars\/Disney trend\\, and sets out to change your expectations of what a Star Wars movie can be. The first act drags at just a few moments\\, but the final hour and half are nothing short of incredible. Some of the greatest scenes in the history of this franchise occur in this movie. The development of Rey\\, Kylo Ren\\, and Luke Skywalker builds some of the most intriguing and likable characters in Star Wars. The fantastic story is complimented by fantastic performances by almost every cast member. Their are plenty of twists and turns to keep audiences guessing and defying their expectations. In the end the movie   tops every Star Wars to this point with the exception of Empire.","true":true}
