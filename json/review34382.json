Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The beginning is horrible. The attempts at humor are just sad...no one ever really laughed. The movie couldn't decide if it was going to be a charming action movie or dark story. The premise is also weak as is the script. Sadly Rian Johnson did not do a good job on this one.The acting is pretty awful too until about midway when the action starts. Although the movie begins to be entertaining at a certain point\\, it is still just a weak storyline...so much cheesiness. I liked it better than the episode 4 ripoff of the \\\"The Force Awakens\\,\\\" but not by much. Even the prequel ones (90s and early 00s) are better than this one. And the originals along with Rogue 1 are still the best.  I don't know why critics are loving this one so much...or why the even loved the \\\"Force Awakens.\\\"","true":true}
