Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My first Review ever\\, this is the complete true\\, that demonstrates that some times\\, the top critics can be bought. solid fan base franchise\\, with a disproportionate review between both groups. The truth is a very\\, very disappointing movie mostly to fans.","true":true}
