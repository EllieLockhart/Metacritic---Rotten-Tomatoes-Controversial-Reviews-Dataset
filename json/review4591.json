Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cohesive story? Nope.   Good dialog? nope Character development?  nearly none.    Pacing\/editing?  Independence day was an Oscar winner by comparison.  The movie neglected to deliver on nearly every item a star wars fan was  looking forward to after the Force Awakens.    The critics who gave this a 91%?  i can only assume they read a plot summary and watched a few trailers.","true":true}
