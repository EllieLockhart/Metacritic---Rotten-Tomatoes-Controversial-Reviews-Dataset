Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horribly writing combined with an overt SJW agenda made this movie absolutely awful. I was a fan of the force awakens and rogue one\\, however this movie was made terribly and it seems like Disney channel writers made the plot. I kept hoping that the movie would get better when watching it\\, but to my disappointment the only good scene was the fight in the throne room.","true":true}
