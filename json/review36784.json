Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie simply doesn't follow established canon\\, I'm not even talking about books or tv shows which are still canon it breaks\/calls into question main parts of the original trilogy and the prequels. It also contradicts TFA so that's really confusing as well. I would give it a 0 out of 5 but then my review might not count in the user score. It's a rumor but I'm not taking any chances.","true":true}
