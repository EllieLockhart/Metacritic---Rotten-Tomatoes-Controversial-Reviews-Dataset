Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Half the story was a red herring\\, all the questions that were raised by Episode VII were through away or ignored all together. I love Star Wars and after seeing this movie I was so sad. The CGI was beautiful\\, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill were wonderful. I also really liked the new character Rose. I guess I'm just really disappointed with what they came up with when Episode VII had set up some really interesting and intriguing story lines that have been thrown away.","true":true}
