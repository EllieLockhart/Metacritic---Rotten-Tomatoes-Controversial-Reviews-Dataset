Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie to date. Horrible plot filled with chaotic passing and boring characters. The The only story line that was interesting was neglected and ultimately ruined. At least Episode 1 had Darth Maul\\, Pod racing\\, and Qui Gon. This movie had almost nothing worthy of remembering. This is coming from a die hard Star Wars fan who has always found something good about every installment. They need to dump this director and get some new writers working on the next one. This was bad.","true":true}
