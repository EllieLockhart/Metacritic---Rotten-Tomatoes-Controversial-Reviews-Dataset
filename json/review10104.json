Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"GREAT MOVIE. Bad Star Wars movie. Luke is an effing wimpy coward\\, Rey people don't care about because of a lazily written backstory\\, Snone and Phasma were COMPLETELY wasted and Finn eas just sorta there. Was severely disappointed but entertained nonetheless. ","true":true}
