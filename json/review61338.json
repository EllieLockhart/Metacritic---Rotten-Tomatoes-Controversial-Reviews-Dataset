We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The gameplay is good but lack a punch and was still the same as TLOU1\\, the scenery is phenomenal and alluring. The only problem is the story\\, it ruined it for me. Even if the gameplay and graphic is good\\, bad story writing can make the game really bland and boring. No one in their right mind wanted bad story\\, especially where they killed of a character we all love for stupidy. The experience the character got in the first game was gone\\, vanish into thin air and all we got is stupid character. They really think it's a good think to play as the killer after they killed one of the favorite character? Talk about stupid writing. All fans want a good story\\, not a bad one\\, if you give bad syory you are ready to get bad reviews. \\\"You can't get the ending you want\\\" yeah? Then why are you complaining when us fans say bad thing about the game\\, if we don't get what we deserve(a good story writing) then this game is as good as dead. The way Ellie leave Abby for something called \\\"revenge is bad\\\" is sooooooo stupid\\, it was used many times now and was so generic. Joel would die nonetheless but the way he died is so disrespectful\\, this a fantasy story\\, you can write anything but the way you write it doesn't seem to satisfy the players but yourself. Shame on your company that created this garbage.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
