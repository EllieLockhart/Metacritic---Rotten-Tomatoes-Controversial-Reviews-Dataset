Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed the new direction of these Star Wars movies are going. I would say this movie moves into my top 3 of Star Wars movies. I've seen it twice amd it was better the second time because you take so much information the first time. People who seem to hate\/critic this movie are the people who cant let go of the old and refuse to move forward. Rian Johnson is going to take us towards a new chapter of Star Wars. JJ Abrams has part IX. Lets see what he will bring back.","true":true}
