Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rain took a several bold moves in the story\\, and while I didn't expect them\\, I was very happy to see a refreshing story and not just another episode V. I've never felt so desperate for the rebels to survive as in this movie\\, it really felt as if they were on the verge of destruction. All this while the kylo-rey story took unexpected twists. Right after the movie I was very unsure what to think and feel\\, but after processing it I realized that Rian has brought us an amazing sequel!","true":true}
