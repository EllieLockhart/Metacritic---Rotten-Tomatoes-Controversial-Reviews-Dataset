Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Filme muito abaixo do esperado\\, piadas fora de hora\\, total desrespeito com alguns elementos que foram mistificados no filme anterior. Kylo Ren j\u00e1 n\u00e3o convencia como vil\u00e3o\\, agora mesmo que ele perdeu meu respeito. N\u00e3o \u00e9 o pior filme da saga\\, mas foi o que mais me decepcionou.","true":false}
