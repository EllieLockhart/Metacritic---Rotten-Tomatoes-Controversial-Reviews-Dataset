Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ryan Johnson is a great director\\, every frame is perfect and looks like a great Star Wars film. The cast is pretty solid and they give amazing performances throughout the whole 2.5 hours of the movie. It is a pleasure to watch and hear. John Williams as always shines with a good soundtrack that underlines the key moments.\\nThe problem with this movie are the jokes that\\, while they can be funny\\, they are very out of place for a sci-fi adventure movie\\, a few here and there are good\\, like in The Force Awakens\\, but here at times it feels more like Despicable Me rather than Star Wars. The little BB-8 is so much overpowered that it appear highly improbable even for a Star Wars movie. Also the many questions asked during the previous episode are not answered\\, brushed aside\\, or even worse they have bad answers that make no sense. How did Rey become immensely skilled with no training? Who are the knights of Ren? Where does Snoke come from? Why did Luke even bother to leave a map behind if he wanted to die? How did Leia use those awesome force powers if she never trained?  Why did Admiral Holdo acted so irresponsibly to provoke a mutiny and suffered no consequences? Many plot decisions while unpredictable are terribly wrong. The First Order officers are completely incompetent in basic space battle strategies and stupid in general. So if you don't care about the plot\\, this a pretty good movie\\, if you love stories that make sense or if you are a Star Wars fan\\, please stay away\\, it will ruin your day.","true":true}
