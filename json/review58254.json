Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A beautiful but horrible movie.  Poor storytelling\\, huge plot holes\\, its lack of continuity and simple common sense undercut the movie from start to finish.  The movie resolves almost all of the mysteries and questions from the TFA in unsatisfying ways\\, usually with mundane and boring results.  What is worse is the treatment of the Luke Skywalker character\\, who SW fans have waited four near 35 years to see on screen again \\, to be relegated to a shell of the character\\, who violates everything fans had come to love about him.  The humor was better suited to a parody of SW\\, it took you out of the film and violated the most important law of SCI FI it made it \\\"cheesy\\\". The movie also undercuts the new trilogy's villains\\, is anyone afraid of Hux\\, the First Order or Ren - no.  They made them into buffoons\\, keystone cops or worse.  Snoke briefly demonstrates he had the potential to be a great villain\\, one that everyone should fear before being discarded like most of the TFA plots and without any satisfying backstory or explanation.  We are left with a angry petulant child REN with daddy issue who proves he is the prequel's Anakin Skywalker's direct decedent. The lack of follow-through on key character moments is in excusable.  Luke finds out Ren killed his best friend Han and we get \\\"nothing\\\" no reaction no character moments\\, - simply criminal.  The plot revolves around a slow motion \\\"chase\\\" that makes no sense and simply breakdown all that we know about the world Lucas created.  The side plot to the B-movie casino was horrible\\, had no impact on the story\\, looked terrible and was overall pointless.   The expectations for this movie was sky high\\, after Disney made a \\\"decent\\\" movie with TFA and a great SW movie with Rogue One (because it respected the source material).  That combined with the real return of one of the most beloved characters in film history Luke Skywalker enabled this movie to have a huge opening.  Now that fans have seen it\\, they are rebelling and calling for the director's and Kathleen Kennedy's firing and the film's removal from canon.   As a business decision\\, how could Disney and LF decide to release a film that completely undercuts not only the TFA\\, but the entire franchise.  The movie is basically a slap in the face to SW fans. Horrible.  What is said is SW wanted this to be great\\, we had hope Disney had righted the ship after the prequels. What we got was insulting.","true":true}
