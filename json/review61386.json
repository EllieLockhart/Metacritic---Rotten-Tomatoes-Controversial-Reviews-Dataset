The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"My brother and I were huge fans of the first game\\, the story and cinematic experience itself was unlike any other game that we had ever played. Never had either of us been so moved by a story before. The game play for the first game is not as smooth or good as part II. That's a given since it's been 7 years since the first game. TLOU Part 2 looks amazing in terms of graphics\\, game play\\, and voice acting. Despite that\\, both of us felt that the second game story wise\\, fell flat on it's face.\r\rThe execution of Joel's death that happens and is in the beginning 2 hours of the game\\, to unwise and uncharacteristic decisions of Tommy and Joel\\, not balancing the game with lighter tones and jokes (like the first game)\\, forcing you to play the game in a way where you wish you could make a different decision\\, makes it impossible to truly enjoy this game.\r\rAfter Joel gets killed\\, it's super difficult to even continue playing this game\\, since he's gone and you end up playing as Abby. In one word\\, I would describe this game as depression. It's hard to empathize with a character (Abby)\\, who you know nothing about and you don't have an entire game to make a connection with her\\, unlike in the first game with Joel and Ellie.\r\rI think if the execution of the story was slightly altered\\, it could've been a phenomenal experience\\, but due to inconsistent writing that doesn't line up with the previous game\\, it's an utter disappointment.\r\rStory wise: 3\/10.\rCharacter development: 5\/10.\r\rHorrible story choices\\, so that's why it stays at a 3\\, since the first game story wise was a masterpiece.\r\rIn the words of my brother\\, \\\"I wish that I didn't waste 80$\\\"\u2026 Expand","true":true}
