Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wasn't a great movie with lots of issues. It didn't follow through from The Force Awakens properly after it set the foundation for a fresh trilogy.\\n\\nWe still do not know who Rey's parents are after the big fuss from TFA\\, Snoke turns out to be easily killed and there were many decisions that could've been changed. \\n\\nFor Example\\, Admiral Ackbar shouldn't have been killed off so cheaply and he should've been the one who did the light speed run not Holdo who means nothing to Star Wars fans. Also\\, Luke should've fought Kylo Ren with a green not blue lightsaber for continuity's sake! There was no reason for him to have the blue one at all.\\n\\nAnd finally\\, there is Rose. The bit when she stops Finn from \\\"saving those who we love\\\" by flying into the cannon only for her to claim that she is doing just that is just senseless.\\n\\nI have to admit that it wasn't until I had come out of the cinema when I realised the issues with The Last Jedi. It certainly took a while for it to sink in given the high hopes I had after seeing Rogue One a year later!","true":true}
