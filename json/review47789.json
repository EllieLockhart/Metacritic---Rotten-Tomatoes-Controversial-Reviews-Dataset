{"101487":196241,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where does one even start with this disappointment of a cluster f**k?\\n\\nLets start on a fundamental film level: So many plot holes as well as so many major points from The Force Awakens completely abandoned. It fails as a sequel\\, much less a Star wars film. So many story points do not make sense and an entire 20 minute chunk of the movie could have been cut without the plot changing at all.\\n\\nOn a star wars level: It is a slap in the face to the loyal fans and a welcoming hug to all your friends that made fun of you for liking Star Wars as a child. It is an abomination. Super leia\\, alien tit sucking\\, murderous\\, coward Luke... I mean for real\\, Luke could face the Emperor and the most fear evil man in the galaxy\\, his father\\, Vader\\, in hopes of saving him\\, but will slaughter his best friend and sister's child in his sleep because he was brat with a little dark i him? Piss off. C3p0 and R2\\, as well Chewbacca are reduced to afterthoughts to please old fans. The entire mythos is altered in disrespectful ways.\\n\\nMy other problem with the Last jedi is the feminist message that is beaten into the ground. Every man in this film is flawed\\, weak\\, and reckless. They even went out of their way to reduce the greatest male hero in Sci Fi history\\, t o a sniveling\\, fearful\\, shell of a coward. Finn is not allowed to save everyone because of some random chick's (ROSE) \\\"love\\\" and teaches him a lesson. Laura Dern has to teach poe a Lesson. Rey\\, a complete Mary Sue\\, teaches Luke a Lesson and so on. We get it\\, men are sh!t and liars. \\n\\nWhat I liked?: Cinematography\\, the Pretorian fight scene\\,  ummmm that is it. \\nWhat I hated: Super Leia\\, Snoke resolution\\, Rose\/Finn story\\, Laura Dern and being stubborn\\, treatment of Luke\\, Ending on the random boy\\, Humor\\, plot holes\\, the \\\"F\\\" you to Force Awakens\\, Phasma death\\, entire Canto Bright saga\\, some crap CGI\\, stupid \\\"chase\\\" about running out of gas\\, an X wing taking out a Dreadnaught by itself and why that is possible... I am sure there is more but I will have to watch again.\\n\\nIn the end this movie is a solid 4.5\/10 for me and I rate it JUST above Attack of the CLones\\, maybe even tied.","true":true}
