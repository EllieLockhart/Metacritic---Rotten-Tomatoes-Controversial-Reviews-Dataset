Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left the theater less than satisfied by this film. It had several moments that seemed to point to what I was hoping to see from this self-proclaimed (or perhaps critic acclaimed) greatest segment of the Star Wars franchise. \\n\\nVisually the effects were pretty decent\\, but the scene inside the \\\"throne room\\\" was very reminiscent of a 1950's low budget film. the red backdrop set a very peculiar look and feel to the scene that in my opinion failed to achieve the desired goal. instead of majestic it came off as cheesy.\\n\\nMark Hamill seemed as though he may have had a great time making the movie and I looked at him in a fresh light from this performance. Carrie Fisher looked tired\\, and I may have been influenced knowing she died not long after her filming her parts.\\n\\nOverall I feel the movie tried to incorporate too many of the old elements of the saga and  was either afraid to stray too far from the tired and true formula or they have run out of ideas. Or perhaps we have just come to expect an impossible level of entertainment that any future installments into the Star Wars universe will be unable to achieve.\\n\\nEither way it was ok\\, especially compared to most of the films out there in theaters currently\\, but nowhere near a great movie.","true":true}
