Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Another rehash of earlier movie.  How the heck do you get sucked into outer space\\, while unconscious\\, and use the force to survive?  Empire still using walkers 3 decades after Hoth? Franchise needs new story line and better writers.  I swear to god if another Death star appears\\, or death star technology\\, I am going to hurl.  Huge logical gaps in plot too.  Does anyone really believe that Finn or however you spell it would know where the top secret advanced tracking system would be on the emperor's flag ship just because he was assigned on a star ship before?  How about the maintenance woman who all of a sudden can pilot an old ski speeder?  Star Wars fans deserve better\\, or better yet end the series.","true":true}
