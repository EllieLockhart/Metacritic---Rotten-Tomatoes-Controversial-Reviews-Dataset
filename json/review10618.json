Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Guess what Rian Johnson? It's probably better to write the script for a sequel AFTER the first movie in the trilogy comes out so you don't end up mischaracterizing everyone. Also\\, try not literally telling the audience every point you're trying to get across in dialogue. You are directing a movie\\, a visual medium. Use that!!","true":true}
