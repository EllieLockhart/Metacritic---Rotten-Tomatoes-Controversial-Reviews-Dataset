Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't believe the hype on either side of the conversation. Is it the worst Star Wars ever made? No! Is it the best Star Wars ever made? Probably not\\, no. But! It is a breathtakingly beautiful addition to the Star Wars saga that took risks and retconned some of the things that bothered me about Star Wars in the post-prequel era. If you didn't like it\\, that's fine. We're all entitled to our opinion but don't let the opinions of some butt hurt Internet try-hards sway you from going to see this. For me\\, I liked it better than TFA and Rogue One but not better than original trilogy.","true":true}
