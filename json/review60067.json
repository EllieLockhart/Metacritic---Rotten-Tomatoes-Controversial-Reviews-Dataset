What a brutal\\, dark and yet somehow BEAUTIFUL story that was.\r\rIt is unbelievable the amount of hate this game has gotten\\, being the MASTERPIECE it is.\rIf you want your run-of-the-mill vengeful hero story\\, look somewhere else. This transcends that...\rThe narrative is built in such a way that tries to make you understand the other side of the events. There is no good\/evil\\, no white\/black\\, just a grey messy circle of vengeance that spirals down into chaos.\r\r***********\rWARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD\r***********\r\rMany people dislike the fact that Joel dies and the way he does. Of course I do\\, too. But if you were expecting a fairytale where everyone lives happily ever after\\, then you didn't even understand the ending of the first game.\r\rI think the main point people who dislike the game are missing is the parallel between Joel and Ellie's story and Abby's story.\rDon't get me wrong\\, I HATED Abby\\, but at least I understand the motives behind her actions. I think the game makes a great job putting things into perspective. She isn't just a mindless evil villain\\, who enjoys killing. She is also a daughter\\, a friend\\, a PERSON.\rImagine she\\, her friends and her father were the protagonists of the first game. Then we would be rooting for them instead.\rIt seems that people missed the similarities between Abby\/Lev and Joel\/Ellie\\, too... but I want to keep this review short\\, so find them yourself ;)\r\rSpeaking of Joel and Ellie\\, I couldn't have asked for a more perfect way to develop their relationship after the ending of the first game. Those flashback-scenes are truly amazingly crafted tear-jerkers: beautiful\\, heartwarming and bittersweet.\r\r************\rEND OF SPOILERS\r************\r\rTo sum things up and make a point\\, you should be open minded when playing this game. Don't expect some clich\u00e9 narrative. Be prepared for some major twists and try to understand them.\rThis game is truly an emotional roller coaster.\rThe long awaited sequel to Naughty Dog's The Last of Us is a MASTERPIECE that lives up to it's name.
