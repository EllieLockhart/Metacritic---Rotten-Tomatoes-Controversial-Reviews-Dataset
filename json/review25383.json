Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"None of the characters do anything worthwhile\\, most of them could've been easily cut from the movie w\/o any impact to the final outcome. An entire sequence (and a few other moments) in the movie feels like it was lifted right out of the prequels. Plot holes so large the death star could glide right through. Maybe this could be recut into a film of half the length that would be alright. Sad day for Star Wars.","true":true}
