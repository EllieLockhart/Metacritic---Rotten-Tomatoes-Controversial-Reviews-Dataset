Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"totally awful \\\"star wars\\\" episode.[SPOILER] Am i to belive that Luke who was going to sacrifice himself just to try to save his father from the dark side\\, would just go and kill Leia's Son ?  totally not believable. Wonderful way to destroy series with UNLIMITED POW... POTENTIAL.","true":true}
