Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars Movie I have ever seen. It is atrocious given the fact that I've been a fan since the 80s. The rebranding Disney is doing is simply unfocused and irrational.","true":true}
