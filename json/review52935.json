Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Another one who created an account specifically for this movie.  The more I think about it I just think that Rian Johnson simply does not understand Luke's character\\, and the whole Jedi thing in general.   It seems like the whole point of this movie was to subvert the expectations created by the first movie.  Dont understand the point of having the search for luke being the main point of the first movie\\, only to have his reveal be fairly pointless.  He teaches rey nothing and basically act like a curmudgeon then sends her home.  Having him attempt to murder his nephew in his sleep was completely out of character.  Throwing his father's lightsaber casually over his shoulder is a metaphor for the entire movie's respect for star wars.","true":true}
