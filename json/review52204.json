Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After watching this hot pile of garbage\\, I could not be less enthusiastic about episode 9.  \\n\\nAnyone who claims they liked this shit fest are wrong and\/or  bots\/ liars or all of the above. \\n\\nThis Star wars film somehow managed to make a Starwars fan less excited about Star Wars.","true":true}
