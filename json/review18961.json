Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its become abundantly clear that the old cast was just used to anoint the new cast and nothing more. Luke's role in the story felt wrong and out of place. It left too much unexplained. I am extremely disappointed with almost every aspect of this film.","true":true}
