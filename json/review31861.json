Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILER ALERT - \\\"Let the past die.  Kill it\\, if you have to. That's the only way to become what you were meant to be.\\\"  Kylo Ren's words here pretty much sum up the one consistent thing about this movie and its entire mission:  Filled with massive plot holes\\, running far too long with entirely pointless side stories\\, Rian Johnson took the creative license he was given and lack of an overarching plan for the series and used it to quite deliberately smash apart and tramp on the mythology and mystery that true fans Star Wars loved and craved.\\n\\nThis episode has cost the series the majority of its most loyal fan base.  We came to see this movie because the past IS important to us.  We wanted to be surprised\\, we wanted to see something fresh\\, new\\, and interesting\\, but not at the cost of ALL the characters and theories we held most dear to the point that any Star Wars mythology has been completely obliterated.\\n\\nThis movie never should have been made.  If you have not paid to go see it yet\\, please vote with your $$$ and wait until you can stream it or watch it on Blu-Ray!","true":true}
