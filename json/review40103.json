Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not a Star Wars movie.  All prior character development is ignored or tossed aside.  The attempt at humor is forced.  The plot development is weak.  I actually believe this movie to be weaker than the prequel trilogy. Those movies at least played by the laws of the Star Wars universe and plot point and attempted to push technology barriers in film.  This movie is just a long rip off.","true":true}
