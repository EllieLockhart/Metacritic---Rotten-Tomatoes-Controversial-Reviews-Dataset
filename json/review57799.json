Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

The 2 hours 35 actually went quickly ...\\nNow I've seen episode 7 and 8 I'm more inclined to want to see the thrawn trilogy made even though there wouldn't be as many surprises as I've read the books. Perhaps we could have an alternate reality trilogy .\\nThere's no comparison to rogue one which ended with my audience clapping.
