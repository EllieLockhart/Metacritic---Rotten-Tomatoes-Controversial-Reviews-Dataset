Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While people wanted Luke to be the untouchable protagonist he was a perfect hero and made a fitting exit. This movie did so much justice not only for the existing characters and storyline\\, but also setting up a new cast or a generation to take over. This was one of my favorites besides the originals.","true":true}
