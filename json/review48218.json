Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Who is Snoke? Who is Rey? Etc. Apparently it doesn't matter. Add to unanswered questions like these the absolute betrayal of the character arc of Luke Skywalker and you have this disaster of a movie.\\n\\nI would give it 1\/2 a star if RT didn't refuse to factor those scores in the the film's total.","true":true}
