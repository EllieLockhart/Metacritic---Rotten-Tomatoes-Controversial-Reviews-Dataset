Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thought this movie was just good the first viewing\\, but the more I thought about it the less I liked it.  But after seeing it a second time I liked it so so so much more\\, this movie is great\\, and if you don't like it the first time\\, I highly recommend giving it one more chance\\, there are things I don't like\\, but the great things about this movie are so great.  It is a different movie for sure\\, but it still feels like Star Wars.","true":true}
