Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As good as Star Wars gets. I've always liked (most) of these movies but never considered myself a fanatic. But I've never been more excited about Star Wars. Gone is any cheesiness or clunky pacing of the original trilogy. Gone is the overuse of underdeveloped CGI from the prequels. This is a space epic full of battles and adventure - but centered around heart\\, and a meaningful meditation about good and evil\\, light and dark\\, and how all of those things revolve around our own relationships with ourselves. Subverting genre tropes while delivering the same extraordinary set pieces and epic moments of heroism\\, The Last Jedi was in all respects excellent.","true":true}
