Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Filled with possibilities\\, but rather abundant in clich\u00e9s. Kylo\\, the bad guy always-bad -guy formula just for the sake of maintaining the good vs. evil plot\\, despite that himself found a beam of hope in his relationship with Rey.\\nAnd also\\, killing the old idols (Han Solo\\, Luke) is not an outrageous idea\\, I mean\\, the actors are already in retirement age. But one thing is to follow the obvious decision and another very different thing is to do it in the laziest way possible. Why did they take the never-surrendering jedi that Luke Skywalker personified and then  transform him into a remorseful figure? Remorse for what? For failing your student? For not understanding that he is bringing balance to the force as you once did? The Luke that we all love and care for would have fought back  the Dark side\\, would have tried to turn his nephew back to the Ashla\\, until his last breath.","true":true}
