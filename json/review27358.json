Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"or the gripping action. It had everything. As someone who was let down by VII (not Rogue one)\\, I was worried they'd take it off the rails. They produced a legendary festival of Star Wars. Towards the end (saw midnight show)\\, the audience was applauding every twist and every turn. Homage. Humour. Plot. Depth. Detail. Awesome","true":true}
