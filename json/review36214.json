Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was the biggest cinematic failure I have ever seen. Shame on Disney for allowing such an insanely pretentious film. After seeing this movie I cannot decide whether I want to see Episode IX in theaters; I know I will never see a Rian Johnson movie in theaters ever again (DON'T LET RIAN JOHNSON MAKE HIS TRILOGY... IT WILL FAIL).","true":true}
