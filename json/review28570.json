Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably the most disappointing movie I have ever seen in my entire life and the way Johnson has handled the criticism is incredibly arrogant and disrespectful to Lucas who lets not forget is the only reason there is this universe that we love and care so deeply about. I just hope they don't let Johnson make a trilogy and divide fans ever further","true":true}
