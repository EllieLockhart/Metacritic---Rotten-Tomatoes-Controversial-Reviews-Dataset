Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is nothing good to be said.  The Last Jedi did not connect in the least to episode 7.  In fact it seemed to purposely dismiss The Force Awakens.  The actors and jokes and new creatures were just hokey.  I found myself laughing when it was supoosed to be serious and cringing when it was supposed to be funny.  We bought tickets early and went as a family to what we anticipated to be a big fun event.  Mid way through\\, my teenage daughter checked her phone to look up the run time as she came to terms with the fact that this movie was a colossal waste of time.  We're all a bit bitter.","true":true}
