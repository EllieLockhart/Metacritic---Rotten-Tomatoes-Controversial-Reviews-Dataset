Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely LOVED this movie. I've been a fan for nearly three decades (so I'm not a true \\\"OG\\\" fan but as much as any 30-ish person could be)\\, and I do understand the bulk of the criticism being leveled against the film. But what I cannot understand is how anyone could even dock it a half a star given Rian Johnson's fresh\\, beautiful take on the galaxy far\\, far away. \\n\\n*SPOILERS AHEAD*\\n\\nLongtime fans (myself included) ragged on TFA because it was \\\"like a remake\\\" of ANH. But TLJ breathes new life into the universe and the mythology\\, and pushes our understanding of the Force forward in a way that has literally never been explored before. While the characters particularly in the prequel trilogy talk a lot about how the Jedi were undone by their hubris and so on\\, TLJ finally lays the foundation for Force users to not fall into those same patterns. Master Yoda was finally able to heed his own advice and \\\"unlearn what he had learned\\,\\\" and pass on the lessons he learned from HIS failures onto Luke. The only people complaining about TLJ \\\"ruining\\\" the franchise need to take that lesson to heart\\, too.","true":true}
