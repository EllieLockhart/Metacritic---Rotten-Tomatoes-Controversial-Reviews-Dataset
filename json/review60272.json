The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I know why many people hate this game. It took me 27 hours to complete\\, which took more than two weeks\\, I gave myself some time to think about what the hell is happening. I think I know why people hate this game.\rLet's be honest\\, everyone liked Joel and stuff\\, but could never understand his decision from the first part. He killed people\\, many people\\, some innocent some not. But most ofI know why many people hate this game. It took me 27 hours to complete\\, which took more than two weeks\\, I gave myself some time to think about what the hell is happening. I think I know why people hate this game.\rLet's be honest\\, everyone liked Joel and stuff\\, but could never understand his decision from the first part. He killed people\\, many people\\, some innocent some not. But most of all\\, he killed the hope that humanity had\\, the hope of getting things back to normal. And many people hated him for that. This part is about revenge\\, where things go ugly and the people who suffer the most are always innocent. Ellie and Abby are so similar yet so different. The game shows you that this revenge path is a circle\\, which will unavoidably lead to more suffering and pain. People who did not like this game just did not try to understand it. I see so many reviews about how they will not complete the game\\, how they are not willing to sympathise with Abby and listen to her part of the story. This game is not about LGBT\\, muscular woman\\, pregnant woman or transgenders. If you just try to listen to whatever this game is trying to teach you\\, wait for a bit and carry on playing till the very end\\, you will see that the details of the lgbt and all of that does not matter. Lev and Yara are amazing characters no matter what.\rDo not ruin your game experience with limiting your emotion spectrum to the level of a tea bag. Listen first to what game is trying to teach you and then write your review.\rThe reason why I liked this game is very simple yet it took me to realise that. This game is deep. It tells you so much yet leaves the analytical part to yourself. This is why many people thought that the game is wrong. They just never gave it a second thought. And this game needs more than just one extra thought. I read many comments and saw enough reviews to understand that many people just treated it as a game\\, not the story that you analyse and understand\\, just another game. I see that many people did not understand what the first part was all about and they carried this misunderstandings to the second part and therefore understood nothing and ended up hating the game and ruining one of the best playing experiences you can ever have just playing a game.\rIf you are ready to listen\\, to learn about what the game is trying to tell you\\, if you have patience to learn then you should definitely give this game a go. I would recommend it to anyone\\, except for kids\\, this game has way to many violence and is too deep for kids to play\\, they will not understand **** about this game and end up writing a negative review.\rDo not play this game if you are dumb as **** and have no sympathy towards others or hate anything that has to do with transgenders or gay people. But i think this limitations can be applied to any game\\, so just go to school and do your homework bro\u2026 Expand","true":true}
