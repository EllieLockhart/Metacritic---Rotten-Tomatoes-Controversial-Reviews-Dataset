Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi is an extremely balanced movie which could have gone off well only on Nostalgia pay offs\\, great cgi and amazing light saber battles but it went further than that to give deeper meaning to the franchise and to question what we expect from a star wars movie. Amazing movie!","true":true}
