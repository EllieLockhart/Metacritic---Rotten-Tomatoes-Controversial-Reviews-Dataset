Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great sci-fi action and independent storytelling\\, but completely dismisses where these characters come from and their roles in the franchise. This is a turning point for the franchise to become an annual action attraction similar to the marvel universe.","true":true}
