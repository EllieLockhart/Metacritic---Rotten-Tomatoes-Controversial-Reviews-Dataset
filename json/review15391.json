Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved every Star Wars film until now.\\nHumor made light of the villains and they were no longer threatening.\\nNo characters were explored from their introduction in the previous film.\\nI was hoping to see Rey get trained\\, but she wasn't and even beat down Luke which made no since.\\nFlying Leia.\\nPhasma had 5 minutes or less then dies.\\nLuke is a hermit bafoon.\\nHoldo was elegant and smart\\, then she dies.\\nHuge plot issues. Waisted time in a casino while their ship is being chased and they decide to free animals into the woods when they'll obviously get recaptured. After the cliff hanger in the last move while Rey hands Luke his old saber\\, then in this film he chucks it over his shoulder for humor. It's like Rian Johnson (the director) wanted to crap on all serious moments and turn it into Space Balls 2.\\nLuke Dies in a very pathetic way. Waste of time and money.","true":true}
