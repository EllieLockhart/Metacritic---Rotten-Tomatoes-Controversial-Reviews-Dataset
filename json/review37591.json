Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is no good addition or respect to the lore\\, half of the plot of the movie is a complete waste of time and the new characters do not develop further. Would not see again or recommend.\\n\\nP.S: Did you know that to destroy live on earth you only need 150g moving at light speed? that's a freaking baseball! Imagine a collision with the mass of a f***ing ship!","true":true}
