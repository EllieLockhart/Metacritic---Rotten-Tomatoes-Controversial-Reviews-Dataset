Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm totally unsure of why this is getting hit so hard by audiences. I can only assume that everyone who's gone negative went into it with too many pre conceived notions about what they thought it was going to be. For me\\, I thoroughly enjoyed all of it. Maybe I'm not a purist\\, who knows... but it was well worth my hard earned dollar.","true":true}
