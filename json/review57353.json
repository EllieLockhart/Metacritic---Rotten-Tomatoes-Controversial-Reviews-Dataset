Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie killed all that TFA built. Good action movie\\, horrible Star Wars Movie. Rogue One crushed this. I thought is started a little too slow(felt they could have trimmed 20 some minutes) and I didn't like how they didn't answer questions I wanted from the force awakens\\,  wanted  more  snoek plasma\\,  Knights of Ren  and Reys parents\\,  I felt like when the movie left Luke Leah Rey and kylo it always went off on a tangent that kind of slowed it down\\, did not like Flynn Rose story or Luke dying.... I thought the space fighting scenes were awesome as well as anything related to the force\\, nice to see puppet yoda again\\,  Over all it was good I just wish JJ Abrams had directed it you could tell the other director made it into more of a Marvel Comics movie than a Star Wars movie...but at least he is coming back for #9\\,  Think the one you and I saw Force Awakens was the best of new ones...Oh and how they wasted the Princess's character and force powers\\, why was Flynn in this movie again??","true":true}
