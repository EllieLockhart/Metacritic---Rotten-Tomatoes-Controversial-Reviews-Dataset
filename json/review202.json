I can't remember the last time I was laughing my ass off this much with a video game. The gameplay is superb as well since you have six different fighting styles to choose from which gives you variation.\r\rI just finished the main story in 40+ hours while doing substories here and there that crossed my path and I was only on 26% completion. If that doesn't give you your bang for your buck than I don't know what will.\r\rAll I can say now is that they got a new fan in me and I can't wait for Yakuza Kiwami\\, which comes out in August 2017. DAY ONE PURCHASE FOR SURE!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
