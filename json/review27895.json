Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pior coisa que eu j\u00e1 assisti na vida. Cad\u00ea o desenvolvimento dos outros personagens? Nem todo mundo se importa com Kylo Ren. Finn merecia ter sua est\u00f3ria desenvolvida\\, assim como o Poe e a Rey. N\u00e3o seriam eles o novo trio? Onde que conta isso?","true":false}
