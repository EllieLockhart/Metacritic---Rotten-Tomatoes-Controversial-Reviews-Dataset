Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think ths problem is\\, is that Rian Johnson didn't go anywhere near what all the now-disappointed fanboys were predicting. I read one fan review that said they saw it opening night at an IMAX and no one laughed at anything.  I had the opposite experience - we saw it on Thursday and the theater was filled mostly with folks who were around for the original trilogy's original relases and we were all having a blast in the GFFA\\, laughing\\, cheering\\, applauding.  Fantastic night.","true":true}
