Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the best Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back. It takes a mature turn like the way that The Empire Strikes Back did a long time ago. On top of the exciting adventure story\\, there are surprising twists\\, explosive battle scenes\\, moments of mystical wonder\\, and some satisfying emotional stories. Rian Johnson's writing and directing achieve a level of complexity and depth that has been missing from the Star Wars movies for many years\\, and yet there is also humor and irony. Daisy Ridley and Adam driver turn puzzling questions about the nature of good and evil into unexpected revelations. Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill shine in their legendary parts. The best part is the suggestion that The Force can be with anyone.","true":true}
