Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was great. Was there a dumb scene with Leia? Yes. It doesn't ruin the movie or the franchise\\, though. All you haters come off like a pack of mouth-breathers with no interest in actual\\, good storytelling or cinema. Walking out of the theater\\, I overheard two fanboys complaining that all they wanted from the movie was \\\"no space battles\\, and a badass lightsaber fight\\, and it failed on both.\\\" And I'm shaking my damn head.","true":true}
