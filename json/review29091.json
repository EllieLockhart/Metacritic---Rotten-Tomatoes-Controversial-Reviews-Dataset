Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really not one of the best of the series.  For \\\"Star Wars\\\" fans numerous things about the plot\\, etc. are quite disappointing.  If you're going to make a movie and ignore the established tenets of the brand\\, then just make it a different movie. Heck even Mark Hamill came out and said he didn't understand his own character in this movie.  The fans that love the Star Wars brand are the ones you should be trying hardest to keep happy.  You can make any good space movie\\, but if you break the fan following you just end up with a dying brand.","true":true}
