The last of us part 2 is VERY beautiful game\\, but that simply doesn\u2019t matter when you put ZERO effort into the story. (Slight spoilers ahead)The writing is terrible\\, my three year old cousin could probably come up with a better story. That random sex scene on the boat was so unnecessary\\, out of place and lazy. It\u2019s so obvious you wanted to go for this \u201cShock factor\u201d but it just falls on its face and ends up being this forced cringe attempt of having this super unpredictable story. The way that Joel\u2019s story ended was an insult to anyone who put their time into the first game and yet again another failed attempt to get the player to feel something. You had the best source material ever when you started to develop a sequel and this is what you came up with?\u2026 Expand","true":true}
