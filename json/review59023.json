Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Had to write my first review on metacritic just for this one because there seems to be a war on truth these days.

Having just beaten it\\, 30-40 hours later\\, exhausted and extremely pensive\\, one of my biggest takeaways was that this has to be one of the most ambitious video games ever made. Even if you dont like the story\\, the graphics are stellar\\, so are the animations\\, voice-work\\, sound design\\, production design\\, cinematography\\, level design\\, set pieces and especially the moment to moment gameplay. The story wont gel with everyone on the other hand. Its well written but not as tightly scripted as the first game. Its told through different characters and the narrative sometimes jumps back and forth in time to set up said characters. As a fan however you should always strive to give the thing your supposed to love\\, the benefit of the doubt. Some people\\, and so called \u00abfans\u00bb\\, havent even played it\\, they are just reacting to rumors\\, or worse yet reacting to the reactions someone else had when playing this game. Its a storybased single player game\\, immersion\\, agency and player input have always been paramount. And if you want to stand at a distanse and poke holes at it you may do so.  But you do so in a very disingenious manner. Just like a Nolan movie\\, if you \\\"go with it\\\" and allow yourself to be immersed you will find the end result to be extremely emotionally rewarding\\, in spite of the odd cringy line or the rare logical lapse. As a fan I gave it the benefit of the doubt because its the sequel to one of my favourite games of all time And when the story went somewhere unexpected i thought to myself\\, \\\"this must be for a reason.\\\" Turns out its true. And at the end i was exhausted\\, contemplative and full of emotions. Kind of the hallmark of good storytelling. Kind of what the first game did.\r\rTo those who are on the fence\\, give it the benefit of the doubt. I think you will come away impressed by its sheer scope\\, its gameplay and its extreme ambition. I for one cant believe what they have achieved here and im so happy that i got to experience it. And for those out there making spam accounts (i see you there reddit)\\, not having played it\\, not giving it a chance\\, doing it out of some spiteful\\, capriceous or political motivation - you will most likely never make something this good. Food for thought.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
