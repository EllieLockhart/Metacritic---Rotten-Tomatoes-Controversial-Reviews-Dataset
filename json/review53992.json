Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am sorry about this movie\\, making Luke's character for this. This all with the student Kylo\\, and actually everything\\, it doesn't come through to me. I waited so long to see Luke again\\, and what I got... this teleporting nonsense. There is a martial art wisdom\\, a shaolin qoute\\, B.Lee says it in one of his movie: \\\"A martial artist has to take responsibility for himself and accept the consequences of his own doing.\\\" I could write tons of words why I hate that movie. At least we have the Expanded Universe\\, where Luke is really a great force-user. The prequels had some weekness\\, yes\\, but I never felt disappointment\\, only by this Last Jedi nonsense. I hope in the next 2 years Disney is making the lessons needed to understand. Rouge One was great\\, tuching the Force through Donnie's character\\, but this now was the deep water\\, and Disney failed\\, to me\\, in that.","true":true}
