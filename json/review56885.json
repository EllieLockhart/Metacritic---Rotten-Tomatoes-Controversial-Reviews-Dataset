Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There was no story and the philosophy around the force and the Jedis was completely missing.  It was all about action and it was just one big battle scene. \\n\\nIt was completely missing what I liked about Star Wars movies\\, even the prequels\\, which is a story and a purpose for the main characters.  This one did not really make a lot of sense - it was just one battle scene after another.\\n\\nThe critics rated it well because they had to.  They all have to sell out at times like these - do you want to be the one that stands up to one of the biggest entertainment companies in the world that just invested millions in a product??  Disney is not quite on the dark side with this but I don't think the force is with this latest installment of the franchise.... :(","true":true}
