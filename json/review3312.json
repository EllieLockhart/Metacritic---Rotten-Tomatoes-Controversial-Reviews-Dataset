Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Before I start this review I want to state that it has nothing to do with the \u201cagenda\u201d or anyone\u2019s race or gender\\, I think it\u2019s wonderful and appropriate that different kinds of people are getting represented. I\u2019m just talking about the story. I know Star Wars is a fictional world and all that\\, but even within its confines this movie makes little to no sense. Everything that happens is ridiculous and farfetched and not grounded at all. Star Wars has always had an issue with plot holes and story telling\\, but this is a new low. But as always it is visually beautiful. I really enjoyed rogue one and I thought the force awakens was decent so this was kind of a surprise. ","true":true}
