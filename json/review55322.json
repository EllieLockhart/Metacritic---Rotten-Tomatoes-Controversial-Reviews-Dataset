Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Likes\\nI liked how the film was shot \\nThe CGI was beautiful\\n\\nDislike\\nThe development of the story \\nThe development of the characters \\nLuke Skywalker being ruined\\nThe script itself was poor \\nThe Humor \\n\\nGood and the bad \\nThe surprise's where surprises couldn't of guessed what would happen however the surprises where let downs and real disappointments. \\n\\nOverall it's my least favourite Star wars movie as of yet\\, but leaves me with high hopes that it can be salvaged.","true":true}
