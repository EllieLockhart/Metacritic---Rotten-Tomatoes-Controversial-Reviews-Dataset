Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson and JJ Abrams should be tarred and feathered and run out of town on a rail... these bas#%rds are complicit in the destruction of the most cherished story saga in cinematic history. How many books exist in the Star Wars canon set after the events of Return of the Jedi? These guys ignored all of them. Totally threw them out in the trash. Instead\\, they created a completely new Star Wars universe replete with slick visual effects\\, a couple twists\\, AND ABSOLUTELY NO PLOT. These guys wouldn't know story structure if it kicked them in the face. They excel at creating characters that we don't care about. They excel at moronic\\, pithy dialogue. Nope\\, all the \\\"action\\\" sequences and fiery explosions can't hide the glaring structural flaws. Horrendous writing\\, helmed by bas#%rds intent on rewriting the entire canon\\, totally out of touch with the Star Wars universe. Zero stars. Go watch literally anything else.","true":true}
