Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SW The Last Jedi is an excellent film. It falters in some aspects (i.e. casino scenes) but it is able to move the Star Wars story forward in new and exciting ways that break with the old (a recurring theme throughout the movie) in mostly consistent and convincing ways.","true":true}
