Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this was a great Star Wars flick. It had some weak moments but also some really strong\\, great scenes that paid off. I enjoyed the movie as did my family. What else can you say about a film?","true":true}
