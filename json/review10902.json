Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hated this movie\\, hated what they did to Luke Skywalker.  He went from hero to zero.  Went from wanting to be a Jedi like his father to saying the Jedi should end.  What idiot thought that was a good idea.  What happened to the optimism and comradery that made the originals.  Expected a lot more from Disney.","true":true}
