Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was so bad\\, they made the guy with the ugliest face take off his shirt to show his firm\\, hard\\, beautiful chest. That was worth slipping $5 in his g-string.  However\\, I could've saved the rest of the money and went to a Woman Studies class and got man-bashed for free. White people bad\\, evil.  Everyone else\\, good\\, smart. Yeah. I got it.  The plot?  There was a plot?  Seriously?  No. The story starts off in an alternate Universe\\, nowhere close to the ending of the last one\\, and ends up\\, nowhere close to anything I want to see next.","true":true}
