Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am 48 year old women and fan of Star Wars since the first. The Last Jedi as well as the Force Awakens seem determined to destroy my childhood and crap all over everything I held dear about Star Wars. Don't mind the diverse cast\\, Star Wars has always been inclusive. I mind the lack of coherent story. I mind the repetitive stealing of old ideas. I mind the killing of old characters because it provides a lazy poignant moment and is easier than moving their story forward. I mind the lack of believable bad guy\\, instead of the personification of terror of the Empire\\, we have some emo\\, teenage angst boy. You are nothing without the older fans\\, there would be no franchise to revive without us\\, why treat us this way? Do better.","true":true}
