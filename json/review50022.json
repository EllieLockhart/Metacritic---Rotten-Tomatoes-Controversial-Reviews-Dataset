Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Zero character development.  No interesting new planets\/creatures except for the porgs which are only there to sell stuffed animals.  The casino planet served as nothing more than a way to dump on war and capitalism.  New characters (Rose and Holdo) are less interesting than cardboard.  Phasma and Snoke die without any fanfare.  Rey is suddenly a Mary Sue and Luke wants to burn old Jedi books\\, but instead Yoda does it for him.  Kylo ren sulks and Poe and Finn are useless.  The battle at Crait was Hoth 2.0 nothing new to see here.","true":true}
