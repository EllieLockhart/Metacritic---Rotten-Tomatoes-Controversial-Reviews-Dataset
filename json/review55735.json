Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Open letter to J.J. Abrams\\n\\nI don't know whether Disney will give you the possibility to remake episode 8. It may be too difficult for them to admit Rian Johnson's and Kathleen Kennedy's failure.\\nIf they don't let you do it\\, please produce a 4 hours movie containing your remake of Episode 8 and your Episode 9.\\nThere is NO WAY you could do something good with the mess left by Johnson. He blatantly gave you his middlefinger by completely ignoring EVERYTHING you had set up in Episode 7. He deserves no respect from you.\\n\\nLots of actual fans\\, the vast majority I would say\\, will not buy tickets to watch your Episode 9 if it starts where Episode 8 finished.\\nSo\\, please\\, act like Johnson's Episode 8 was only a Star Wars Legends episode happening in a parallel timeline\\, disconnected with the rest of the canonical episodes of the Saga.\\n\\nPlease\\, J. J.\\, there must be a public announcement that this will indeed be your job: to completely rule out of canon this abortion of a movie and to start where you left with Episode 7.\\n\\nI personally think\\, and I hope to see it stated in the comments inserted by others after mine\\, that we\\, the real Star Wars fans\\, will come and watch your Episode 9 in the theatres only if it completely overwrites Episode 8.","true":true}
