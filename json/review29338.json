Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson betrays the Star Wars franchise and it's beloved characters\\, making a film that is far more a Rian Johnson film\\, and less one that belongs in the saga.\\nQuestions raised in The Force Awakens are either ignored or answered in such backhanded ways that it feels as though Rian is slapping us for expecting a good answer\\, worsening the previous film in the process.\\nThis is a movie of missed opportunities and a complete lack of reverence for what came before.","true":true}
