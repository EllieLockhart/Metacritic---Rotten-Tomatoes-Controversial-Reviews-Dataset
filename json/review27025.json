Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best Star Wars movies with some controversial passages.\\n\\nDue to the fact that I am a 90s kid\\, I did not watch the OT in cinema and therefore maybe never felt what the kids in the 70s felt.\\n\\nThe movie has some weird scenes and at times there are way too much jokes. Despite of that\\, I felt more Star Wars than I felt watching Episode I\\, II\\, VI and VII.\\n\\nMy fear that \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" would be a \\\"Empire Strikes Back\\\" 2.0. was ungrounded.\\n\\nFor me \\\"Tha Last Jedi\\\" is currently the best Episode-movie (without Rogue One) Star Wars movie alongside \\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\". :)","true":true}
