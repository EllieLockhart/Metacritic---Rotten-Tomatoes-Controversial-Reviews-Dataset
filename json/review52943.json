Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An uninspired film that desperately tries to link bits of the film with the first trilogy only to please some fans but failing miserably in the process. Within 15 minutes there are plenty of jokes a la Marvel that leaves the viewer wondering if it's something directed by a drunk Mel Brooks. Best of the film comes with Hamill and Fisher which let us wonder why the Skywalker\/Solo family weren't on the forefront of the film from the start of this new trilogy. The old new characters are weak\\, though I thought Rey (Daisy Ridley) was good in Ep 7\\, there is nothing special about her on this film. A very 2D character that won't even change expression through out the film. Finn (John Boyega) was the best out of the new characters\\, this guy is a very charismatic actor and can deliver (silly) jokes. Poe? Yeah\\, whatever. And Kylo Ren? What about Kylo Ren? He cries and rant like toddler. Not much to say about him. In the end is a mediocre film\\, some good bits and plenty of Disney extravaganza. A wasted opportunity that we all knew would happen.","true":true}
