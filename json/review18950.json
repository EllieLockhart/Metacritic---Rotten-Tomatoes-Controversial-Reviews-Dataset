Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It says Star Wars on the can but it don't taste like Star Wars.\\n\\nGood questions were raised in The Force Awakens\\, and The Last Jedi failed to answer them at every turn. This movie had so much potential but I'm left feeling utterly disappointed. It's clear that Disney doesn't understand Star Wars\\, they don't know what to do with it and there is little direction. This movie was just made for the merchandise. If you're knowledgeable about Star Wars canon\\, the history of the Jedi and the force I think you'll be perplexed by this movie. If you like cute things and you're a Social Justice Warrior you'll probably love this movie. For me Star Wars ended at Ep. VI. Disney screwed this up and I wouldn't be surprised if Star Wars hype dies in the next few years.","true":true}
