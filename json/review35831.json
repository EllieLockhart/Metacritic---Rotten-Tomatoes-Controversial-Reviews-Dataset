Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is one of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen. The entire 2nd act of the movie is just horrible\\, The new character Rose takes center stage and that is plain stupid because she ruins everything in the end as well. Some nice action sequences with Oscar Issacs Character but that's mostly it because Rey is on an island the entire movie with a old Luke Skywalker who was writin as a joke. After all Star Wars the Last Jedi is not a good movie in any way and is and embarrassment to all Star Wars Movies.","true":true}
