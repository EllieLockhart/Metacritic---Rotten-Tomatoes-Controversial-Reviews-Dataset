Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had probably too high expectations after Rogue One. \\n\\nAppart from massive plot hole or deus ex machina every 10 minutes or so\\, I am really missing a strong protagonist. Someone who appears to know what she is doing and does not rely exclusively on longshots and miracles. \\n\\nOnly Benicio Del Toro's character satisfied these conditions in this movie. Everyone else sucks at their jobs. Badly.","true":true}
