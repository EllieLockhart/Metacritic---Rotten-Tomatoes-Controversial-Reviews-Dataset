Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw this on the 14th and was not disappointed! It offers new and interesting ideas as well as major shocks and twists that I for one did not see coming. Action from beginning to end\\, and the battle sequences that are enough to thrill anyone old or new to the series\\, I guarantee you'll enjoy it albiet with very minor flaws here and there but not enough to keep me from watching it a second time! You'll love it!...unless you're an overly obsessed fanboy who still lives in 1977 and hates Disney and \\\"diversity\\\" in their Star Wars films.","true":true}
