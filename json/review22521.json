{"101487":149730,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-23","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let me start by stating for the record that it's been four days since I watched the movie. I found it pretty mediocre. Honestly I wasn't expecting anything spectacular so I had my disappointment in check\\, although it was sad  exiting the theatre after a Star Wars movie feeling I had just wasted the last 150 minutes of my life.\\nStill\\, I had watched many bad movies in my life and I never felt the urge to go the web to let  people know how I felt about it\\, I think the world can live without it.\\nWhat brought me here and made me sign up to write my first (and possible last) review\\, was the arrogance with which the critical voices of thousands of fans have been dismissed as irrelevant by so call professional critics (who probably receives a Xmas basket from Disney every year). I read any sort of nonsense and cospiracy theory trying to explain the unthinkable: many people didn't like the movie.  Let me tell you that obscure political reasons has little to do eith that\\, simply \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" is a bad one. Not a single memorable character\\, not a single memorable scene (I mean not a good memorable one\\, I'm not going to forget Leia Poppins easily) in a movie made unnecessarily long by subplots which served no purpose. \\nI have nothing against a bit og humour in a Star Wars Movie\\, but in this one they felt out of place nine times out of ten. \\nLuke had to die\\, we all knew that\\, it's the old master fate. Qui-Gon died\\, Obi Wan died\\, Yoda died. The man with the white beard had to die so the young pupil has to take on the villains alone. It's a cliche\\, but it's understandable from a storytelling point of view. The annoying part was what we witnessed for most of the time Luke was alive. As Mark Hamill said\\, that wasn't Luke Skywalker. Yeah\\, it's been thirty years and people can change\\, but that doesn't make any random change as believable as the next. This Luke had nothing of the character we met in the original trilogy.\\nThe rest of the good guys team is pretty forgettable. Rey has potential but little depth. Finn\\, Rose and Poe are trapped in a pointles storyline which goes nowhere. Leia can live (and indeed fly) in open space (just like Frieza from Dragonball) but has seen better days. And don't get me started on Vice Admiral Hold.\\nHow about the villains? Snoke  was a very enigmatic figure who seemed to have many secrets to reveal\\, but\\, guess what\\, before any of the misteries  sourrounding him is the explained he's dead\\, just like that.  The scene leading to his death is a ramake of ROTJ finale\\, where Vader cannot handle the sight of the Emperor abusing Luke and kills him by taking him by surprise. Only this time this decision changes nothing\\, five minutes later Kylo Ren makes clear he's determined to do exacatly what Snoke would had asked him to do: destroy the rebellion and Luke Skywalker. Before that he offers Rey to rule the galaxy together and she tells him not to take that path. Rings any bell? Copy-pasting is so simple.\\nSo Kylo Ren is the new supreme leader. Kylo Ren\\, master of the knights of Ren. By the way what are they? Nobody knows\\, they are not even mentioned anymore. As for Kylo and his counterpart\\, Armitage Hux\\, they are a comedy duo. They are as intimidating as Abbott and Costello would be. \\nLast mention for Master Yoda and his line about failure \\\"the greatest teacher\\\" according to him (courious sentence by the way from someone who once said \\\"Do\\, or not do\\, there is no try\\\"). Failure is certainly strong with this movie.\\nLet me finish by saying that\\, in spite of all above\\, \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" ranks beyond doubt in the top ten of the Star Wars movie of the last 20 years\\, possibly of the last 40. I bet someone involved with this prodution would take it as a genuine compliment.","true":true}
