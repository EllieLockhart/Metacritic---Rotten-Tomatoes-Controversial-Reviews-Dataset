Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Though there are a few scenes I wasn\u2019t crazy about\\, this movie blew my mind away! From the special effects to the music\\, the acting and the cinematography. A beautiful movie! Kudos to Mark Hamill and Adam Driver their acting was stupendous!","true":true}
