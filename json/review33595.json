Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible. I had such high hopes for episode 9. Finally see Luke's reaction to Han being killed by Ren. See Rey begin some actual training by someone who knows what they're doing. Maybe pull back the curtain on Snoke\\, is he palpertines master? Is he a fallen Jedi from the purge? The knights of Ren?... but no. No story. No plot. And worse Luke skywalker betrayed worse than any plot twist. The guy didn't stand a chance when you assasinate his character on screen and make fans pay to watch it. Nope sorry I'm done. Never before has Star Wars been just a mother movie.","true":true}
