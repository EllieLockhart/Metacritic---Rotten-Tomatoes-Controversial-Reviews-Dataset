Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Out of the latest trilogy\\, this is by far the worst. Out of all the Star Wars films\\, it is still the worst. It has a few cool scenes in it\\, but it feels poorly written\\, sub-plots that are completely unnecessary (such as the whole Casino Planet scene)\\, and what's most frustrating\\, is that by the end of the film\\, nothing really happened. The plot hasn't really advanced at all\\, a couple of things happened which could have been done within 20 minutes\\, but everything that The Force Awakens set up\\, and got started\\, Rian Johnson took an element of that and went more in a direction that he wanted\\, rather than just what would have been good for the trilogy and the saga. He ruined Luke Skywalkers character\\, he ruined the possible development and direction Snoke's character could have taken us\\, Finn's character development from the end of The Force Awakens was removed from the start of The Last Jedi\\, there was no good character development AT ALL in the whole movie for anyone and when you summarise the movie\\, nothing actually happened and was basically boring with a few elements that kept it just about interesting. To put simply\\, if they said that they were going to remake Episode VIII (and then be able to improve Episode IX because of it)\\, with the same actors etc. but a new writer or JJ Abrams\\, and assume The Last Jedi never happened\\, I would be all up for it.","true":true}
