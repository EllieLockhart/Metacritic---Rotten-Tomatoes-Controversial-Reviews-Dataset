Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed laughing and laughed considerably more than I had in any other Star Wars movie. It had its few and very short powerful moments\\, but contained a lot of filler\\, some of which made me laugh. Disney is divorcing from Star Wars so they can do what they want with it. I dont consider these new films to be Star Wars at all. They make me smirk but that's all.","true":true}
