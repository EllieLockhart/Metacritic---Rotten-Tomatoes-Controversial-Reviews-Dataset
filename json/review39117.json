Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This did not feel like a Star Wars movie.  Without spoiling too much\\, it felt very much like Rian Johnson either had not seen Star Wars or did not care for the Star Wars he did see.  He defied several traditions of Star Wars\\, among them the use of flashbacks and the fact that nobody says \\\"I have a bad feeling about this.\\\"  This by itself would not be a bad thing if the original work that he created stood on its own apart from the traditional Star Wars mythos.  But it doesn't.  He does not build upon the groundwork laid in The Force Awakens.  I've loved every single Star Wars film put to screen thus far - this includes the prequels and the Clone Wars movie - and this is the only one to leave me puzzled at the choices and not really eager to view again.","true":true}
