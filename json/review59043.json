We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"It's sad to see how many of these reviews are people just review-bombing the game. I find it hard to believe so many people managed to finish a 20 hour game in less than a day. Don't get me wrong\\, there are criticisms to be made with the game\\, but most of them are hidden behind 0\/10 reviews submitted by people that haven't even finished the game\\, have only reached a certain point\\, and even some by people who don't have the game and only read the leaks. If you take a look at the reviews on the Last Of Us 2's store page\\, where you actually have to own the game to review\\, you can see a major difference.\r\rOverall\\, I found the experience of Last of Us 2 enjoyable. The graphics were gorgeous\\, and was every bit the technical masterpiece that we had been promised. It looked beautiful and ran smoothly\\, even on the original PS4. The mocap technology was insane\\, and the acting on show here was immersive. I really have to give credit to the actors here\\, they did such a fantastic job of bringing these characters to life.\r\rThe gameplay was similar to the first game\\, mostly stealth mixed with tense moments and adrenaline filled combat. The infected and clickers are even more terrifying than usual\\, and the game does a good job of getting your heart going with a good mix of scares and tension. The combat animations have been improved\\, which makes the combat feel more fluid and overall more enjoyable.\r\rAs for the story... I have mixed feelings on this one\\, but that doesn't mean the story was bad. Certainly not to warrant a 0\/10. Obviously\\, after Joel was killed\\, I was left feeling angry and saddened as most were. From that point\\, I could tell the story was going to be one of revenge. However\\, the story then begins to split off a bit in an attempt to change your perspective\\, which I think was a bit of a hit and miss for some. At first\\, I wasn't a fan of the change\\, but it kept me invested in the story and near the end\\, I didn't know how I was feeling. Once I had reached the ending\\, i was left feeling kind of unsatisfied and lost. A part of me feels like Naughty Dog wanted to leave players feeling that way. I think they made a big risk that for some\\, was not well received.\r\rHowever\\, what it all comes down to is whether I think the experience I got from The Last Of Us 2 was worth spending my money on. For me\\, yes it was. Did the game managed to evoke emotions out of me? Yes. Did it give me happy moments? Sad Moments? Heart wrenching moments? Moments that made me question myself? Question the characters and their motives? Made me disgusted with myself? Yes to all. And to me\\, that's what makes a good story\\, especially a Naughty Dog story.\rI was glad to have enjoyed this experience\\, and I think the ending is one that I need to sit on for a while to see how I truly feel.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
