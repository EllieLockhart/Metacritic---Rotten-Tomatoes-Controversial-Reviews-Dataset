Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie kept me smiling from beginning to end. I've seen it twice now and I loved it both times. I won't go incredibly in depth\\, because this is my opinion\\, but it felt like a true Star Wars experience. I love where Rian Johnson took us in this cinematic adventure\\, and I can't wait to see how J.J. Abrams pulls it all together in the next movie. As for fans that are disappointed\\, the series isn't over yet.","true":true}
