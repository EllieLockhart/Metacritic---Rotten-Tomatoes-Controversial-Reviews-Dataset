Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted a new story (as opposed to a rehash) and they DEFINITELY delivered in this area.  I don't need a movie to be perfect (and this movie was not perfect) but I was very much a fan.  There were scenes that were shocking\\, and scenes that were visually arresting.  It is a great addition to the ever-growing Star Wars collection of movies.  I will definitely be seeing this in the theaters again soon so I can start to digest things more completely.  :)","true":true}
