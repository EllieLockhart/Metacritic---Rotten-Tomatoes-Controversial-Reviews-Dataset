Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a long time Star Wars fan and I took my kids to see TLJ. It was horrible! I will never pay to watch another Star Wars movie again. The pacing was awful\\, the story was complete garbage and the CGI was laughable. A few people left the theater\\, during the quiet scenes people would openly scoff in bewilderment. I was going into this movie with decent expectations\\, not only was I disappointed I feel like the franchise I love is dead. Even my children and my teen son disliked it\\, words can not properly express how ripped off we all felt. Do yourself a favor and stay home!","true":true}
