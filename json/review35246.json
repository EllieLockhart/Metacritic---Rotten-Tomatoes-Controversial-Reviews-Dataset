Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The good:\\nFantastic looking\\, some great space fights. Ben and Rey give great performances. I also really like the code breaker.  \\n\\nThe bad:\\nToo many discontinued plot lines. \\n\\nThey wasted snoke\\, he could have been a much richer character with some sort of history or future impact\\, but he was just a plot device for Ben to rise to the dark side. . . the old emperor had a rich story arch\\, along side everyone else. No one in this movie has a character arch \\n\\nRey is an insta-jedi\\, no training required she's just magic. \\n\\nThe stand in general for Laya was pointlessly elusive with a crap plan. They could have sent the medical support ships into the Republic fleet at light speed.  Or the Republic fleet could have done something similar.  The writing on this left so many gaping plot holes\\, I'm amazed it wasn't stopped in pre-production.","true":true}
