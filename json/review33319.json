Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Surpringly good. Space & fight scenes are amazing. Also quite funny in places. The only problem was that it was a bit too long. Much better than the force awakens. Don't understand why some don't like it. Superb film.","true":true}
