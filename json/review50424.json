Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute lack of harmony with the entire saga. Corruption of the greatest pro and antagonists in cinema history. Lack of fundamentals in even understanding plot or character development. \\nRidley Scott should direct the next one\\, at least he understands how to continue the acumen of a series.","true":true}
