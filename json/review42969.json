Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was terrible.  I gave up seeing Star Wars movies in theaters after the prequels\\, but eventually gave TFA and Rouge One a chance at home.  I liked them\\, and looked forward to finally seeing a Star Wars film in a theater again.  Well\\, that's not happening after seeing this mess of a movie.","true":true}
