Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't really understand why the internet is a place you have to be absolute and either love it or hate it. This is an extremely well made movie\\, and while having a few flaws (all the series does) the good far outweighs the bad. I feel this movie will definitely get better with time. The biggest issues for me is the humor in a few scenes and side story with Rose and Finn I'm not a big fan of. Luke\\, Leigh\\, Rey\\, and Kylo are all amazing and they actually develop Poe which is great. This has a lower rating than Rogue One and that movie had little character development\\, it was pretty choppy\\, and it was boring besides the reshot scenes (Darth Vader horror scene). I'd say overall everyone should give this movie a shot and not pat attention to any of the split reviews. Judge it for yourself.","true":true}
