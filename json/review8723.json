Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For a 2 and a half hour movie it was empty. The battle of Crait was very short and the \\\"battle\\\" between kylo and Luke was something short. Not much action in the movie. The script was kind of strange\\, in parts it is great but in other is vague.","true":true}
