Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst Kylo Ren movie. There is a cool fight in the sand where the sand turns red when he steps in it. Good. Unfortunately half of the movie is wasted on an island casino resort with horses going everywhere and boring side characters that never become relevant. They also kill the alien Snope who was telling Kylo Ren what to do\\, so there's no big bad for the last movie (problematic). And an old man on a different island turns into sand and dies and it turns out he was a ghost the whole time he was fighting. You only find out after the movie that he was from the old Star Wars movies\\, and then only if you ask. 5 stars for Kylo Ren\\, minus 2 stars for wasting my time with unexplained plot points and randos.","true":true}
