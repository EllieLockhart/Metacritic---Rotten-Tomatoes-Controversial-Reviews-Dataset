It breaks my heart to write this\\, as I loved the last game so much\\,  but this game is beyond garbage\\, it trades on the good memories we have of the brilliance of last game and then engages in the most lazy and poor storytelling possible.\r\rForget\\, for a moment\\, the shoehorning of various political issues - that is just a symptom of the lazy storytelling\\, non-existent character development\\, and all-around lack of attention to anything resembling a narrative in this game.   Do yourself a favor.  Don't Buy This.  It will ruin the previous game for you.\r\rStory is garbage\\, Character development is non-existent\\, Motivations are simpler than in a bad children's book...and yes\\, there is a shoehorning of every conceivable hot-topic political issue into the game.  I left that bit for last because I really don't want to be accused of that being my only reason for giving this game a poor review.\r\rSome Positives:\rGameplay mechanics are great\\, but really nothing more than a small improvement on the previous game.\r\rThe world is more open and the story doesn't keep you on rails as much as the last one\\, but because the story is such a thin broth\\, this is a blessing.\r\rThe map is much better and the levels of difficulty are more in-depth.\rThe photo-mode is nice.\r\rBut that's about it.  This game is the opposite of a continuation of something good.  It is a negation of the last game.  Don't play if you want to keep your memories of the franchise positive.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
