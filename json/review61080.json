The first half of the game is largely a walking simulator with nonstop relationship drama. After some questionable story decisions It devolves into flashback inception\\, forcing you to play a new\\, boring character. With no spoilers\\, this character did something controversial\\, and then the game makes you play 8-10 hours of flashbacks within flashbacks AS them to try to make you like the character. There is no liking this person. It was ultimately just a side quest with more characters you dont care about. The game could have finished 3 hours in and the conclusion\\, the state of all the characters you care about\\, would be the same.\r\rA sad state for this franchise and even sadder for the critics. Honestly who **** knows how reviewers managed to give this above a 5\\, let alone Game of The Year scores...\u2026 Expand","true":true}
