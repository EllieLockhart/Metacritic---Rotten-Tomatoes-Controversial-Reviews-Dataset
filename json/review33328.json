Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Surprises\\, laughter\\, shock and awe\\, this movie delivers a lot. I have a few minor things to moan about but I wont because I have faith they will be addressed in the final instalment. Every Star Wars film has its fans and critics - I watched the first movie every day before and after school when I was a kid but I don't presume to tell the filmmakers how to do their job or what story I think they should create\\, I prefer the journey through the good and bad (prequels I mainly disliked due to Jar Jar\\, Haydn Christiansen cardboard acting and the severe over use of CGI).....TLJ is a strong\\, surprising film which leaves the audience thrilled with the action and somewhat confused by some of the deicsions\\, but those decisions may well prove to be right when seen in context with episode 9. Overall a good movie with a lot happening and some great action\\, character arcs and some serious belly laughs....fingers crossed the final instalment explains some of the loose ends.","true":true}
