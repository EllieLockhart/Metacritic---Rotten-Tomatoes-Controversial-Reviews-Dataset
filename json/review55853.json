Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pros: \\n-Best Starwars visually\\n-Performance of characters introduced in The Force Awakens\\n\\nCons: \\n-Butchered storylines established in TFA (Rey's parents\\, the entire character of Snoke by revealing his identity in person and killing him with no explanation of his origins or his connection to anything\\, Captian Phasmas anticlimactic death)\\n-Tried to establish new characters instead of building on previous ones (Rose - the equivalent of Jar Jar\\, purple-haired female captain - wrong actor for part and altogether annoying\\, Luke - script and acting felt very dry and boring\\, Yoda - no reason for him other than to show that force-ghosts can make lightning)\\n-Countless plot holes (Use of hyper-speed as a weapon which could have been used to destroy the Death Star or the medical ships could have done the same instead of running out of fuel\\, First Order's inability to catch rebel ships\\, why did Luke make a map at all?\\, how did Rey master the Force in a few lessons\\, what was the point of the Fin and Rose's adventure to the casino planet?)\\n-Felt directed by someone who didn't understand the Star Wars universe\\n-Humor was childish\\n-Inclusion of very dumb scenes (Princess Leah \\\"flying\\\"\\, everything on the casino planet\\, Luke getting \\\"milk\\\")\\n-\\\"Hollywood liberal bias\\\" This point is more subjective but I feel there are things worth addressing. (The inclusion of diversity in TFA was terrific because it was done in a not-in-your-face way and the characters introduced were interesting while playing a role in the plot. In TLJ the female characters feel forced in for the sake of diversifying the cast while being poor and uninteresting actors. Poe and Rose's adventure to the casino planet felt entirely out of place and included as a stab at capitalism\\, which can be noted by lines in the movie. The \\\"selling weapons\\\" issue\\, while can be seen as non-partisan\\, felt political. The crew of the First Order prominently dominated by Caucasian males while the Resistance's crew is very diverse. Admiral Holdo became a main character with no buildup and clearly resembles a typical Hollywood feminist advocate in her portrayal in the movie. Poe)\\n\\nI can see how the political bias isn't as important to others but it personally left a sour taste in my mouth while watching the movie. Regardless of political bias\\, the rampant plot problems\\, terrible new characters\\, and complete dismissal of TFA and even all previous Star Wars movies made this movie the worst Star Wars yet. \\n\\nAlmost as disappointing as The Last Airbender movie.","true":true}
