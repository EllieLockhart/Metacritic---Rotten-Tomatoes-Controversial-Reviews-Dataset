Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Why are viewers ripping this movie to pieces??? I was a huge fan. Huge Star Wars fan\\, I was basically raised on the original trilogy cassette tapes. I liked this film because it expanded on some of the understanding of what the force is and allowed some characters to go through some self discovery. And honestly\\, I feel like all the characters where pretty authentic and relatable. There's a lot of grey area and it's not the same good v. bad simple that's present in most if the other films. Only critique would be that it tried too hard to be funny \/ cute. Had too much of a Marvel flavor to it in some ways.","true":true}
