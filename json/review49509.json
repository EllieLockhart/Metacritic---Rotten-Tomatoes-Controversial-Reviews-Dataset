Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow\\,cant believe how bad this was.Its a mess and has probably killed off Star wars for DIsney.\\nAlso cant believe the critic scores.GOes to show that the only truth out there is by digging around ral peoples views on the net.\\nDisney definately has the critics afraid to write a truthful review","true":true}
