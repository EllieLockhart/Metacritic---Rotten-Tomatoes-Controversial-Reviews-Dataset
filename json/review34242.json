Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"That... was a great Star Wars movie. It took risks\\, it shattered expectations\\, it didn't care what Star Wars geeks wanted... it burned the tree down. Add to that beautiful visuals\\, good pacing\\, amazing performances\\, a lot of symbolism and the right amounts of humor\\, cheesiness and heart.\\n\\nWould've liked to have seen one of the big characters fleshed out a bit more as well as some Lucasian political intrigue (what makes the SW universe unique)\\, but this movie was a stark contrast to the timid and insulting scene-for-scene imitation that Force Awakens was. Rian Johnson is the man.","true":true}
