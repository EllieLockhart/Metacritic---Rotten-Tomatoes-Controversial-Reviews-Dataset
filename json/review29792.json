Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ridiculous script\/story for a multi-billion dollar movie. All that money and legions of writers\\, and the best they could come up with is a circular slow-motion chase scene for a major portion of the movie. Viewers pity Poe and Finn being constantly chastised and emasculated. Create something new instead of dumping all over what used to be an entertaining franchise (excluding jarjar)\\, but Disney knows they can cultivate more shekels if they pull the strings of faux-nostalgia that permanently crippled millennial child-adults seem to possess for star wars. The other part of the story (about an hour of the film) is relatively interesting\\, even if Luke does essentially nothing. And wtf is Yoda doing burning books. Guess who also burned books? Nazis. godwin law complete","true":true}
