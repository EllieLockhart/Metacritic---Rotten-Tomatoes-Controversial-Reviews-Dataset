Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was ok. I love the new characters and the direction the story is taking them\\, but the original characters are being handled poorly. That was not Luke Skywalker in this movie.  He deserved better. \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" plot line revolved around finding him\\, serttinhg this movie up in a big way for something that never materialized.  So many cool possibilities lost.","true":true}
