Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie completely ruined the stories and interest from the Force awakens. Really bad characters almost makes this movie completely unwatchable for me. This was the first Star wars movie I've only watched one time and never want to see it again. The social justice and feminist agenda completely destroyed any possible enjoyment I could have gotten from the film. I wish it never existed honestly.","true":true}
