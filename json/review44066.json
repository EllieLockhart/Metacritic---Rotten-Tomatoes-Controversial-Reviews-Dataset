Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ is a terrific film.  The 2.5 hrs flew by\\, and as the end approached\\, I wished it would not end (10 PM showing).  The characters were compelling and well defined.  The pacing was tight and the action sequences propelled plot and character all while being nail biting and exhilarating.  I would get be it 5 stars\\, but why on earth was a non-force wielding praetorian able to restrain Kylo Ren?  That was sloppy.  If they wanted to have Rey Save Kylo like he saved her\\, they should have done it in a way that retained the superiority of the Force.","true":true}
