Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worse Star Wars movie of all time\\, now i understand why Mark Hamill hate everything about his character. The movie is empty\\, Full of goofy humor and a lot of disney teenager trash. George i forgive you for jar jar Binks and the \\\"high ground\\\" thing\\, now I see the prequel that I hate so much with other eyes.","true":true}
