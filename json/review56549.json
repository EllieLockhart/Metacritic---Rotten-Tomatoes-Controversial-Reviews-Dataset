Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi has a lot going for it. The visuals look pretty well-crafted (apart from a certain scene towards the end)\\, the action is quite engaging\\, and as a whole it's a very solid production. It appeals incredibly well to a mass audience\\, and I'd argue it's the best Star Wars film in that regard. However\\, it comes at the price of actively demolishing the previously established mythos and rules of the franchise\\, and this is key to consider\\, because it means that the film sacrifices a lot of running elements that many people would consider very important and beloved.\\n\\nWithout going too much into spoilers\\, the film acts almost as a full reset of the entire franchise. What many people believed were integral to the franchise (such as how certain characters are written\\, and how a general Star Wars should be built) are made an example of\\, and then disregarded with the reason of 'people have seen that\\, the old ways need to be abandoned'. This isn't strictly a bad direction at all\\, and it makes perfect sense given the franchise's history in the past 20 years. But to do so while attacking what made Star Wars good for large portions of the fanbase\\, simply isn't right in my opinion. Rian Johnson could have reached the same result with different means\\, and potentially pleased just about everyone while doing so\\, but he hasn't\\, and now with the position that the franchise is left in\\, I think it's going to have a lot of people questioning whether they want to stick around anymore.\\n\\nIn my own case\\, I am happy to see this film doing successfully\\, I love Star Wars as a franchise\\, and it's very dear to me. But if the direction proposed in this film is the way they want to go on in the future? I guess it's just not for me anymore. At least someone else will like it","true":true}
