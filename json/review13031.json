Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don\u2019t get the reason people bash on this movie so much. It\u2019s a Star Wars movie\\, and it acts as such. It went into spaces and boundaries no other SW movie had dared to enter\\, it took risks\\, unlike The Force Awakens. Yes it is not perfect\\, but with the plot and story they did follow\\, they executed it as well as I could dream for. ","true":true}
