Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible story! Without a doubt worst Star Wars movie (so far). Poor writing\\, poor directing\\, and plot holes aplenty.  It's as if Disney doesen't want to make money. If your not a fan of Star Wars or continuity and plot holes dont concern you\\, then perhaps you can find some enjoyment out of this film. As for me\\, the amazing visuals\\, CGI\\, and score is the only reason worth watching.","true":true}
