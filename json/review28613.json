Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Production values and an epic franchise wasted on a toddler-esque diatribe against Star Wars fans\\, in which the entire franchise's story\\, including Force Awakens story-lines\\, are crumpled up and thrown in the trash. Character arcs are betrayed\\, and the entire thing feels like a disjointed mess. Fully 1\/2 the plot is wasted on a literally pointless mission\\, created by a contrived series of actions that make no logical sense. There are few things to appreciate in the film\\, so if you are going to see it\\, turn off your brain\\, pretend it's a stand-alone film\\, and enjoy the visuals\\, because that's all there really is.","true":true}
