Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Being a die hard Star Wars fan\\, what a major misstep in the last movie and even bigger misstep in this movie. Taking about no even close to see the potential. What a major let down\\, where it could have been great. What a shame! Ruined!!! ","true":true}
