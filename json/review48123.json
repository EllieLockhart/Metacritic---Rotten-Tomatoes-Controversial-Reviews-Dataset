Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While there are some redeeming elements of the film\\, especially the exquisite craftsmanship of the film itself. Nobody can realistically say it was not well made. However\\, TLJ viewed on it's totality makes me pine for the the sense and sensibility of the prequel trilogy. So many thing happen that utterly take me out of the film or create such blatant questions that my enjoyment of the film became tainted. To name but a few: Hyperspace ramming\\, gravity bombs\\, the ridiculous time frames of a chase scene that allowed someone to come and go from a ship (in the middle of the chase) to another planet all while the 'chase scene' continues\\, force projection\\, and so on.  TLJ just makes no sense.","true":true}
