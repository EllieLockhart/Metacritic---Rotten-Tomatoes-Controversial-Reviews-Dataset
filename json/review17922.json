Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i think a lot of starwars fans are getting extremely butthurt that the last jedi basically said f u to all there theories and created something entirely new and refreshing within the starwars universe. i loved the movie especially the visuals and plot twists. there are a few plot holes but starwars has never really had a strong plotline its more about the action and visuals. ive seen all the other movies and i really enjoyed the new direction and ideas this movie had as well as the realism that sometimes heroic plans dont always work out. \\nso if youre an openminded starwars fan or anyone else definitely worth your money.\\nbut if youre a butthurt starwars fan stuck in the past and allergic to change you should give it a miss.","true":true}
