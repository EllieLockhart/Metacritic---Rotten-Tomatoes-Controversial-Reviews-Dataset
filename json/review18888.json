Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a shame what they did to Luke Skywalker\\, the character deserved better than this and it's upsetting to see a childhood hero disrespected like this. What a horrible way to end the Luke Skywalker Saga......\\nThere where some awesome parts of this movie\\, great battles and cool new planets and some cool new characters.....Ray\\, Ren and Poe where great....\\nBut NONE of the questions everyone has had since Awakens where anwsered\\, it makes me feel like I wasted time getting excited about this movie. What a waste of characters Snoke and Phantasm where....\\nMakes me wish George Lucas was still in charge\\, j would have loved to see the rest of his vision.","true":true}
