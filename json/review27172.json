Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the worst plots I've consumed as an adult. The \\\"great chase\\\" makes no sense when you stop to think about it for even just 5 minutes. And the last battle completely fails as an action scene. This movie departs from all things Star Wars.","true":true}
