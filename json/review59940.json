I honestly think it's ridiculous how much negativity this game is receiving. I especially think this game is receiving unfair negative reviews from honestly\\, homophobes.\r\rThe gameplay is genuinely superb. There wasn't a moment where I felt fully captivated in each encounter and had a variety of options to approach. The combat system is great and provides even a small-thrilling challenge even on moderate. No game is really enjoyable if you can go through the whole game with barely a scratch.\rThere were moments where I got jumped by scares and felt anxious to press forward. I loved the thrill the game provided. Most of all the game provided fluid close quarter combat. I found this to be one of the game's best new mechanics. Being able to dodge melee enemies and counter attack felt really fluid and fun. The game provides you with enough creativity when approaching different groups of hostiles.\r\rThe story was captivating from beginning to end. In contrast to most user reviews\\, I grew emotionally attached to the characters. I personally was satisfied\\, yet unsatisfied with the ending (but in a good way). With the way the game unfolds and plays out\\, I felt like Naughty Dog took the best approach to end the game. I felt quite similar to the first game's ending. The characters have a lot of depth and growth as the game progresses. I found the direction of the story to be great! It was unorthodox\\, in that it sowed the present and past to tell a great emotional story.\r\rDespite what other reviews say\\, this game deserves the score that Naughty Dog worked so hard for. 10\/10. I genuinely am saddened by the negativity user's are giving it just because the story may have not gone the way they wanted it to. Especially the negative reviews that are bashing the game solely because it contains a homosexual couple. I\u2019m also under the impression that a lot of people who reviewed the game also didn\u2019t finish the game. I felt like it was an authentic aspect with the characters\\, in no way did it feel forced. Most user reviews act like the writers pooped the bed and just developed a \\\"fund-raiser\\\" game. I think Naughty Dog did a phenomenal job. No game is perfect and will satisfy you in every way\\, but this game was extremely enjoyable and gave me a lot to think about when I wasn't playing.\r\rThis game definitely deserves your attention and a full play through. Do I think this game is perfect? No. However\\, I do think this game deserves the high score with all of its production qualities\\, story telling mechanics\\, and enjoyable gameplay. I very much enjoyed this game and would put this in my PS4\/Xbox One generation top 3!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
