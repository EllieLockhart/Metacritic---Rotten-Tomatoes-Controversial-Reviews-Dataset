Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As the conflict between the First Order and The Resistance grows\\, so do our heroes from both the original and sequel trilogy. The Last Jedi evokes a character-driven narrative akin to The Empire Strikes Back\\, to wonderful effect.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi is an excellent sequel to The Force Awakens. The writing is thoughtful and well done\\, and left me wanting more. The growth that nearly every main character experiences throughout the course of the film is immensely satisfying. The Last Jedi pays homage to the legacy of the past and also looks forward to the future.\\n\\nAdam Driver\\, Daisy Ridley\\, and Mark Hamill in particular are spectacular\\, and very engaging when on screen. The rest of the cast is fantastic as well\\, even if not every line of dialogue is a masterpiece.\\n\\nI have seen the Last Jedi many times since\\, and enjoy each return. If you are eager to delve deeper into the character's from The Force Awakens and watch the new galactic conflict unfold\\, then you will most likely enjoy this movie!","true":true}
