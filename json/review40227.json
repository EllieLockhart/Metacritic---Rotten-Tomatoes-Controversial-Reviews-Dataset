Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not the movie I was looking for.  Wish I could Jedi Mind Trick Rian Johnson into redoing this horrendous mess.\\n\\nThere were plotholes large enough to fly the Millenium Falcon through.  Humor that isn't funny and doesn't work for a Star Wars movie.  Punchable new characters like Jar Jar 2.0 or otherwise known as Rose.  Rey is suddenly a master jedi without any training.  Not enough battle scenes and no real villian to look forward to in the next movie.","true":true}
