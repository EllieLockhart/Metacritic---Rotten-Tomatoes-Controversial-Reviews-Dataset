Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Save you money and avoid this movie. I thought it was horrible. It was like a bunch of 12 year olds wrote it. The plot is not chronologically laid out. Things were thrown in for no apparent reason like that trip to the Monte Carlo Star Wars Bar scene. The character make up seemed for no reason other than to placate some consultant. The technical part was bad. One minute the character would have a huge scar. The next minute the scar was gone or reduced in size. It seemed to go on and on and on. Events were not explained like how bad off the rebellion was. Leah being sucked out in space then pushing herself back in? Then the bridge was fixed?  It was distressing to see such a fine movie franchise laid to waste.","true":true}
