Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Basically what everyone says in the bad reviews. Boring\\, slow and tries to be way too deep for a Star Wars movie. Just plan horrible. We left after 1.5 hours. I\u2019m sure someone will say it gets better or the end is great but who cares\\, what we saw was awful","true":true}
