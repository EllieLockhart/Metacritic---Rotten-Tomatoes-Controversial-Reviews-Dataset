Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What the force? Overlong and largely incoherent. Most of the time characters are standing still looking at something. 'Force'd humour trying to emulate Marvel just doesn't work. The biggest spoiler is\\,\\,\\, The Last Jedi is just not that good.","true":true}
