Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson directs the space saga into new territory with a sure hand: his visuals are astounding\\, his characters are genuine\\, and his decisions are bold. If The Force Awakens breathed new life into the franchise\\, The Last Jedi branches it out in truly creative ways. With humor\\, twists\\, and some of the best action scenes of the entire series\\, The Last Jedi is an amazingly fun ride that exceeds (and subverts) expectations.","true":true}
