Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Is guess it's worth half a star for their CGI or something? Acting was lame\\, characters lame\\, development lame\\, story atrocious\\, casino sequence unnecessary\\, weird subversive scenes undertones\\, betrayed Luke's character (by making him try to kill Kylo)\\, stupid attempts to \\\"trick\\\" audience for the sake of it\\, and it just fell flat compared to The Force Awakens. They had SOOOO many chances to make this good\\, and it was terrible. All they needed to do was to continue the story that TFA had started. This was a train wreck. I fully expected to love this movie\\, and it just didn't deliver.","true":true}
