Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Aside from the throne room scenes this was an awful movie.  The intro jokes that Poe had left me scratching my head \\, the bombs that fall in outer space \\, everything about the casino planet was just awful \\, the whole space floating thing \\, Luke being a bad mix of old Ben and Yoda . Not 1 single light saber duel .  The kid at the way end of the movie that used the force gave me little hope for redemption in the final . Oh and the stuttering on the slicer guy made me almost leave .","true":true}
