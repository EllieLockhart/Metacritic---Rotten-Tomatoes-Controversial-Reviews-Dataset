Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As an honest Star Wars fan\\, I can honestly say I was immensely disappointed with this film. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.\\n\\n*SPOILERS AHEAD*\\n40 minutes of the movie that risked people's lives all started from a lack of communication. If you think about it\\, if Rey and Finn had never been on the destroyer\\, that guy wouldn't have betrayed them and almost everyone on the lifeboats wouldn't have been killed.\\n\\nThey ruined Luke's character and made him a grumpy\\,  old hermit who just disappears at the end. \\n\\nThey added in unnecessary people like Rose\\, who had sub-par acting.\\n\\nThey just randomly killed off Snoke\\, who was so powerful that he couldn't sense a lightsaber being turned next to his hand.\\n\\nKylo looked even more like a little kid than the last one with more tantrums after he feels disapproval from Snoke\\, his screaming in the AT-AT\\, and wears his pants way too high\\, making him look like Steve Urkel.\\n\\nIt felt like the director was a seven year old with the \\\"Leia's gonna die\\, no she's not gonna die\\, yeah\\, she's gonna die\\, no shes not\\\" forms of suspense.\\n\\nLet's not forget the famous line we're gonna win this war by saving what we love\\, not killing what we hate. \\nReally\\, Rose? Really? We cant do both at the same time? Because you're the girl who thinks the entire galaxy's freedom is worth risking to let loose a couple of giraffe-horse things that get caught MINUTES LATER\\, almost getting yourself caught again in the process.","true":true}
