Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Star Wars film to be this divisive between fans when it was released was... you guessed it\\, The Empire Strikes Back. The Last Jedi is also the best Star Wars film since ESB. Director Rian Johnson has tool it upon himself to take the Star Wars saga to places it's never been before. Give it time people. In a few years I promise this chapter will be held in much higher regard. Keep in mind there is still another film in this trilogy.","true":true}
