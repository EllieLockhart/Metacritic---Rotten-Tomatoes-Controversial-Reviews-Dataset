Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If it weren't a Star Wars movie\\, this could be decent.  With this film they disrespect the force entirely\\, any guidelines you may have thought there were are gone.  So many plot holes\\, unnecessary scenes\\, no big reveals\\, and cringeworthy twists.  Anyone who is a casual fan might enjoy this\\, but if you grew up with Star Wars\\, you know better.  It has nothing to do with how it makes you feel or nostalgia\\, the last Jedi just simply fails when there was potential for so much more.  After decades of being a fan of the franchise\\, I went to bed for the first time in my life not a Star Wars fan.","true":true}
