Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film felt like a new Star Wars to me\\, it embraced the themes and mystical qualities that made Star Wars what it was before the prequels. While some elements may have been too much\\, some of the humor\\, this was a fantastic addition to the Star Wars mythos. I don't understand half of these extremely negative reviews. ","true":true}
