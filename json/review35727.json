Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a well made\\, well-written\\, well-directed film that will still divide audiences depending on what kind of start wars story they hoped would be told.  For me\\, every idea I had about where the story was going for Snoke\\, for Luke\\, for Rey\\, on the question of Rey's parents\\, or for Kylo were totally off from what was revealed in the film - and I loved the film for it.  In particular I loved Luke's story even though it was nothing like I expected.  This movie turned a number of star wars (and more broadly sci-fci\/action) film tropes on their heads\\, and did this in very satisfying ways.  The movie was full of breathtaking action shot masterfully and delivered emotion rich characters that I genuinely cared about.  The movie was not flawless\\, as no movies are.  It tried a little too hard on the humor at points\\, following contemporary trends to copy a formula.  But good news\\, a lot of the humor is well-timed and feels right\\, with only a few instances that felt out of place in a star wars film.  There are a handful of scenes that just don't work as well as was intended - most notably on scene with a flying person that\\, while meant to be meaningful and dramatic\\, ended up looking like bad effects and silly (and also without clear point or purpose).  But to be clear hear\\, that was a 15 second scene out of a 2.5 hour movie.  This movie was really good and quality.  And yet it will probably divide fans completely\\, because like I said before\\, none of the \\\"big questions\\\" we had in our mind going into the film got answered in any way that I would have guessed.  You either like the direction the story took\\, or you don't - and that will be the reason you either love or hate the movie.","true":true}
