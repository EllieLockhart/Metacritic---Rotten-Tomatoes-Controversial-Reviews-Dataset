Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really bad writing\\, poor characters and misplaced attempts at humour. This film is Rian Johnson's own work of fan fiction except one thing is clear from this film and his response to the intelligent fans - he is not a fan of Star Wars\\, no supposed fan would cut Luke's balls off. Just a note he also used a non-canon book to justify the long distance Jedi phone call \\, what a tool.","true":true}
