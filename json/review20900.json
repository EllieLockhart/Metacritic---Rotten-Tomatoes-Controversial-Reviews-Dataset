Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was concerned with all the low reviews on this film.  What did they do?  I am 44 years old and grew up with the franchise.   I loved The Force Awakens and Rogue One.\\n\\nIn fact i loved the brave approachbtheybhave been taking\\, not afraid to kill off the leads.\\n\\nI have been reading some if the complaints and feel most of those people just need a safe place to hide.\\n\\nThe visuals were terrific.  The story line took a great turn.   I won't spoil too much here\\, but save it for discussions.  But the director has insured that the storyline can now love on from the past.","true":true}
