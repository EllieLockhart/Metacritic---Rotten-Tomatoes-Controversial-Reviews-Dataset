{"101487":169375,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers ahead:\\n. Luke's direction. Just imagine for a second what would happen to the Harry Potter Saga if Dumbledore is turned into a hermit that acts like a caveman\\, doesn't wield his magic wand to protect those he loves\\, and throws away harry's wand just because its fun? That's exactly what Luke did. Actually worse\\, the lightsaber was his dad's. \\n2. The Casino scene. Let's all go to a Casino to find something from someone\\, and once we find that something from someone\\, it will no longer care because the First Order already caught us.\\n3. Ackbar's dead--just a passing reference\\, a throwaway comment.\\n 4. There's an essential element in storytelling: tension. This movie kills all tension when the main antagonist is thrown for a very stupid reason\\, once he's established as an all-knowing dark force. This kills all tension. Same as that casino scene\\, with its whole subplot about dog racing that leads nowhere. \\n5. A second element of storytelling this movie seems to forget about: motivations. Rey is just doing the Rey stuff. A complete Mary Sue. No change\\, no wonder\\, just Rey. It had the potential to become an extremely complex character\\, now we know she's a goodie two shoes. \\n6. Why have del Toro's DJ\\, when Lando's actor is still around? no idea. Serves EXACTLY the same purpose as Lando.\\n7. Chewie and 3PO? Oh\\, just 5 minutes doing... the Porg thing or whatever. Chewie still has contacts with the crime sindicates according to TFA\\, why bring a completely disconnected scene with Maz (who had Anakin's saber) to talk about the crime sindicates?\\n8. Again... MAz and \\\"her secrets\\\". The Knights of Ren? Even Disney doesn't know what to do with them.\\n9. The length. It's a direct product of sloppy storytelling. The whole casino scene could've been cut\\, because it doesn't even develop Finn's character any further.\\n10. John WIlliam's score? Fading in the dark\\, just like this whole trilogy.\\nOh\\, let's not forget... the forced humor\\, and the cringe inducing \\\"you created Kylo Ren!\\\" quote. Snoke calling Kylo \\\"Spunk\\\"? Lol. I don't see where's the quality in that.","true":true}
