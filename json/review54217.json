Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"IF YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT THE FIRST TIME\\, WATCH IT AGAIN. Very good movie. However\\, the first time I watched it\\, I was very disappointed. I had expected it to feel like the Force Awakens more than other did\\, which allowed some of the weird parts to bother me more than they should have. I liked all of the main plot choices\\, but didn't like the movie as a whole too much. But\\, I calmed down and decided to watch it again. This time\\, I knew to expect the different feel of the movie and went in again optimistically. It was so much better! The 2 stars I originally gave it on Rotten Tomatoes became 4 stars. Although I already liked all of the main plot points and big reveals the first time\\, I appreciated them more as I let them decide how much I liked the movie. Sure\\, I still felt that the Canto Bight scenes felt unimportant\\, that Rose's character didn't belong in a saga film (even though I liked her)\\, that Finn became a pretty flat character\\, and that the odd scene with Leia did not make sense. But\\, these are more minor disappointments. The movie was well done. I recommend it! Force Awakens was still my favorite though :)","true":true}
