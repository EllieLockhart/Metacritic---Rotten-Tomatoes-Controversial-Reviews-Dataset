Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An incredible film.  Very complicated and well-plotted\\, with several plots\/plot arcs perfectly tied in together.  A very deep and thought-provoking film\\, too\\, diving deeper into the Force than any other Star Wars movie.  Plenty of character development - especially for Luke; Mark Hamill gives his best performance yet.  Enjoyed the themes.  While more plot- and theme-centric than prior installments\\, the action we get is fantastic - especially the Holdo Maneuvre!  The special effects are dazzling\\, and the music score great.  And oh\\, that climax!  A highly recommended film.","true":true}
