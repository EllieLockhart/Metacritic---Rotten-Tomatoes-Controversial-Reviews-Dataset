Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I could write a novel on how bad this movie was.  Instead I will leave it as they didn't do justice to not only the old characters\\, but Ryan Johnson did not do the new characters any favors by developing them any further.  I have no desire to learn more about them and thats a shame.  ","true":true}
