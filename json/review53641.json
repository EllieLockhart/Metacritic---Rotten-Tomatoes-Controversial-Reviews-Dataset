Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First the good part\\,\\nIt has some fantastic shots and scenes that look really great. Kylo's and Rey's storylines are great. Seeing Luke and (puppet) Yoda back onscreen is also great. The rebel ship launching itself into the enemy ships\\, fantastic shot.\\nBut\\, and here comes the bad stuff...\\nFinn's story is not good\\, its garbage. Pretty much the worst subplot in all of the Star Wars movies. The rebels trying to outrun the first order is pretty much as bad as the Finn story. Why do the several rebel ships not share all of their fuel with the main ship if they end up jumping ship anyway? Why do the rebel shipcaptains let their ships be destroyed when they too could have done a suicide run into the enemy ships?","true":true}
