Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think this was a great movie for the series\\, yes certain plot points weren't addressed from.the last movie but nothing lead us to believe they would be either.\\n\\nGreat cinematography\\, the characters were fleshed out in most cases\\, the moments of brevity were enjoyable some were childish but they were enjoyable all the same.\\n\\nLuke's storyline is human\\, it makes sense why he does what he does. The reveal of the relationship between Luke\\, Ren and Snoke was well done and interesting.\\n\\nThe new characters were interesting\\, some definitely felt like setups for an extended universe and the next films but they established their place and point of view with the limited time they had.\\n\\nOverall a good movie\\, not without flaws but a good addition to the franchise.","true":true}
