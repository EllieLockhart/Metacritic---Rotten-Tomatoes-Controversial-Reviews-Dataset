Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to love this edition to Star Wars but I just can't. I was very disappointed with the movie as a whole. It was just too predictable and the attempt at humor was just stupid. I don't know if I even want to see the last movie in this trilogy. ","true":true}
