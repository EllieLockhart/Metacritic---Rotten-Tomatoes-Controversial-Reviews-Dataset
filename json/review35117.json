Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force Awakens --- Fans Criticized because there wans't inovation\\nThe Last Jedi ---- Fans Criticized because there was inovation\\n\\nDisney should stop doing Star Wars movies\\, and not because the new movies are bad\\, because the fans doesn't deserve to have new movies.","true":true}
