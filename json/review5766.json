Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointed and left the cinema knowing this isn't a film I would be in a rush to see again.   Luke deserved a better end and where did all these new force powers come from.   Death's were too cheap for all sides.   Ship chase was super crap.  They have ion cannon's in star wars why not use that instead of a slow crawl. Plus the chasing pack would have had thousands of fighters to do damage.  Poor quality writing etc.  Throws some star wars facts out of the window and invents new ones without any word.  Has the director ever seen a star wars film?","true":true}
