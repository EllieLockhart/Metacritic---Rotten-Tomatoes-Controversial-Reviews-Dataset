Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a very fresh and original entry to the Star Wars franchise\\, building off of and topping its predecessor. It brings new and intriguing ideas to the table. It takes it's characters to new places and makes them feel more real than ever\\, making one of the series' most interesting and complex villains. But it's not without its flaws\\, with a few ridiculous and unnecessary scenes\\, this certainly wont be the film in the franchise to top The Empire Strikes Back.","true":true}
