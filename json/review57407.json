Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a god damn disappointment. Not only they killed one of the most beloved characters from the series but he also died from the hands of the worst character from the trilogy. The choice for the actors for the last Jedi were TERRIBLE and a big bunch of money grabbing bastards. I don't think the trilogy would be better of unfinished but if this was gonna be their comeback they would have been better of dead in our hopes and dreams. The problem is for example Marvel studios created Thanos in the MCU where they kept on telling that he exists. Because the movie didn't do something of this sort and was dead for over 7 years returning\\, killing key characters\\, replacing them with characters that are worse then teesing that this is not the end makes this movie TERRIBLE.","true":true}
