Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the one that took me from \\\"yeah\\, I like Star Wars just fine\\\" to a full-on die-hard fan of the franchise.","true":true}
