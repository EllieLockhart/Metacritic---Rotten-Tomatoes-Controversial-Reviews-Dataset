Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Brief moments showcase creativity and talent of the production team. These are crushed by an under-edited script and rushed\\, assembly-line production-timetable. I love change and risks\\, as long as there is a pay-off rather than a cash-grab. Disney\\, slow down\\, revise\\, and edit. I'll gladly wait an extra few years if it means a refined product. Hamill is a gem\\, Ridley and actors others do well with what they're given. The hyperspace attack is new and gorgeous. If the prequels were burdened by a sense of legendary self-importance\\, the writing went too far the other direction and turned this movie into a Mystery Science Theater 3000 parody of itself.  Let me explain. Except for the recycled gag at the beginning played too long\\, I generally enjoyed the humor\\, which always had a place in Star Wars. I actually enjoyed the casino\\, and like that the heroes' wacky schemes don't always work\\, but cannot forgive the ridiculous movie-long chase contrived to make it possible. The big problem is the characters are wasted. Rey\\, more like little Anakin and less like Luke (who constantly failed\\, learned\\, and had to be rescued) remains overpowered to the point of blandness. In writing an invincible female heroine\\, she seems more like unforgivably wasted Phasma than Leia or non-canon Mara Jade. Luke and Poe (maybe the latter should have died in the first installment) are unrecognizable.  Hux lost all potential as a terrifying true believer as he became a mustache-twirling clown. Snoke is nihilistically tossed aside (I'm not buying a book series to find out more).  *The beauty of the original trilogy is the teamwork of the three mains as they grow and rescue each other.* Not here. I'll probably stay home for the third movie. I'm disappointed with Disney's strong-arm tactics against theaters\\, the \\\"good-enough\\\" rushed editing\\, and with the raving professional critics obliged to praise to the moon an uneven popcorn flick.","true":true}
