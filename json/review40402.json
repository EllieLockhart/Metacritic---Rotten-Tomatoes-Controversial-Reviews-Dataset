Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the 8th Star Wars movie that I have watched and I grew up watching the original series. It continues with the theme from the \u201cRogue One\u201d\\, you don\u2019t have to be the royalty to be the hero. ","true":true}
