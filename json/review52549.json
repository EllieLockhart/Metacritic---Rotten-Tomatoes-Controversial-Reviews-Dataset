Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Aimless and pointless. Rubbish from beginning to end. Worse than The Force Awakens and I cannot believe that that is possible. This new trilogy is a worthless steaming pile of nonsense. Forgettable characters\\, forgettable locations\\, forgettable nostalgia points\\, forgettable score\\, zero vision\\, zero creativity. Rubbish just like Looper.","true":true}
