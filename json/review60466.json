While I enjoyed playing as Ellie & Abby but both Characters Overall Plot Was executed very messy & confusing and left me feeling very dissatisfied. I commend all the hard work put in to making this game from the Art & graphics even including the gameplay but I cannot complement the story aspects. I now understand why the previous Head team at Naughty Dog Development on the first Last Of Us didn't want to Do a Revenge plot on the first game. Why the New Head director choose to do the same for the sequel is beyond me. Unfortunately I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to anyone considering all the crunch culture the employees at Naughty Dog had to go through leading to people leaving the studio\\, even including all the people who were effected by the DMCA stike takedown & the threat of loosing their Channel on YouTube just for having a opinion on this game. While I hate to say it but I am making a hard choice and will not be looking forward to anything else coming from Naughty Dog Studio anymore\\, not untill the Studio takes a long look at what they need to do moving forward in order to make a good game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
