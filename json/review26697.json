Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok. Ok.  I am writing a review because I have so many SW questions that are either explained with a move along type of answer or are ignored completely and left in a place where if they do address later it wont be worth knowing.  That being said I have decided to move along and not hold this against them.  It is completely out with the old and in with the new.  The movie is entertaining and overall enjoyable.  The removal of the 1 and half stars is for the parts that are so bad and questions that are destroyed.  Its a solid 8 as a movie its about a 2 if you want some super reveals or at least logical explanations that fall within the science of the star wars universe.","true":true}
