Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am at a lost why the critics and a lot of the audience love this movie. From a narrative\/story structure perspective\\, it's a total mess. It doesn't fit in well with the rest of the Star Wars universe both tone and story wise. Sure it sounds good and looks great though. What they did to Luke's character is a travesty. The hero of the OT completely mishandled. The choices that he makes in this film aren't consistent with who is was in the OT. And his death scene is a total joke. What a waste of a movie. Completely disappointed. ","true":true}
