Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you enjoyed the original trilogy\\, I would suggest that you skip this one. The original characters are basically trashed. The behavior of \\\"Luke\\\" is completely out of character. So much so that Mark Hamill had to play it as if it were another role. The movie is very politically correct and indeed this seems to be the primary focus of the film. I've disliked movies before\\, but this one made me angry and disgusted.","true":true}
