Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think that Star Wars the last Jedi was an ok movie and for what it was trying to do. But it didn't hit a home run\\, my friends and I were really hyped for it and I feel like it just wastes characters and opportunity of the movie. My friends and I came up with endings and different scenarios. I ask myself where were the creative people on this movie. Kinda sad to be honest.","true":true}
