Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson wrote and directed the Skywalker Saga into a predicament. \\n\\nThis film was filled with logic gaps\\, plot holes\\, pacing issues\\, and inconsistencies. Arguably\\, it was longer than it needed to be and the direction to not reshoot key areas of the film and re-evaluate the plot due to the untimely death of Carrie Fischer was\\, dare I say it\\, a misstep. \\n\\nThe tension established by Lawrence Kasdan\\, JJ Abrams\\, and Rick Kerb in the Force Awakens had the audience reeling and bought in. Two years later\\, the questions and mysteries introduced in The Force Awakens were brushed aside\\, I believe\\, in an effort to pad the future for a new trilogy and the result was a disservice to the story of the Skywalker Saga. \\n\\nThe last few times someone (George Lucas) took the reigns for writing and directing a star wars film\\, we know what the world received. And\\, to me\\, this film reeked of the prequels.\\n\\nThe social commentary Rian penned was laughable\\, the jokes were filled with cheap humor\\, and the essence of what makes Star Wars brilliant (character development) was absent for nearly all the characters save for Adam Driver's Kylo Ren.\\n\\nA character's conflict and the work it takes for them to attain a goal is the key to compelling character development. For Rian Johnson to take the characters values (Rey's longing for home\\, Finn's relationship with Rey\\, the budding friendship of Poe and Finn)\\, and brush it aside to introduce hollow characters\\, and the basis for a future trilogy was a tactical mistake.\\n\\nSure there were some iconic scenes but I think most people will look back at the series and recognize that there was more wrong than right in this entry.","true":true}
