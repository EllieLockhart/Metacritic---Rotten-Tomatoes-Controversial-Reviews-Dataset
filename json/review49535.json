Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow... I just... don't really have the words for ths. I was not a fan of The Force Awakens\\, so I waited a while to see this one\\, but I wasn't expecting something THIS BAD. WTF was Disney thinking with this? The Last Jedi is a total dumpster fire of a mess - filled with over the top humor and lame gags\\, preachy political and social commentary\\, and completely lame characters in asisnine situations. I'll say the visuals were impressive and the music was fine (even though it seemed like John Williams just rehashed his entire line up from Empire Strikes Back). \\n\\nAll in all: This was NOT the Star Wars I was looking for. Disney should be ashamed of making such a ridiculous mockery of Star Wars. Wake up Disney! You gave me some hope after Rogue One\\, but this... ??? Sheesh!","true":true}
