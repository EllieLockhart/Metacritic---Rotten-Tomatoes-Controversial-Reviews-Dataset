Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After what I would consider success from the last two installments in the Star Wars universe\\, I was hopeful that would reintroduce Mark Hamill would be up to snuff. Unfortunately\\, this movie was all but a waste of time. Save your money and catch it on the late late movie for free. Hard to believe it wasn't direct to video! The movie seems like a mash up of previous movies and I was bored for the first  hour and a half\\, by the time the last part of the move got interesting it was too late to change my opinion. It is unfortunate that Carrie Fisher's last Star Wars movie was this sad sack. Seems like Disney had a contest and a nine year old won his\/her chance at writing a script.","true":true}
