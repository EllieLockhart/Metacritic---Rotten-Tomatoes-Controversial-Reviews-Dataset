This game is absolutely phenomenal. it's got a controversial story for sure\\, but I loved every bit of it. I don't understand how so many people can be so upset about the direction of the story alone. It's not poorly written. It's every bit as fantastic in it's writing as the first game was. The dialogue\\, the voice and motion capture acting is top notch. The gameplay is engaging and brutal\\, just as I expected. I marvel at the technological advancements of the game\\, they can't be praised enough.\r\rIf you are on the edge on whether you should try the game or not\\, I say give it a shot. I enjoyed every minute of it and I'm already looking forward to whatever Naughty Dog does next.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
