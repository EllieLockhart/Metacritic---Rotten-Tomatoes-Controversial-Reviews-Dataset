Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible. It's as if none of the earlier movies existed. In any movie the heroes are only as good as its villains. And in this case the villains are laughable. Terrible shame how bad the franchise has become.  If JJ Abrams doesn't fix Episode 9 then this franchise may go the way of the Transformers.","true":true}
