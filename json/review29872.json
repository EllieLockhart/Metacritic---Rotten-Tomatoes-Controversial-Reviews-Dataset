Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rogue One was great\\, the writing and comedy lands very well. Weird how we got this after it seemed like we were heading in the right direction\\, I\u2019m conflicted lotta like\/hate for it. If the a lot of what Mark Hamil said was true I agree. Maybe we\u2019ll get a good non-Directors Cut thanks to fans being honest. We\u2019ll see. I\u2019m only excited about side Star Wars productions like Rogue One now. GG","true":true}
