Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really embrace changes\\, reinterpretations and new ideas\\, but it's a stupid idea to put them in the middle part of a trilogy. Johnson should have made one of the spin-off-movies and not Episode VIII. Maybe I would even have enjoyed his childish sense of humor or the way he mocks the audience by making everything meaningless or is bringing something totally unrealistic as Star Wars to the point where it's illogical to the max and really forces you to silence even the slowest of your brain cells. Maybe he should write a new Spaceballs-movie. He obviously has the right ideas.","true":true}
