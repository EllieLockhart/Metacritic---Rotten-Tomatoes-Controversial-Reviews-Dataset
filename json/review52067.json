Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing\\, and liking\\, the force awakens i was really hoping to like the last jedi.  After all\\, luke was returning. and then i saw the movie.  an absolute disgrace. pure sjw jibberish. rose tiko. are you kidding me? to take a series\\, inspiring moment at the end of tfa\\, with so much anticipation built up\\, to turn it into a joke!  I'm furious at you disney. i'm furious at you kennedy.  I'm furious at you johnson.  you have ruined the most beloved franchise in movie history.","true":true}
