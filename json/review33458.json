Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible addition to the Star Wars lore. Everything about this movie was poorly written and directed. Too many unnecessary sub-plots\\, and characters that shouldn't have been in the movie. So many points in the film did not make sense. Disney\\, you have ruined Star Wars.  Your sequel trilogy is turning out to be complete garbage. Do yourself a favor and give back Star Wars back to its' creator\\, Lucas.","true":true}
