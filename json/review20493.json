Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a star wars fan since I was a little kid. I used to watch the original trilogy on repeat on VHS. I then read over 30 of the star wars novels. I say all this to explain that despite my love for the novels\\, I love what they've been doing with these movies. I think they handled Luke Skywalker perfectly based on who he is in the original trilogy. I highly recommend this movie and suggest to watch it with an open mind.","true":true}
