Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Another half attempt at a remake\/ revival leveraging on people nostalagia: story line is very similar to the first trilogy minus the ability to create intrigue and mystery and with no credible bad guy. Really disappointed to say that even phantom menace was more exciting: at least there was an attempt to create something really new and that was a decent built up to what was coming next.","true":true}
