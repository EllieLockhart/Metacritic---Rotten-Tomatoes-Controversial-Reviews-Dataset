Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Huge disappointment. After seeing The Force Awakens I had high hopes for this film. Sadly I was disappointed. To begin with\\, Rian Johnson bastardized the Luke character as well as the force. This isn't a matter of being an \\\"old school\\\" fan\\, it's a matter of the force not lining up with what we know from the previous movies which this movie is a continuation of (including The Force Awakens)! Back to Luke for a second- he creepily drinks the breast milk (I can't call them utters because they resemble female human breasts) from some weird alien creature. It's gross...\\nLeia can apparently fly in the vacuum of space like Superman. \\nAs it turns out Snoke really didn't need to be in this movie or the last one- you get no information on him\\, what happens with him is lame given how powerful they also make him seem. \\n1\/2 the movie is the Star War equilivent of the OJ Simpson slow speed getaway chase. \\nI can go on and on but this is just a bad movie. I see people don't understand how others can give it a low rating\\, but I can't see how they can give it a positive one. Sure\\, there's some great action but that's it. It's scary that Rian Johnson is working on a new trilogy. I will have no interest at all in any Star Wars movies he's directing. He clearly doesn't understand Star Wars.","true":true}
