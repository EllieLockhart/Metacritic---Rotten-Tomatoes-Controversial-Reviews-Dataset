Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The new star wars trilogy is an abomination made by soulless hacks like Abrams and Johnson. The Last Jedi is a further deterioration of a great universe Lucas once created. Johnson's claims that he must tear down the old for Star Wars to grow simply shows his lack of reverence for anything sacred in the story line and his willingness as a lackey for Disney to simply keep the ball of pointless action rolling. The original Star Wars was the 1st film I ever saw. The themes presented in the original trilogy shaped my own morality. This demolition of all that I loved so Disney can go on selling an infinite number of toys and hollow films is ironically a real life example of what the original trilogy warned us all about in the beginning.","true":true}
