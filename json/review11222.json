Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly I thought this is one of the best Star Wars ever made it answered so many questions that need to be answered and after watching the 8th Star Wars before it it made perfect sense and set the story up perfectly to end Star Wars possibly with the 9th movie and continue the next Trilogy with the Old Republic. It end of the Jedi into the Sith for exactly what it said it would it was full of action and I thought I was a lot better than the 7th.","true":true}
