Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A see sawing roller coaster of emotional content\\, the loss\\, the relief\\, the joy and certainly some tears. I've never belly laughed in a Star Wars movie and after 40 yrs it happened. Perfect no\\, good story\\, brilliant dialogue\\,  yes. Seen it twice\\, will be going back again","true":true}
