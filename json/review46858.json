Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well this movie was absolute trash\\, apart from a few interesting scenes and some nice visuals it did not live up to the hype. The pacing of the movie suffers as it feels more like an assortment of prolonged scenes that are randomly strung together. Not only that but the auxiliary characters of Finn and Rose are ridiculously boring to watch on screen and given very little to do that actually advances the plot\\, beyond a MacGuffin involving Benicio del Toro's one dimensional version of a scoundrel. Who was Snoke...apparently a character created as a placeholder with no tangible ties to past events as at this point referencing the prequels is apparently worse than making a terrible Star Wars movie. In reference to Luke the real last Jedi\\, I only know one thing these Disney movies have to end!","true":true}
