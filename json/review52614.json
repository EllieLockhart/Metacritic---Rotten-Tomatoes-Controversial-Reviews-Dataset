Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All I can say about this movie is that it was wasted potential. The biggest quarrel I had with it was that two of the biggest questions from the force awakens (who is Snoke and who are Rey\u2019s parents) are made obsolete in this movie and the answers to them are almost as lazy as the ending of rogue one. Combine this with the unnecessary length of the movie\\, a new useless character in Rose to go along with Finns uselessness\\, Poe becoming obsolete\\, and the writers ruining how we view the force\\, and this movie is just a big disappointment from the hype it got","true":true}
