Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow... the bulk of the critic ratings are from the premier in which they don't want to dog the movie so they keep getting invited to Disney Premiers. Don't believe them. What a absolutely horrible direction to take this movie series. The validity of the original trilogy and even the prequels is greatly diminished by this movie. Shame on you Disney and Rian Johnson. Absolutely terrible. There were definitely some positives about this movie so I gave it 1.5 stars\\, but wow am I disappointed as a big Star Wars fan.","true":true}
