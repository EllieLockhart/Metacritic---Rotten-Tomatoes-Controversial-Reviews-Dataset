Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a good movie to just kill time my main issues is that the movie felt a lot like a marvel movie   to me. another issue is that i did not understand how she got so far with no training but that will diffrent till i read why she is it was the laziest writing i have seen in a movie and kill the main villain and now there is no threat to the galaxy and then now that rey and kylo are the only ones left kind kills the story. just didn't feel like a star wars movie just feel disappointed in Disney and what they did to the series","true":true}
