Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This entire movie is this is a kneejerk reaction to \\\"toxic masculinity\\\"\\, \\\"mansplaining\\\"\\, \\\"the wage gap\\\"\\, and \\\"the patriarchy\\\".\\n \\nSo instead of having strong female characters along side of the male characters like in previous Star Wars movies\\, the ENTIRE STORY is about how incompetent\\, fragile\\, and weak men are. Basically the only hope for a better \\\"galaxy\\\" is if women lead the revolution.\\n\\nAlso **SPOILERS** They decided to make Chewbacca a vegan now.","true":true}
