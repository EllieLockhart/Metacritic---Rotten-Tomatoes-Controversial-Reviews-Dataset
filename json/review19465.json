Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's the first time that I was disappointed with a star wars movie. There are so many plotholes and so many forced jokes. It's really sad. Trying to make everything unexpected doesn't mean it's original and doesn't necessarily make your movie good. I cringed so many times while watching this movie\\, my neck almost broke. And the social justice crap disney doesn't fit !!!","true":true}
