Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"https:\/\/l.facebook.com\/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fsknr.net%2F2017%2F12%2F12%2Fstar-wars-last-jedi%2F&h=ATOgAYVjZGsXI43e5uVW1G6uJVdteo8cmGxUkZG75RTKUu0m1wHH56zIaWKpUCkzKkgKz971h8f2DOiYKWpTPGv3ol_DGxsPfijoEHRwHFCkdX5ZI-JLHkboaBC2nyZkryCoi7GUAA0\\\"\\n\\n \\\"Star Wars\\\": The Last Jedi\\\" is the film that fans have been waiting for as it contains all of the best elements of Star Wars and boldly moves the franchise ahead.","true":true}
