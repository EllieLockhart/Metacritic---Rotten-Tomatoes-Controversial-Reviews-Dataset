Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie completely surprised me. When I walked in I thought I knew what I was getting. I knew what the questions were and the only mystery was how they would be answered. About 2\/3 through the movie\\, the entire Star Wars universe changed for me. I didn't know what the questions were\\, let alone the answers. It was amazing.\\n\\nThe sense of humor in this movie is much drier than previous Star Wars movies\\, and that really worked for me.\\nAlso\\, this movie also wrestles with questions of legacy that is a little meta\\, but very welcome.","true":true}
