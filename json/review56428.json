Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The biggest let down of my life. The film was full of inconsistencies from TFA. Major plot holes were created and massive reveals were were tossed aside for no reason. The way Luke was handled was disrespectful to the franchise and completely broke the immersion of the film. I often found myself questioning the team's decisions regarding so many aspects of the film. We were promised the darkest Star Wars yet\\, however the film failed to kill off characters that really needed to be removed like Rose\\, Finn and Leia. This movie has made Attack Of the Clones look like a masterpiece.","true":true}
