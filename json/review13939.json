Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you come to this film expecting something similar to the previous movies\\, then you will be sadly disappointed. The problem with this movie is that there is not prequel that sets this movie up for its much acclaimed anticipation. I believe that is the reasoning behind the negative reviews for this film. If you look at it with an open mind to a story that sets the tone for a whole new generation of Jedi\u2019s and Sith Lords\\, then you will enjoy this movie as part of a legacy that has gone through generations of fans. Great movie. Great concept. Great story.","true":true}
