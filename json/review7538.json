Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"EVERYONE NEEDS TO CHILL OUT AND WAKE UP. This movie was REALLY good. It was a great film\\, critically speaking\\, and it was a great Star Wars movie\\, from a true fan\u2019s perspective. The visuals were SPECTACULAR. Every shot could be viewed as a work of art. Skellig Michael was the perfect location for Luke\u2019s hermit home. Snoke\u2019s throne room was beautifully intimidating. Cantonica was a luxuriously breathtaking casino planet. Every starship battle in space was far more intriguing and visually pleasing than any other battle in any other movie. The use of the Force in this movie was significantly more interesting and powerful than previous movies. The character development of the mainstays was very much welcomed\\, and the introduction of several new characters did not disappoint. Do yourself a favor: see this epic movie and give it the honest 5-star review that it deserves. Please don\u2019t listen to the haters and trolls. They\u2019re the ones who think that Jar Jar Binks was a good character. JAR JAR BINKS. Are you kidding me?! ","true":true}
