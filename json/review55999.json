Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Second in a trilogy of movies which seem intent on making the  6 which came before irrelevant\\, the Last Jedi seems to be an attempt at simultaneously slapping JJ Abrams\\, frustrating fan plot predictions through cheap and jarring directional changes\\, and shoving agendas so far down the viewers throat that the movie can be considered a meal substitute. Worst of all is that the agenda pushing comes at the expense of the character integrity of the heroes from the first 6 movies. Characters like Luke seem to have suffered from personality changing traumatic brain injuries such that our determined (to the point of converting Vadar on his death bed)\\, master duelist\\,  jedi master has become a cowardly hermit so unskilled as to be beaten by someone who has a couple days self training with a lightsaber\\, and is willing to murder his apprentice at the first sign of temptation. This is just one example. As if such blatant disregard for the foundation of the story this movie supposedly builds on is not ugly enough\\, the plot of this film is exasperatingly full of plot holes. The special effects and visuals are nice though.","true":true}
