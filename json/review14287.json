Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I good movie\\, but not a good Star Wars movie.  The whole 9 episode arc was supposed to be about the rise\\, the fall\\, and the redemption of the Skywalkers.  This movie just throws that idea under the bus and runs over it a couple times.  Then burns the remains and stuffs the ashes in the nearest street dumpster.\\n\\nNow\\, it is well made and looks very good\\, but the story and plot don't fit here.  It isn't Episode VIII.  It isn't the Skywalker story.  The whole thing could easily just be summed up in the opening crawl to Episode VIII.\\n\\nThey've angered and stepped on too many fans here.  I don't know what they'll do for IX.  It makes you long for the days when you sat in a cozy nook reading the Timothy Zahn trilogy.  Where's Thrawn and Mara Jade when you need them!","true":true}
