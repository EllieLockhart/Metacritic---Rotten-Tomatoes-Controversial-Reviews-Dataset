Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was not Rian Johnson's fault. Kathleen Kennedy was the one whoo has chosen him.   He was acting as he is\\, a good director\\, not for Star Wars. \\nIt is like if I would like to put Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo training dribbling with a ball in the movie: Some people(as crazy as it may seem)\\, who love football\\, would like it. But it wouldn't be good\\, because Star Wars is not the place for them to appear. \\nYou can innovate the mood of a narrative you create\\, but you should not take your friends to a bad sorrowful poetry show\\, just because you like it\\, and want to prank them.","true":true}
