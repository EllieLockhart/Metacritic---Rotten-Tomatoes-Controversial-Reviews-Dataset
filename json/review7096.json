Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Empire finds rebel base and wipes it out. Force user goes to distant planet to train with old Jedi master. Empire chases rebel ship through space at a safe distance. Force user student leaves before she completes her training to deal with dark force user. Rebels stumble across some dude who promise to help them but then sells them out to the empire. Student deals with dark side user and barely escapes with her life. Rebels also manage to escape and are now on the run again.","true":true}
