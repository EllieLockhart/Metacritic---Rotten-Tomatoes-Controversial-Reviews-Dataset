Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi. So much potential. So much disappointment. The Anakin Skywalker of this trilogy.\\n\\nThe Good:\\n\\nThe movie had many beautiful shots throughout. The aesthetics for a number of scenes were spot on\\, especially with the battle scenes. To date\\, TLJ has one of the best fight scenes in the entire franchise. I give the movie kudos for taking the risk to venture out and do its own thing\\, unlike TWA where the studio played it safe. Lastly\\, Adam Driver gave his best performance yet\\, which is a big step up from his character in TWA.\\n\\nThe Bad:\\n\\nUnfortunately\\, the risks backfired due to poor execution\\, leaving the movie's plot structure\\, length\\, and pace a total mess. Unbalanced character development\\, the killing off of notable characters\\, the introduction of throwaway characters\\, nonsensical decision-making by these characters\\, unnecessary cameos\\, complete deviations of character portrayal from previous film\\, 30 minute side stories that do nothing for the main story's progression\\, unwanted social commentary\\, weak and awkward comedic injections\\, a continuation of a Mary Sue character which hindered the previous film\\, gaping plot holes\\, the list goes on and on if I were to include actual spoilers. This movie tried so hard to diverge from J.J. Abram's piece it actually did what it set out to not do; many elements from Episode IV and V can be seen\\, so in reality this is just more of the same. Many potential storylines\\, let alone continuations of actual events that were set up by TWA\\, were tossed down the drain for the sake of poorly executed originality. By the end of the movie\\, the First Order was still all-powerful\\, the Resistance still weak and unorganized as ever\\, and the magic and nostalgia of Star Wars a little dimmer. \\n\t\\nOverall\\, this movie was a bundle of disappointment. I wanted to like this movie so badly\\, but the more I and many other viewers recollect on this film\\, the more sour our opinions turn. I don't know what is the heads of these film critics to give this movie so many glowing reviews and catapulting it over 90%. The audience is right in this case\\, and it deserves every little bit of its ~50% rating. Riveting visuals can only take the movie so far\\, and it falls short this time. J.J. Abrams\\, you are once again placed in a position of doubt and uncertainty to deliver after huge disappointment. But this time\\, you come with a notch already on your belt.","true":true}
