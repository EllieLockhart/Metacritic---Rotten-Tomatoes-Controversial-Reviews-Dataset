Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"...\\nTHis truly was a massive spectacular way... to ruin the future of star wars. I really am DISAPPOINTED in the terrible plot\\, character design and... well everything really.\\n\\nFirst time I've seen a star wars film only once in the theatres. Usually see at least 2 or more times. And I refuse to even buy or seen this rubbish again.","true":true}
