Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars at it's finest! \\nThis latest instalment carries Star Wars to new heights and propels it into new directions in the Star Wars Universe. The story is a rollercoaster of emotions\\, with unpredictable turns around every corner. There is no mimicry of past Star Wars films\\, and I have a good feeling this film will hold it's replay value. Obviously there are certain characters that hold the fort\\, however not one of them steal the show. The film quickly travels where you want it to and answers\\, whilst creating a plethora of new\\, questions for you as a viewer. I cannot express the master craft that this film is.   Matching the unrelenting force of what was the Empire Strikes Back\\, the Last Jedi easily sits on it's own\\, high pedestal.","true":true}
