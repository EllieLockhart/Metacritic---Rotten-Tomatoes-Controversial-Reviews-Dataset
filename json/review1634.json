Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lover of the Star Wars franchise I have to say this is the weakest film BY FAR (yes\\, I'd prefer to sit down to another viewing of Episode One than see this again). The film is dogged by terrible pacing as the director attempts to super-impose a bizarre\\, non-threatening chase narrative over a series of virtually unconnected set-pieces\\, some of which further plot but many just wasting the audiences time. \\n\\nThe directors lack of experience with a film of this budget unfortunately shows alongside a clear case of too many cooks in the kitchen. Disappointing.","true":true}
