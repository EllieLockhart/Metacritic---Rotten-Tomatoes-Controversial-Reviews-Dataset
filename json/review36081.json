Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi walks a fine line: it departs from previously established Star Wars norms and plots in a big way\\, but expands upon the characters from 2015\u2019s The Force Awakens and plays host to Luke Skywalker\u2019s much anticipated return to the silver screen. In most ways\\, this film succeeds. Mark Hamill\u2019s return is triumphant. The message and themes from the movie stick with you after viewing\\, something you can\u2019t say of most wide-audience movies being released in 2017. And while The Last Jedi has the occasional echo from previous Star Wars entries\\, it feels like the most unique release in the series since 1980\u2019s Empire Strikes Back. However\\, some of the risks taken in this film don\u2019t pay off. The long runtime doesn\u2019t feel justified\\, several attempts at humor fall flat\\, certain scenes feel entirely out of place for this universe\\, and John Boyega and Kelly Marie Tran\u2019s characters spend a significant portion of the movie in a plot line that feels poorly paced and provides little pay-off. But at the end of the day\\, The Last Jedi gives the Star Wars universe a much needed injection of originality\\, and where it succeeds as a film it provides some of the most memorable moments in the series to date. The flaws in the movie occasionally distract from the rest of the experience but never subsume what it gets right.","true":true}
