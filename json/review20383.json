Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I understand hard core fans like to pick apart plots and all aspects of Star Wars\\, and they get enjoyment from that part of the experience just like others of us love watching the movie and accepting small flaws as part of the intergalactic ride. As a fan since 1978\\, I loved this movie. The Last Jedi exceeded all my expectations. ","true":true}
