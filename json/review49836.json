Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"yes\\, this movie sucks and is a disgrace.    I am more interested in rt's frozen \\\"47%\\\"; rating - I have been monitoring the review feed for some months now and am convinced with high confidence this score is simply rigged.  When will it tick down to 46%\\, you ask?  The answer is never - your reviews do not count here.  Look for yourself - page after page of terrible reviews\\, yet somehow we are supposed to believe the stats are roughly 1:1 \\\"fresh\\\" to \\\"rotten?\\\"  Here is why. this movie's enigmatic critic score\\, far greater than the audience score\\, represents a bona fide enterprise risk for rt's business model.  everyone expects the critic score < audience score because the audience self-selects\\, and no one complains if they are pleasantly surprised.  but having the phenom go the other way sheds a nasty light on how beholden critics are to disney as a massive corporation\\, their herding behavior\\, and thus the lack of a fidelitous relationship b\/n the aggregated critics' score and audience enjoyment.  which is to say\\, this sheds an embarrassing light on rt's value-added for consumers\\, and audience scores have been thus frozen at 47% (should be 20-25% based off available sampling). https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CWPAbKEmd5M\\n   All the talk about \\\"half stars\\\" not counting is not true; they have frozen the score to stop further\\, embarassing bad press of this issue.","true":true}
