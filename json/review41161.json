Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has everything that you could ever not want. The plot holes within it are frustrating at best. The pacing left it feeling longer than BvS. The only logic I can produce for many choices of characters is PiS (plot induced stupidity). On the subject of the plot\\, it also is a flawed. I would rate it a little higher\\, but for now it is the only movie that has made me audibly groan in theaters and was bad enough to make me quit on a franchise I was invested in. If some other movie manages this I will consider moving up the rating.","true":true}
