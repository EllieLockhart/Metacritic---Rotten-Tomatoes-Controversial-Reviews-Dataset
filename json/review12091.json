Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a HUGE Star Wars fan and was very hyped for this movie. Though it did have a few issues and minor plot holes it did justice to the saga. As for characters\\, some were amazing in TLJ and some were pointless. Overall I loved this movie and without spoiling it had great plot twists and some great story arcs. The special effects and music were beautifully done as always and most performances were also great","true":true}
