Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILER ALERT!!! I wanted to like this movie but I found myself saying \u201cwtf\u201d and just getting frustrated with all the characters and their horrible decisions costing everyone to die. There weren\u2019t any exciting moments\\, just a lot of let downs and repetitiveness. The character\\, Poe\\, is so careless\\, wreckless\\, and caused everyone to die with his stupid decisions to go against the admiral. If only the admiral had told Poe the plan\\, they could of saved so many lives. So many bad one liners\\, bad screenplay\\, bad directing\\, bad sound mixing\\, bad cinematography\\, bad fight scenes\\, and bad everything. I hope they can make a better Star Wars movie in the future. 1\/5 star for me. ","true":true}
