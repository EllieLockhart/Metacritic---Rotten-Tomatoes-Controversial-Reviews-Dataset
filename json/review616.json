The other thing I wasn't impressed by was its replay value\\, the developers had sad that most people will only get 50% of the experience the first time through and will imidiately want to play it again\\, without spoiling anything\\, this is simply not the case\\, even though there is reason to replay the game\\, it is not for that reason. that's really everything bad about the game\\, everything else is great\\, but one thing that really surprised me was the depth of the characters and how much I actually ended up liking them. this is a great game for those who are into games where your choices matter and those who also love horror clich\u00e9s because this game embraces them in the best way possible.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
