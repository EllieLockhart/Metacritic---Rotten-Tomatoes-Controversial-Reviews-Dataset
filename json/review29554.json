Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson masterfully toys with audience expectations to create the freshest\\, most surprising Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back.  The core of the film is the unstated\\, impossible\\, but palpable romance between Rey and Kylo--all his motivations become clear\\, as one friend remarked to me\\, when you understand that he wants to get some.  This isn't a perfect film (the attempts at humor sometimes fall flat\\, for instance)\\, but it's one of the best Star Wars films\\, which makes it a must see to any fan--I've seen it twice\\, and would have seen it at least twice more by now if my schedule permitted.","true":true}
