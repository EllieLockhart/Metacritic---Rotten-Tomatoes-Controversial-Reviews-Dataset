Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This franchise deserved better.\\n\\nAt certain points in the film\\, I felt like I was watching The Fosters\\, but in space.   You know\\, the episode where Jesus or Carlos or whoever has a disagreement with his two mommies. Except in this episode\\, his mommies are hateful and vindictive and beat the sh**t  out of him\\, and then purple hair mommy needlessly offs herself. (As Leia watches purple hairs burnt and mangled body  cartwheeling into oblivion - \\\" do you think we should have told her about the auto pilot?\\\").\\n\\n  That about sums it up.","true":true}
