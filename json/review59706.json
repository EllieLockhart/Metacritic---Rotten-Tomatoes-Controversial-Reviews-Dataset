We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"They did Joel  dirty in this game\r\r1)  \\\"They were actually going to make a cure\\\"\r\rOne of the very first things 's says is in the game is extremely problematic.  People justify their own actions.  They choose to interpret events\\, especially uncertain events\\, in a way that is favorable to them.  If you go to a prison\\, every single person will claim innocent.  This is practically a fundamental truth.\r\rThere is no way to know for sure what the fireflies chance of finding a cure were.  So it is something people are free to Interpret how they want.  Here are two examples:\r\r(A)  0% chance of cure:   is a hero who saved  from dying a pointless death.  The surgeon is a monster who was willing to sacrifice an innocent girl for a 1 in a million chance for a cure.   has NO reason to hate .\r\r(B) 100% chance of cure:   is a monster who robbed humanity of a cure.  The surgeon is a hero who died trying to save humanity.   has a reason to hate  forever.\r\rWhich way do you think  and  would chose to interpret things?  It makes sense for  to believe \\\"truth\\\" B.  Of course she would rather think of her father as a hero rather than a monster.  Similarly\\,  would believe \\\"truth\\\" A where he is a hero.  He would never choose to believe in a Interpretation that would give  a reason to hate him.\r\rThe beginning of the game should have been like this:\r\r\\\"It was a shot in the dark.  One in the million chance for a cure.  Everything I had seen suggested as much.  The speed they decided to sacrifice the 's only immune.  Not even trying to get 's approval.  The incompetence I had seen across the country...  I couldn't stand the idea of  dying for nothing.  So I killed them all.\\\"\r\r-----\r\rHowever\\, Neil gave  a lobotomy and had him say\\, \\\"They were actually going to make a cure\\\"\r\r2)  the most important moment of part one is undone in part two.\r\rAt the end of first game\\,  asks  a question.   lies.  He doesn't tell  the truth that will make her hate him.\r\rIn part two\\, the exact same scenario plays out again.    asks  about what really happened at the hospital.  This time  tells  the \\\"truth\\\" and makes her hate him.   There was nothing preventing him from giving a version of events that was favorable to him (0% chance of cure).  This directly contradicts the end of the first game.\r\r-----\r\rNeil gave  a lobotomy and forced him to believe 's \\\"truth\\\".  Neil then game him another lobotomy to force him to tell that \\\"truth\\\" to .  In the end\\,  hates  for something that he himself told her.   This is unbelievable.\r\rThey did  dirty in this game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
