Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pretty standard sci fi film. It was disappointing to see Abrams ideas go unanswered or be completely thrown away. But despite that we are still left with a pretty good film. The cast is great and excels better here than in The Force Awakens if I'm being honest. The bad parts involve the casino scenes\\, or the parts revolving the animals. They were dragged out and really halted the flow of the film overall. I thought Luke's storyline was good and Rey worked well with him\\, the ending with him was sorta a waste but it's fine. Kyle Ren is still an inadequate \\\"villain\\\" and is void of any real personality. Snoke is wasted\\, but his battle scene in the red room with Rey and Kylo was phenomenal and showed a section of how amazing film could have been.","true":true}
