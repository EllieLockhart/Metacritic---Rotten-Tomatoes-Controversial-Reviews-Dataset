Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ takes risks with characters and plot that are unexpected yet fitting to the Star Wars universe. There are elements that pay homage to the OT while still driving the story in new and exciting ways. Mark Hamill gives a stellar performance and Carrie's is a fitting farewell. There's darkness and levity to the film\\, and - aside from some misplaced humor - this film is Star Wars\\, through and through\\, and I can't wait to see it again.","true":true}
