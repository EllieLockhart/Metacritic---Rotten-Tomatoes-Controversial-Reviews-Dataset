Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Numerous plot holes\\, inconsistencies\\, lack of any logic and terrible humor contrasted unskillfully with overly saturated drama renders this film a slap on the face for Star Wars fans and an unbearable experience for any viewer who expects a bit more than mindless visuals.","true":true}
