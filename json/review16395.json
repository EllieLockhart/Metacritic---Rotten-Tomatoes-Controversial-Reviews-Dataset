Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm really sad to say the movie is a disappointment.  A once great franchise\\, has been swallowed up by a money making  machine(Disney).     The effect being a disjointed story that at times insults our intelligence\\, old heroes being torn down and replaced by new heroes we don't care about it\\, and a movie that pimps out characters for the purpose of being action figures (porgs\\, Bad bb-8\\, phasma\\, etc.. )\\n\\nStar Wars is dead.","true":true}
