Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In The Force Awakens\\, Han angrily tells Finn\\, \\\"That's not how the Force works.\\\" After watching The Last Jedi\\, I found myself similarly flabbergasted. Mary Poppins Leia\\, BB-8 slot coin machine gun and a Luke Skywalker who is more interested in showing Rey how he milks aliens than listening to her on why his own sister needs help from the son he helped drive to the dark side. When Obi Wan went into hiding it was for the purpose of one day training Luke to fox the mistakes he had been a part of. Luke went into hiding to allow those mistakes to fester into a new empire that is killing all those he loves. What a waste of a story.","true":true}
