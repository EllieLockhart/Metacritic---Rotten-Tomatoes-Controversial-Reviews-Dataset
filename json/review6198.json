Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney has finally done it. We have been left with a dumbed down version of Star Wars rife with \\\"forced humor\\\" and nonsensical filler. \\nThe Last Jedi not only completely missed the tone of what Star Wars is\\,  it butchered it. This new generation of movies are clearly being made for monetization of products rather than to tell a clear cohesive story with world (galaxy) building and purpose. \\n\\nI'm glad I paid $15 to watch Rian mock Star Wars fans and kill the character development George Lucas made in his original trilogy. Hopefully J.J. can right this ship and salvage what Rian has torn asunder.","true":true}
