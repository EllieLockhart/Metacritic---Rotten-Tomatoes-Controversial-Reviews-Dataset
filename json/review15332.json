Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019ll give it 1 star out of respect for the Star Wars franchise...which is more respect then Johnson gave Luke Skywalker. Just a horrible movie on many levels. There are numerous points in this movie that made no sense. The Rose\/Fin adventure was completely pointless. Phasma was useless. Purple hair girl was a terrible leader. Rebels made one bad decision after another and this movie destroyed the entire point of Episodes 4-6. Not to mention the pacing was just bad...really bad.","true":true}
