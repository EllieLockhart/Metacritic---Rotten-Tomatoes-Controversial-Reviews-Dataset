Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Giving two stars for the genuine drama\\, awe\\, and approach that Rian Johnson imbued this movie with. Taling away three stars for the last five minutes which not only undid all the good in this film but put the story down a hole from which I can't really help it.","true":true}
