Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie dragged in my opinion. There was so much buildup and in my opinion in the end it did not deliver. I think I went in with too many expectations. I did appreciate the foreshadowing of a new generation of Jedi's and future films. I hope the films in the future are much better than this one and more action-packed.","true":true}
