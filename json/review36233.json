Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi? What? I mean I\u2019d say Luke wasn\u2019t even a Jedi he was trained by yoda but that doesn\u2019t make him or Rey a Jedi. Being a Jedi meant that you followed all the rules and you did all of what the Jedi council says. Luke wasn\u2019t a Jedi because he didn\u2019t follow every rule for goodness sake he force chokes someone not a jedi power and Rey don\u2019t even get me started she probably doesn\u2019t even know the first thing about being a Jedi heck in the last movie she didn\u2019t even believe in the force.","true":true}
