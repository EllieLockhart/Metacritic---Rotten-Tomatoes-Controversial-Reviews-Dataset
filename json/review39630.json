Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This has to be the biggest disappointment in Star Wars. Yes more disappointing than the Phantom Menace. The Last Jedi had issues with the comedy\/humor. Yes the Force Awakens did have comedy\/humor\\, but it was done right. Did we really need to see Kyle Ren shirtless so Rey can add a pun or joke. The seriousness of that scene was taken away from another terrible pun\/joke and it just left me shaking my head no. The tone of the film is what makes the movie fail for me. I could write you a 10 page term paper on how the Last Jedi failed\\, but the semester just ended so\\, no. Lastly if you made it this far in my movie review and felt annoyed\\, I'm glad you know how I felt after 2 hours of sitting through the Last Jedi....","true":true}
