In addition to how they are oddly contradicting the points that true fans complain about: the characters (Abby mainly) when there is a comment saying how we hate their poor introduction\\, their story and development\\, there are 4 or 5 more saying that they love the characters\\, when we complain about how the story mocks and spits in the face of the first game\\, they all shield themselves with the cheap excuse of: \\\"If you don't like this game\\, it's because you're homophobic\\\"\rI\u00b4m pretty sure all of us who played and loved the first game never cared that Elie was gay. On the contrary\\, I loved the character\\, but no\\, they had to play that dirty card\\, blaming the community for being intolerant\\, just because the game was influenced by a person (I'm not going to say her name but I think everyone already knows who she is) who ruined the story just for wanting to put a progressive psychology in our brains\\, something that was very useless by the way\\, since the points where they try to be inclusive and make us understand the characters fail so brutally that nothing matters and makes us think that this script was written by a monkey on a desk.\rA very bad game\\, a very bad introduction\\, message\\, story and character development\\, but\\, above all\\, a very bad treatment not only for the fans\\, but also for the workers who suffered terrible working conditions for nothing. The game\u00b4s tittle is \\\"The Last of Us\\\"\\, I think it fits perfectly\\, because I hope that this game will be \\\"The Last of Them\\\"\u2026 Expand","true":true}
