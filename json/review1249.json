Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Approaching this movie from a fan's perspective\\, it is absolutely awful. The film killed\\, both metaphorically and literally\\, our childhood hero. Its character arcs either amounted to nothing or were illogical. I could go on for hours\\, but I'll leave this at the murder of Luke Skywalker. \\n\\nFrom that of an objective moviegoer\\, the numerous plot holes\\, conflicts in tone with scene\\, poorly-developed character arcs\\, inappropriate interactions among characters\\, and disastrous gaps in continuity ruined this film. I have absolutely no idea how critics who are actually paid to critique movies can possibly approve of this cinematic trash. \\n\\nSorry\\, Mark Hammill. I'm just so sorry.","true":true}
