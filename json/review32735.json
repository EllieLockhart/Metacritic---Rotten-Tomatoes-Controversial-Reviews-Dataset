Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars - The Last Jedi Review\\n\\nHonestly\\, probably spoilers\\, no idea\\, haven't written it yet.\\n\\nOk\\, so we saw TLJ last night. I was taken back for a moment to my 7th birthday watching the original Star Wars in Omaha NB. Heck\\, it was in the movie theaters for over a year\\, so I think even at that age I saw it 7-8 times.\\n\\nI was taken back to those dark ages when The Star Wars Trilogy was just that.. We didn't have things like the MCU or DCU\\, sequels were still new and Star Wars stood alone as something special.\\n\\nBut now\\, the SWU is just another property to be treated like sausage...just one link after another being ground out from ILM and Disney...Can you tell I'm not thrilled?\\n\\nOk\\, going to work backwards. The rebel fleet is down to one cruiser and a few support ships? That's all? No massive rebel alliance fighting against the evil empire? And that Evil Empire is down to a dreadnought class behemoth that can be destroyed with one tiny bomber load and an X-Wing blowing up some surface turrets? All I can guess is that after losing 2 death stars and a planet base\\, the Empire is more or less broke and couldn't borrow any more money from the Hutt Clan for another fleet of big guns....Disappointing. It all boils down to a command shuttle and a doze or so AtAt walkers against some mine for the Empire and the Rebels all fit on the Millennium Falcon?\\n\\nSorry folks\\, but if we're to believe this...there is a whole big universe of people getting along with their daily lives really not caring about either the Empire or the Rebel Alliance and likely making a good living as a moisture farmer or Expert Pod Racer some place.\\n\\nWhere is the grand scale? The massive industrial cities? It just feels like this whole episode fit into a fanny pack on the belt of some insignificant tourist...\\n\\nAnd\\, I'm all for equality\\, but since when did the rebel council all turn into women wearing Grecian togas? Give me Jen Urso in her battle gear from Rouge One. Give me Bad Ass women in charge and ready to head into battle...Not Carrie Fisher and Laura Dern heading up to the Oracle or floating back into an airlock from empty space.\\n\\nI thought back to the originals...with planet and system killing destroying machines...One blast and entire civilizations were vaporized... and compare that to Snokes threat that he's going to kill Reyn and go down and blow up the \\\"Whole Island\\\" where Luke is. Ok... yeah..I'm scared...the WHOLE ISLAND?\\n\\nI get and understand that they are clearing the decks for new characters and story lines. But the smallness of this episode leaves me feeling that the universe is doing just fine\\, that for most folks they get along day to day without much of a care for the rebels or the empire...and that really what are we fighting for after all.\\n\\nBring back the grandeur and scale\\, or let's allow ILM to come up with something new and different to amaze us all. Let's put Star Wars to bed and move on to something else...\\n\\nThat's my 2 bits...for what its worth.","true":true}
