Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a fan of the old Star Wars films\\, I have wanted to love the recent episodes put out by Disney\\, but have been sorely disappointed each time. The Last Jedi is no exception: a loosely developed plot with lots of jumping back and forth paired with at least an hour too long of screen time made for a waste of my time and money. I am sad to say that I am giving up on investing time into future releases.","true":true}
