Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From Leia bring a popsicle and floating through the air...  to the added things the force could do...  and Luke's change of appearance on the salt planet\\, and ultimately his death...  this film was terrible. This family of 4 thinks this was the worst Star Wars story ever told. The reviews are wrong.","true":true}
