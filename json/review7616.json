Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everything I want to say about this movie has been said a thousand fold. Why this generation hates the original films\\, I have no idea. Because they can't be topped? For me Rogue One was on par with ROTJ as the 3rd best in the saga. Very close indeed. You CAN make a sequel to a classic of old without destroying it's legacy & still be a good film. Watch rogue one or blade runner 2049 or creed. All were good\\, paid homage to the classic movie it was a part of & didn't destroy it's legacy & alienate fans.\\nBesides the obvious franchise killing decisions of this movie\\, where were the droids? Aliens from the sw universe? Force awakens didn't have them either. Twi'leks? Rodians? Saw twi'leks in rogue one. This movie was a joke & good luck getting people to see episode 9","true":true}
