Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was disappointed and cheated. Forty years of themes wiped away and ties cut to the previous movies to extend the life of the franchise with new actors and make more money. The levity was lame\\, Snoke underdeveloped\\, and a suddenly overpowering and commonplace Force unconvincing (why bother with light sabers?). My advise - watch it on a big screen TV at home when nothing else is on worth watching","true":true}
