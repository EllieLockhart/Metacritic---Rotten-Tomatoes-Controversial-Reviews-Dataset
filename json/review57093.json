Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a decent adventure\/action film (a bit light on the action) but as a Star Wars film\\, this is a larger disconnect from the soul of its fan-base than the prequels\\, which is an incredible achievement. \\n\\nThis really shouldn't be necessary as a qualifier\\, but I'm a lefty\\,  bleeding heart\\,  progressive pansy\\,  and I still hate this movie. I only mention this as there seems to be an unforgivable accusatory tone levelled at anyone who criticises this movie as an attempt to undermine the first central female protagonist in the Saga. If you're intellectually honest\\, said protagonist deserved a better script without key information omitted and unforgivable logical inconsistencies that just drag you out of this world. \\n\\nThis is enough to check me out of this universe. It was a delight to have Rogue One produced in this new wave of Disney films. But\\,  for me\\,  this is as far as I can go. \\n\\nIf anyone harbours any hope for Episode 9\\, take little comfort in the fact that it's writer\\, Chris Terrio\\, comes hot off of the heels of such cinematic masterpieces an BvS and Justice League. Wouldn't you just love to be a fly on the wall when these things are decided.","true":true}
