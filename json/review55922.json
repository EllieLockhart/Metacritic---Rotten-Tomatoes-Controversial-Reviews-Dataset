Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson did nothing but prove that A) he has never actually seen and comprehended a Star Wars movie in his life\\, B) he jacks off to Kylo Ren\\, and C) he doesn't care about people of color with this shitfest of a film. \\n\\nNot only does he unnecessarily drag on the already done plotline around if Kylo can be redeemed (spoiler: he can't. You know\\, like JJ told us)\\, he also sidelines Finn\\, who was previously the male lead\\, and puts him on what is in the end a pointless mission. \\n\\nFurthermore\\, Rian BUTCHERS the already existing characters (most notably Luke who is a good fucking person who never would have tried to kill his nephew\\, seriously\\, that contradicts the entirety of his prior characterization) to further Kylo's white man pain.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi is not Rey's story\\, it is not Finn's story\\, it is not Leia or Luke's story\\, it's barely even a sequel to The Force Awakens. It completely butchers the last installment in the franchise (as well as pretty much every other Star Wars movie and spin off) to make it into a story about \\\"humanizing\\\" Kylo\\, who has murdered THOUSANDS of people and who is willingly a part of an organization that parallels Nazis because maybe Han and Leia didn't buy him enough toys.\\n\\nEven outside of that and the way the film abuses Finn for laughs\\, makes Poe into a racist Latino stereotype\\, and uses Rose as little more than a tool for Rian to hurt Finn is disgusting for fans of color to have to watch. It's honestly sad for me to think that Rian really disrespected not only the characters but the actors who play them that awfully and even if the storyline had been cohesive\\, the jokes had been funny\\, and the characters hadn't been so aggressively OOC\\, the blatant racism of the script would still make this movie awful. A movie that doesn't care about its characters of color is bad. End of story.","true":true}
