Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its a great movie as long as your not looking for a starwars movie. Visually beautiful but doesn't understand the material in a way conistent with orevious 7 chapters. You dont change the contect in act 3 of a move and expect the audience to feel good leaving it\\,","true":true}
