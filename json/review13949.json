Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you don't know anything about the Star Wars franchise or don't really care then you will probably enjoy this movie.  However\\, this movie is an absolute disgrace when it comes to being a Star Wars film.  Poor character development\\, abundant plot holes\\, and corny jokes are rampant in this movie. Disney has done an amazing job at ruining a franchise I love.  The Last Jedi is literally the worst Star Wars movie I've ever seen.","true":true}
