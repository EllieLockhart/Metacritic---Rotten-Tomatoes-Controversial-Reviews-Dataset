Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Completely out of character for Luke and Leia. Luke has never been a whiny coward afraid to protect those he loves. Just wrong! Lots of different plots and loose ends everywhere like the most powerful Sith in the galaxy randomly getting killed. Best scene in the movie was the last 3 minutes when a little orphan boy working in a stable reaches out for a broom and it FLIES into his hand. The light still lives!","true":true}
