Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney\\, I'll make this simple for you\\, if you place activism above story\\, you're going to upset the majority of people who aren't activists and don't subscribe to your views. It's so bad\\, that nearly every scene jettisons aliens and replaces them with an absurd amount of human races. This picture borders on racist considering how race focused it is. Stop being weird about race Disney\\, it's creepy\\, and you're only exacerbating the the 22 year low Hollywood is experiencing.","true":true}
