Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Even if I wasn't a huge Star Wars fan\\, I would have hated this movie. It's a mess of dead end plot holes\\, undeveloped characters remaining unchanged\\, and a clear lack of coherent theme. I can't think of a single way in which this movie moves the needle at all for the Star Wars Franchise besides ruining the interesting plot lines and character arcs that The Force Awakens began..","true":true}
