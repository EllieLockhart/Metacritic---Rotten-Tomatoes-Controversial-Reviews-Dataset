Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie soo much. All the characters really pop and each have an emotional journey (all too often ignored by big movies these days). Does the plot always make sense? The internet has told me it does not in the days since I saw the movie. But I'll tell you I did not care one bit sitting in that theater. The new characters continue to be amazingly succesful at carrying this franchise. I am incredibly curious to see where Episode IX is gonna end up.","true":true}
