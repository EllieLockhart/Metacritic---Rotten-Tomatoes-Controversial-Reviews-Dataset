Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The cast of course do their job perfectly in this movie. I've been excited for this film since force awakens and I am a huge Star Wars fan but for me it wasn't good at all. Without spoiling it I felt like a lot of things involving the force and whatever else didn't make a whole lot of sense it felt like it was just convenient to the plot. Wasted potential right here","true":true}
