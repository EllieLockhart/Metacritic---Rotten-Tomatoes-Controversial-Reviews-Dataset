{"101487":136895,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-05","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Impressive. Every scene in that movie was wrong.\\\" - SWFan \\n\\nThe last Jedi fails to tell the story; it is full of many pieces of undeveloped ideas that belong in some other really bad movies. \\n\\nThe Star Wars Saga has been an incredible journey.  I loved the first movies\\, learning of the Jedi lore and the tangled ribbons of coherent drama\\, intrigue\\, suspense\\, and imagination. It was a ground-breaking\\, hold-your-breath experience that had you on pins and needles waiting to find out how the universe far\\, far away would be righted. Likewise\\, I enjoyed the majesty\\, mystery\\, and turmoil of the following prequel trilogy that contrast the revelation of Anakin's fall.   Then J.J. Abrams made magic happen awakening our hearts with the powers of the force renewed. Furthermore\\, the Rogue One narrative snared akin to a spider's web\\, hook-line to a shockingly captivating finale.   In each of these tales\\, Star Wars has been a cohesive line of thought building to a crescendo\\, and even the beloved droids in each of these movies have made valuable contributions to the storylines...until now.   \\n\\nNow we have Rian Johnson scraping the diamonds into the trash with all his other garbage filler.  In his version presented in The Last Jedi\\, we are given unrelated fragments with no regard to the story arc\\, no build for the hero's fall to even remotely establish a belief or investment into Luke's uncharacteristic personality change\\, and no balance in what force use actually means.   Now that Rian Johnson's Jedi ghosts can call lightning down from heaven\\, they can just zap Kylo Ren and this horribly written movie into the place wherever Snoke came from.  The boundaries that made the story cohesive have been obliterated to the point that anyone can do anything with the force without training\\, practice\\, or any measure of expertise\\, and so the foundations that built the lore have been shattered like glass.  With all the openings that J.J. Abrams offered in his respectful bow to Lucas' genius\\, there is simply no way to fix this chaotic mess Rian Johnson hurled in our direction\\, and I am sorry to see this 40-year love affair end. \\n\\n\\nThis disaster of a movie has Jedi lore morphed into an ADHD Marvel altered universe with Mary Sue and Mary Poppins starring in a story mucking about in pointless spinning circles\\, dead ends\\, ill jokes\\, misplaced subtext and substance\\, no character development\\, unanswered or poorly answered questions\\, and the hero's Sybil complex. I waited decades to find out what happened to Luke\\, and I got rubbish. As an original fan thrilled to hear Lucas permitting his jewel to continue and knowing the potential\\, I am now forced to remove this monumental disaster\\, The Last Jedi\\, from my own personal Star Wars canon. This version left a lingering physical gut-punched reaction-like the day you find your love cheating; it's a betrayal of lore and character. With green teat milk\\, floating force filled super-Leia\\, and Yoda flubs\\, fandom can already Force project the future outcome of a Rian Johnson-trilogy: Garbage Shoots I\\, II\\, &....Toss This Over Your Shoulder-Fail III. \\n\\n\\n\\nRian Johnson can polish a rock\\, and we can all say it is a real shiny rock\\, but hey\\, a rock is just a rock. And regardless of all the talent and resources at his fingertips\\, his story hit rock bottom on the fan meter because this movie is not Star Wars lore. It should be renamed Rian Wars and be buried off-world far\\, far away.  \\n\\nPodium pollution aside with all the many awkward insults to various groups\\, perhaps Disney was attempting an anti-order or Antireligion propaganda to soothe big pocket snowflakes.  In the next movie they can eliminate child slavery\\, because they surely exterminated franchise's baby in this one.\\n\\nI am not of the new generation that just likes shiny rocks\\, but being familiar with the type\\, I regret that Walt Disney now caters to that crowd.  My last hope is that the Skywalker story sees justice someday in a real fan film.   Disney\\, you don't deserve your ears or my rebel credits!","true":true}
