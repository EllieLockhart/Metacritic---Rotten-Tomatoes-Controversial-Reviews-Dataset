Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this star wars movie is well made\\, has heart and is entertaining. \\\"Whether or not you like The Last Jedi depends on whether you surrender to it's pleasures or think hard about them.\\\"","true":true}
