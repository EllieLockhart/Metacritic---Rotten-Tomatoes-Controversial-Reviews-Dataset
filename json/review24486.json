Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Most disjointed and Star Wars film ever.  Film started off well but then look a massive downward plunge. Too many plot holes to mention. Terrible writing. Terrible characterisation  on every level from the new characters to a icon like Luke. Rey is Jedi despite no training. And Luke is a grumpy old hermit. Great! It says a lot about how badly a film is thought out when you could cut large chunks of it out and it would make no difference to the plot. When you think about how many great EU stories there are\\, Disney have not really done a great job so far with this trilogy. Very poor","true":true}
