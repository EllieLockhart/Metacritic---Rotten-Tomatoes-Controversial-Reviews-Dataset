The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Spoiler inside\rAfter the first game\\, a true masterpiece\\, many years have passed. Nowadays feminists sjw and other categories are trying to destroy all the good that various fanchises like star wars\\, ghostbusters\\, marvel\\, disney did in the past. So they reverse all the franchises and put feminist masculine main characters to kill the standard white male patriarch. This is absurd because all the franchises we love from the past have nothing of discriminatory. but feminist and sjw are obsessed and will follow with their agenda in the next years. Trying not consider this political aspect\\, the game itself is garbage. In fact the story is ridicolous. In the begin you kill joel in a bloody way\\, next you play the role of the  monster who killed him. You are obbliged. Next you play ellie to revenge him\\, you kill hundreds of people and innocents. At the end you save ebbie and let himher go. This is no sense. So the entire plot is created only to promote the sjw agenda\\, nothing is logical. The gameplay has nothing more than you can expect\\, the game is also repetitive\\, and you play the role of a character you hate\\, that make choices you don't agree with. The graphics can't save such bull **** On the other end we see Sony new double standard. LGBT SJW FEMINIST GAMEs can have nude and sex por.n scenes. If you don't agree then you are homophobe.  But games like resident evil 3 have censorships like jill miniskirt. So sex porn lgbt nude scene are ok.... a miniskirt without any sex scene is CENSORED.  So they want to hit the standard female too. Sony shame on you for your crazy politics.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
