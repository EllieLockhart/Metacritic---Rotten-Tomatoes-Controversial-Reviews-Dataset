Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very interesting movie with a great story and awesome characters except Rose who is terrible\\, Luke didn't feel like Luke and  his death ruined the movie my favorite character in Star Wars is dead the movie has some good scenes and graphics but not the best Star Wars movie overall I liked it but the movie could have been better.","true":true}
