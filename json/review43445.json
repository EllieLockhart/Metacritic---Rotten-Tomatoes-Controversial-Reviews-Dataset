Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a solid movie and I highly recommend it. Getting to see our original heroes interact with our new heroes was amazing! Adding to the connectivity. It was funny\\, suspenseful and even touching. I will see it again and can\u2019t wait for episode IX!!","true":true}
