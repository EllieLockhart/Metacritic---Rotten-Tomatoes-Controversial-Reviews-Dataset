Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Kinda wish I could give a negative amount of stars. It pained me to see my beloved series butchered in such a way. Between iconic characters from the past completely ruined in such a way that even the actors fundamentally disagreed with them\\, to poorly choreographed fights this movie just did everything wrong. ScreenRant nailed a lot of what was wrong with this on YouTube\\, but it\u00e2(TM)s difficult to capture just how truly awful this was in a short amount of time (anything under one hour in this case). I am beyond disappointed.","true":true}
