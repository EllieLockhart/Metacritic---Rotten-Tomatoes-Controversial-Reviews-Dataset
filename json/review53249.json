Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Butt hurt fanboys who can't stand that they were wrong. This film deserves 3 stars for cinematography alone.\\n\\nThis was original\\, something the same fanboys complained about when TFA came out - that there wasn't enough originality.\\n\\nThis movie was a wonderful addition the the Star Wars franchise.\\nLet's not forget that Empire Strikes Back was received the same way at first- now it's viewed as the gold standard for Star Wars films.\\n\\nHey megafans- stop complaining.
