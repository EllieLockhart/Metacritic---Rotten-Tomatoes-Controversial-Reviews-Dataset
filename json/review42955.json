Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was terrible and benefited heavily from the old characters being present. The only characters that were characters were the bad guy and FN. Everyone else was a perfect character that can do no wrong such as Rey or a diversity prop. Ill take the central message to heart. Old fans are no longer needed and need to let the past go. Much like their version of Luke. I give up on this franchise.","true":true}
