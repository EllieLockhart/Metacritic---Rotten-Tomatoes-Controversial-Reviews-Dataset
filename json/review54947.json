Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's time for the magic of Star Wars... to end.  The Last Jedi plays like a depressing parody of a Star Wars movie overly written by committee.  Long gone are the bombastic adventures of previous entries in the franchise and in their place we have an A plot of a big ship slowly trailing another big ship\\, waiting for the latter to run out of fuel.  This largely reflected my own experience with the movie as I continually checked my watch throughout.\\n\\nWriter-director Rian Johnson lacks the imagination necessary to compete with George Lucas or Lawrence Kasdan and as a result opted to kill the engaging mysteries presented in The Force Awakens for cheap shock factor\\, leaving the director of Episode IX (announced to be JJ Abrams post-production) with nothing to work with\\n\\nJohnson's complete misunderstanding of the charm of the Star Wars universe and the characters within has left the franchise in jeopardy.  We can only hope Abrams delivers with the sequel","true":true}
