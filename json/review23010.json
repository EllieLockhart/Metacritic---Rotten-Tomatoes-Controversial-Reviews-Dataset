Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*Lots of spoilers.*  The critics don't know Star Wars.  The one good thing was the dark\\, retro-futuristic aesthetic of the Snoke's throne room.  What's bad?  Kylo Ren was unimposing\\, even angsty\\,\\, and star wars should have an imposing villain.  He kills Snoke without any real thought or consequence.  The rules of the force were changed without explanation.  Gigantic ships were able to be destroyed improbably.  A tiny outfit of the rebellion is supposed to save the galaxy.  Too many jokes.  Going the way of I\\, II\\, and III.  Leia can survive in space.  Kylo Ren knows where Luke is hiding and doesn't kill him outright.  Not dark enough.  Feels like a cheap knock-off.  Finn finds the person he's looking for by a billion-to-one chance?  Minorities don't really get a strong showing\\, though women do.  Admiral Holdo does not share her plan\\, an improbable plot device to keep up suspense.  Potentially ruined Star Wars' potential comeback.  Good riddance\\, the knock-off era of movies should come to an end\\, there is more under the sun\\, despite what Hollywood seems to believe.  See it\\, but hate it\\, it's what once fans seem to be doing.","true":true}
