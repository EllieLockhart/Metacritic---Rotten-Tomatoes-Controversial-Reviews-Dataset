Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There was a lot I liked and a lot that I didn\u00e2(TM)t. It still feels to similar to the originals. As soon as I started to like the changes in direction the movie was taking\\, I felt it suddenly gave up and went back to square one. At the very least the movie ends in such a way that they won\u00e2(TM)t be able to keep rehashing the original trilogy.","true":true}
