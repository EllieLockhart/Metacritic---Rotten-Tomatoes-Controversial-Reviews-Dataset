Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I won't say too much so as not to accidentally let something slip. There are some good spoilers to be had if you're not careful on the internet ;)\\nI'd need to see it again to be sure of what I think about it\\, but it's quite a different style the new director has delivered. It's a roller coaster of emotion and misdirection. To me it feels a bit like \\\"The Prisoner of Azkaban\\\" of Star Wars movies. \\nIt's long (2.5 hours) but I prefer more Star Wars rather than less. There is something in it for everyone. At times it's very funny and child like\\, other times it's dark and desperate. It plays the role of the middle movie in a trilogy in a similar way to The Empire Strikes Back. There are some big head nods to Empire\\, but I didn't feel that it wasn't original enough. The Last Jedi is to Empire Strikes Back as Pirates of the Caribbean is to Master and Commander.","true":true}
