Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Holy smokes\\, the movie is bad. This will probably be the lowest audience score of any Star Wars film. It's gap between what critics say and what the audience says indicates many critics were well paid for their reviews.","true":true}
