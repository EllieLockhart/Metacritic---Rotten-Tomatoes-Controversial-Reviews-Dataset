Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful Star Wars film. So many bad writing and directing decisions. Second worst Star Wars film after The Phantom Menace.  Obvious director didn't know what to do with Phasma and Snoke so he just killed them.  Slowest chase in history\\, why did Hux not just send ships ahead of Rebel ship by light speed to cut them off? So many awful scenes\\, Luke throwing the lighsabre over his shoulder\\, Luke milking the creature\\, the ironing scene\\, Leia's scene in space had the audience in stitches\\, every scene on Canto Bight\\, topless Kylo Ren\\, Anakin 2.0 and the list goes on and on. Johnson should be removed from any future Star Wars project as this was a terrible attempt at a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
