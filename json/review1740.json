Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a star wars fan and sci fi fanatic\\, i can honestly say this film is awful. It was nothing more than a collage of star wars stock footage\\, a messy narrative composed of happenings from earlier movies poorly placed into an attempt at a story\\, and a script so soulless it could have been written by an A.I. It seems that Disney has been paying corporations and journalists for good reviews to fool the public into going to see this tragic garbage money maker. It's a sad time to be a Star Wars fan","true":true}
