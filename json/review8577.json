Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First of all\\, it must be noted that episode 8 is a Star Wars movie. What I mean by that is none of the Star Wars movie scripts are exceptional. It is Star Wars. It\u2019s the visuals. It\u2019s the music. And it\u2019s the Force. After waiting a week to see the movie and hearing the naysayers and those touting the movie as great\\, I had very low expectations going in. The result was I was pleasantly surprised. There wasn\u2019t anything earth shattering different but it was consistent with the original story and\\, I thought opened the door to the next few movies to have different plot lines. I was actually glad that not one character dominated the movie. In this regard it was more like an avenger movie with many characters. I believe this helped the movie have scope and kept the Star Wars universe intact.","true":true}
