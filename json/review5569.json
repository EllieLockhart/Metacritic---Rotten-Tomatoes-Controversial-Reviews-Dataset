Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"DID MICHAEL BAY DIRECTED THIS MOVIE? I will save you money and loss of brain cells.  This movie annuls SW 1-7.  If you like Transformers movies\\, you will love SW TLJ.  #DONOTBELIEVEMOVIECRITICS","true":true}
