Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After the Force Awakens\\, I didn't believe Disney could take Star Wars any lower. I was very wrong. I am sorry George.","true":true}
