Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dozens of huge plot holes\\nA rescue just in time \/ deus ex machina moment every 10 minutes\\nSide quests where nothing is accomplished and adds nothing to the plot (the entire casino planet story line)\\nKilling off major characters with no set up or back story whatsoever (Snoke)\\nLeia floating like freaking Mary Poppins through the vacuum space with no Force bubble \/ shield or anything\\nThe two biggest powers in the galaxy (the Resistance & The First Order) fitting into about 3 ships and 6 AT-ATs\\nSpace bombers that drop bombs that depend on gravity (and controlled with a garage door opener for good measure)","true":true}
