Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi expands the Star Wars Universe into a new era. \\nI liked the risks they take\\, I definitely want to watch it a second time. When things don't happen the way fans expect them\\, that is not a bad thing. The same people who  accuse The Force Awakens of being an imitation of the New Hope accuse the Last Jedi of being \\\"not starwars\\\". please decide!","true":true}
