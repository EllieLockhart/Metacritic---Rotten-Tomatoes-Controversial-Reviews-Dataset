Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nice effects but the rest varies from good to terrible. This movie has terrible writing\\, shows no respect to the previous\\, makes bad puns that does not fit and forces political opinions.\\nThe movie seems to lack a basic understanding of time and space travel\\,  more than the other movies.\\nThe pacing is bad and the movie is a bit to long overall.\\nThis movie made me miss The Phantom Menace even.","true":true}
