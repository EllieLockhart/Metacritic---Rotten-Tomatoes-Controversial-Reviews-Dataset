Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing it a few times\\, I have to say that this is my favorite Star Wars film\\, ever. It was innovative\\, thoughtful\\, and full of heart. By far the most enjoyable aspect of the film for me was the character development for every single main character (old and new) within the franchise\\, with particular emphasis on the growth seen between Kylo Ren\/Ben Solo and Rey. I can't wait to see where their characters and relationship is headed in the next installment. I think Rian Johnson set the next film up for a fantastic ending.","true":true}
