Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a complete abortion of Star Wars. Rian Johnson is the worst. I won't watch anything he touches and won't go near the new films. Thank you for ending the Star Wars franchise. \\n\\nIt was a bad film and he holds the blame for it\\, that is removing Star Wars from the title. Stand alone\\, terrible film. Add Star Wars to the mix? He may have killed the franchise's soul and killed hype for the next.","true":true}
