Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a stand alone film in the franchise and is one of the most emotion-rich and thought provoking in the saga. The movie soars due to the powerful performances by Daisy Ridley and Mark Hamill. The only negative aspect of this installment was the busy work storylines that they gave to the rest of the supporting cast that caused the film to be unnecessarily long. However\\, all in all\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi gives fans of the franchise and common moviegoers alike the wow-factor experience that they are looking and hopeful for.","true":true}
