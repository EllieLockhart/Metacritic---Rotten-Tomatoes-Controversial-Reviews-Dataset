It would be awesome to see that in second part\\, but we didn\u2019t wait 7 years for that. We were waiting for a game with best graphics\\, gameplay\\, story and we did get that! Plus we got a small\\, fantastic episode of good old Joel and Ellie.\rWhy can\u2019t you just put aside emotional luggage from the first part and just play?\rThis game doesn\u2019t deserve fu**in deserve 4.4...Naughty dog doesn\u2019t deserve this hate...\u2026 Expand","true":true}
