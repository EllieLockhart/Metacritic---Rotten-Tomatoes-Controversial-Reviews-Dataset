Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved everything about this film. It was daring and wondrous and pushed Star Wars to a place that my children will continue to love it the way that I was won over by the first film at 5 years old.","true":true}
