Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All Johnson had to do with Luke was land the plane\\, but by turning Skywalker into a depressed coward he betrayed the character of the greatest hero in sci-fi cinema history. That's the disappointing part. The characters that made TLJ a bad movie\\, however\\, were the meaningless or counterproductive parts of Poe\\, Finn\\, Rose\\, Phasma\\, 3PO and R2. Seriously\\, if the point is to not appease older fans and get us to move on\\, then why not throw those outdated and irrelevant droids in a smelting pit? Or just leave them out of the story altogether? They serve zero purpose.\\n\\nWorry not\\, however\\, because the lesson of failure seems to be really important to Johnson. Though I'm not certain he 'is what he's gone beyond.' Rather\\, he is what he failed to reach. TLJ  isn't a good as a bucket of bolts.","true":true}
