Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars the Last Jedi is a movie filled with character development\\, with actors that have amazing chemistry with each other. The movie is full of laughs and twists\\, and despite a few scenes that failed to convey the director's vision\\, the writing of the story and dialogue and the thrill of the action sequences are superb. The explorations into the force\\, and the characters' motivations are well explored and bring us the rise of Darth Vader that the prequels never could. This is definitely one of the best star wars movies so far and that warrants a 5 star rating.","true":true}
