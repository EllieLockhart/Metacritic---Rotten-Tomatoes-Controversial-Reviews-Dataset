Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Single worse Star Wars film ever made. Expect everything you love and know about Star Wars to be trashed in this film.    Imagine preparing the most extravagant meal with the most expensive and luxurious ingredients in the world. You spend days preparing the food\\, then as you plate up you pour two buckets of salt on top of everything. Your wonderful well made food ruined under a mountain of salt. This is exactly what the director did in the Last Jedi\\, he destroyed it. It was overlong\\, far too conscious of itself with crude plot twists and no love for the characters. It was as if an alien had landed on earth and never seen the other films and just made it in an afternoon. The words Last are very meaningful\\, it's the last time I will go to a Star Wars film\\, the Last time I will care about a star wars film and the last time any fan will have hope of seeing a film fans deserve. The Jedi are WELL AND TRULY DEAD!!  Great work Disney!! Took some doing to destroy this franchise.","true":true}
