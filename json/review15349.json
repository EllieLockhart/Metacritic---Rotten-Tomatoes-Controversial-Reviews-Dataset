Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'll spare everyone from the usual that also applies to me: lifelong SW fan\\, so much of the franchise is imprinted into my DNA etc. This movie was awesome. In a galaxy a long\\, long time ago a story was born that changed franchise cinema\\, unfortunately it's tropes and conventions became old hat over time. Despite a shot in the arm by a paradoxically backwards looking Episode VII\\, The Last Jedi takes this corner of the galaxy and it's characters exactly where they need to be. As well as being magnificent cinema even if you're not invested in this franchise\\, TLJ is the logical sign post for where it needs to go to avoid becoming a walking corpse. Magical.","true":true}
