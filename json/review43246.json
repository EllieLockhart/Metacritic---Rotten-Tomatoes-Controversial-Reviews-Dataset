Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a amazing movie!! Its taking Star Wars in a whole new direction and I am totally on board! Star Wars fans are never satisfied and this movie is utter proof they would bitch at a movie they wrote!! I am a Star Wars fan and after seeing this movie and the things I have heard \\\"true\\\" Star Wars fans think I am ashamed to be put in the same group as them","true":true}
