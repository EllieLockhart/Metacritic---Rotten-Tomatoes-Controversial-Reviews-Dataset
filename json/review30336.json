Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Second worst Star Wars ever\\, really dumb\\, too long\\, betray all the story of Star Wars\\, and do things that are really surprising\\, or unexpected\\, because they were bad ideas\\, we didn't expected a story wer they could make all the wrong decisions ... And it's official now\\, the force is only a thing to explain something magic in the movie like \\\"- hey dude what's happenning\\, why is this shit doing that ? - Because of the force!\\\" ... Good job disney\\, you just ruined my fqvourite universe in less than 3 movies! Sorry but i am not a stupid ship who likes jokes that are a pain in the ass mostly\\, and a story without any other level of comprehension\\, all we get is all we see\\, there nop place for interpretation ...","true":true}
