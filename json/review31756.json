Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So this showed up on Netflix and I figured I'd check it out as I've enjoyed the series generally. I gave it 10 minutes and thought it was horrible\\, so I convinced myself to give another 10. In the end I watched about 2\/3\\, and it was like a train wreck where you don't REALLY want to see the carnage but you can't look away because it's unbelievable. I can't believe this is what Star Wars has become\\, it's absolutely ridiculous. The acting was decent\\, but the fact that the writing and story are so horrible makes the good acting cringey. It's like watching a bunch of kids play dress up. I spent the whole time either laughing at the ridiculousness or with my face scrunched up as I wondered if it was some elaborate joke. The fact that it's rated so highly and has legions of fans backing it make me feel sad at the state of the film industry\\, and the human race's intelligence all-together.","true":true}
