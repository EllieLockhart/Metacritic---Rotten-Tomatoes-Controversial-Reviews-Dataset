Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went into this movie not seeing any trailers and avoiding discussions\\, rumors\\, and speculation all together\\, if you plan on seeing The Last Jedi (Which let's face it\\, you probably are) I'd recommend  trying your very best to avoid outside information all together as for me watching The Last Jedi  gave me a feeling of wonder and engagement  I haven't felt in awhile. It's not a perfect movie but a near-perfect experience that showcases a love for Star Wars. While TFA went along the lines of Star Trek 09 in rebooting and establishing Star Wars the Last Jedi takes true steps to give this new era of Star Wars an identity combing compelling characterization and a story with twist and turns that make it the strongest Star Wars since Empire.","true":true}
