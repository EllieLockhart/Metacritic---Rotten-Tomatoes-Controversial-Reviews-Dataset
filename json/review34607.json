Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The casino subplot could have been removed and the screenplay could have been tighter and more refined.  But\\, it's a good addition to the Star Wars universe and worthy of a watch.  If you cut the fat\\, it's probably better than The Force Awakens.  Otherwise\\, it's on par with TFA and stuck in the middle between the prequels and the originals as far as overall quality.","true":true}
