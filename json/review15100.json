Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left with more questions than i had when i went in. So much we hoped to be explained from 'The Force Awakens' wasn't even touched on and was extremely disappointing. While watching this\\, if you need the toilet just wait for when Finn and Rose go to the casino. Most unnecessary and pointless chunk of a film I've ever seen. I expected so much more from this film. lets hope they can make up for this in the next one.","true":true}
