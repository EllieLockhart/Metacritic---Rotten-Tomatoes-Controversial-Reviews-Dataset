Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If there was anyone who was upset that Force Awakens was remake you are going to get something fresh with Last Jedi... Movies\\, as a basic part of storytelling usually lead you and as a 40 year old fan of Star Wars\\, you think you know where the movie is going to take you. Like when you go into someone\u2019s house\\, and based on general home layouts\\, you usually can find the bathroom. In this case Last Jedi will be the House where you thought the bathroom was supposed to be and it is not. This happens several times. Leave the Typical in the movie theater parking lot and get ready for a novel story you will never anticipate. No more remakes! ","true":true}
