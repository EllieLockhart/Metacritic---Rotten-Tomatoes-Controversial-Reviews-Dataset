Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie really good. It adds nuance to characters and their arcs and even questions the concepts that Star Wars is built upon. I am baffled by the low ratings from other audience members for this movie. The pacing at points could be tighter since it does fall prey to second-movie-itis. The character dynamics are interesting and different for a Star Wars film\\, but this movie still feels true to the franchise.","true":true}
