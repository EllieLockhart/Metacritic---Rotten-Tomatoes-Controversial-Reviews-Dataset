Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' is one of the most polarising films in history. This film had great moments and TERRIBLE moments\\, most of the film was spent in two ways: either developing the story or wasting it with bad jokes. The film offered some iconic moments and scenes such as the throne room scene but a lot of the film was boring or just plain BAD. For example\\, the horse racing scenes with Finn & Rose were very boring and the Luke scene was very bad. I hate what Rian Johnson done with Luke's character in the film\\, we only got one good Luke scene and it barely even had any dialogue. Some of the action sequences were good and the acting was on point but the story just didn't develop and Admiral Ackbar died! New characters were boring and pointless\\, all they did was cancel out other characters scenes! But for all the great scenes and iconic moments\\, I have to rate the film 70%. P.S. I never thought i'd says this but I'm happy for J.J. to come back.","true":true}
