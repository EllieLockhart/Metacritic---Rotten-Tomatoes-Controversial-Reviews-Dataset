Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Theres a disconnect between expectation and reality that's destroying the reputation of these movies. People want a Star Wars movie that meets their inflated expectations and forget to consider if the movie is good as a movie\\, expectations notwithstanding. On that front\\, The Last Jedi is leagues better than most of the trash being pumped out by Hollywood. \\n\\nIf you dislike this movie because of the wierd pacing\\, or how most things that happen end up being totally ineffectual\\, then fair game\\, that's perfectly valid. Those are actual issues. If you didn't like it because  it didn't meet your personal expectations\\, thats fine too\\, but maybe the next go around you should probably tamp them a bit. Give yourself a reality check and ask \\\"What can I reasonably expect from this movie\\, rather than what I want to see?\\\"\\n\\nAnd\\, if you don't like it because it's \\\"SJW bullshit\\\" or whatever madness is going on inside your head\\, you can kindly fuck off.","true":true}
