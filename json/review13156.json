Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't mind a long movie so long as it's justified\\, however for Star Wars The Last Jedi this is not the case. Without the meaningless plot points and unnecessary\\, cringy \\\"comedy\\\" this film could have been summed up in 90 minutes. As a massive Star Wars fan ever since I was a little kid I left the cinema not only disappointed but angry. It takes the beats of empire and\\, well beats it\\, too many mary sue moments\\, flat and quite frankly lackluster characters\\, the porgs are the baby groot of this film\\, stupid and only there for selling toys. This was a film that is branded for Star Wars fans young and old but will find itself alienating the more longstanding fan base. I've given this film 2\/5 instead of a 0\/5 because it did have some redeeming qualities but nowhere near enough to justify the camel of a screenplay.","true":true}
