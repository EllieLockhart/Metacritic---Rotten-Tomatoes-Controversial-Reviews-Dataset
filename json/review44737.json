Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Trash. If you were hoping for the magic they created in The Force Awakens you will be HIGHLY disappointed. Literally every cliff hanger from that movie was cut in this movie with little or no back story. This movie was literally a political stunt about how Woman know best...I didn't mind that...as much as I did with Johnson actually saying him wanting to leave his print on the Star Wars saga...and that he did. This is why more than one Director shouldn't direct a trilogy. Highly disappointed. Don't understand how the audience and the \\\"pros\\\" could be so far apart.","true":true}
