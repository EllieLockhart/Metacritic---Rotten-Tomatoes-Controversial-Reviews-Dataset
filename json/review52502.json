Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A horrible film with no direction and lazy writing. I was expecting Rey to be awesome and go through this journey to figure out how she fits in the Jedi universe\\, but her role faded away. The story mainly focused on Poe (who is a very childish\\, annoying character) and Finn. Kyle Ren is also a terrible (and childish\/annoying) villain. Not looking forward to the next film. I left the theater very disappointed.","true":true}
