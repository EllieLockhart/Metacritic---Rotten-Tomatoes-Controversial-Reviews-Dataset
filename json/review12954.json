Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I do not consider this garbage a Star Wars film in the slightest. These critics are hilariously mistaken probably because they are casual moviegoers and do not understand the Star Wars universe.","true":true}
