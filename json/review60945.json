The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The game's story is BAD\\, it's \\\"dark\\\" and depressing just for the sake of it. They disrespected one of my favourite characters of last Gen\\, and literally spit on his corpse. Not only that\\, but the way that to his death was badly written\\, like everything conspired so that Abby  would be attacked by clickers and Saved by Joel\\, and she had no idea that it was him who killed her father\\, and just like that\\, Joel and his brother end  up on the camp of Abby's clan and trust them (even though they have years of experience and know that there bandits and merciless people out there) and are like hi my name is Joel Miller... That's just ridiculous\\, cartoon level of writing.Now the ending\\, my god the ending\\, Joel dies like 2hours in\\, so you spend all the journey with Ellie\\, killing everyone on your way to get to Abby and take revenge\\, and guess what\\, REVENGE BAD\\, she fights her\\, drwons her\\, then get a flash back of Joel playing guitar\\, and then let her go? Like what? What?! You're telling me that the guy who sacrificed the world for you\\, died because of this decision\\, and you killed everyone to get to the killer and avenge him\\, then decide nah\\, not worth it...I'm seriously speechless\\, if you've noticed I haven't talked about anything LGBT or Agenda pushing **** I have no problem with them\\, my problem with the game goes beyond that\\, I love old Bioware games\\, and they already had gay characters\\, so nothing new.And talking about nothing new\\, well\\, the gameplay hasn't evolved that much\\, jump button\\, sprint jump\\, dodge? I mean it's the same TLOU1 experience expanded in some open areas. I would rather recommend you buy Days Gone you can get it for cheap\\, has good gameplay and sandbox\\, and is also a zombie apocalypse game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
