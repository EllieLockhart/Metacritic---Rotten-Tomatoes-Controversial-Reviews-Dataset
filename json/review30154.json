Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Same issue with most Hollywood movies nowadays\\, it suffers from bad writing and an odd vision. Hollywood people just don\u00e2(TM)t live in the real world. The only character I even remotely like is Rey\\, and maybe Gen Hucks. If at the beginning of the next movie Hucks fires a Kilo torpedo into the millennium falcon I would probably applaud. Probably make ep 9 better.","true":true}
