Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ugh\\, such a disapointment\\, from the initial bad sarcasm between hux and poe to the end...it sucked. Everything with Finn and the Asian girl was lame and didn\u2019t develop character. I briefly enjoyed the Skywalker fight\\, but that\u2019s it. Yoda added nothing. Laura derns character made no sense and Superman leia was an absolute terrible idea. Not excited for Star Wars anymore...","true":true}
