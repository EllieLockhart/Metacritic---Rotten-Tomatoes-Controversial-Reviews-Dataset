Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To start this film looks beautiful\\, and the actors tried they're best\\, But does not save this film. \\n- Luke skywakers character has been dumb down to an old man\\, who say get off my lawn\\n- canto bright scene really has no point it  is filler\\n- Lots of SJW stuff shoved down and it makes no sense in Star Wars\\n -The story set up in Ep.7 has really gone no where\\, \\n-lots of  plot holes bigger than a crater \\n- it turns a lot of characters(Heroes) into horrible people\\nJust to name a few things. This movie has destroyed Star wars and its fan base. I hope they can save star wars after this film.","true":true}
