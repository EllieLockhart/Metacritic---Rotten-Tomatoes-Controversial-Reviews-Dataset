Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"1. Sloppy editing\\, bad visual effects\\, and a lackluster soundtrack plagued the film at every turn.\\n\\n2. The plot went fucking nowhere. There was no resolution at the end\\, just a weak tie-in to a future film you don't really care if they make or not.\\n\\n3. Almost every single character was shoehorned in\\, made terrible decisions\\, and made no logical sense.\\n\\n4. The jokes were forced and really\\, really cringeworthy.\\n\\n5. Random force powers that until now have made zero appearances in anything\\, one of which actually made me groan out loud (when it happens\\, you'll know).\\n\\nAnd that's just off the top of my head. I'm sure there will be a lot more given some time to think about it. I'm not one of those people who dislikes propaganda films (300\\, Battleship Potemkin\\, Mad Max: Fury Road\\, and 13 Hours were all conspicuous propaganda films that I really enjoyed). But this was the kind of propaganda film that was so heavy-handed\\, so over-the-top\\, and so utterly artless I was actually shaking my head in disbelief that this level of schlock made it past any sort of editing process. The whole thing was written like something you'd read off of fanfiction.net or somebody's Tumblr.\\n\\nAs far as bad movies go\\, it wasn't even bad in a way that was enjoyable. Some films are so bad that they circle right around to awesome. This film stopped shy of awesome and lingered there. Maybe it's because I just saw it\\, so I don't have enough perspective yet. Time will tell whether or not it's the kind of bad film that you'll watch with friends and get drunk to. As it stands\\, it's the wrong kind of bad movie. I took my wife and a couple friends out to see it\\, and in paying for everyone's tickets\\, I thoroughly martyred myself. Pirate this movie if you want to see a dumpster fire\\, but don't give Disney any more reason to keep making garbage like this.","true":true}
