Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"May require another viewing but there was some things I really liked in what Rian Johnson brought to the saga but some major holes with the plot points.  The highs weren't high enough.  Too much of the big Mouse thumb print in selling tshirts and action figures.  Spoiler: Instead of a half hour at the Casino for what could have been done in a fraction of that time\\, spend more time explaining the emotional connection between why Skywalker is why he is. I mean they only a spend a fraction of time there when that needed another 30 mintues to give his story some weight. I don't know what the critics are seeing that I am not and that's a shame because I really want to like it.","true":true}
