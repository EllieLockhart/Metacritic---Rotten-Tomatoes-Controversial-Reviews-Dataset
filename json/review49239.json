Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie in the franchise. I am not only done with Star Wars\\, I refuse to see any film Rian Johnson makes. Nice job with the casino scene and Super Leia","true":true}
