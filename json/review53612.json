Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Finally someone did what had to be done: to do something new.\\n\\nWRONG\\n\\nThere is a difference between introducing something new and completely obliterating a saga so much that it becomes unrecognizable.\\n\\nIf you want something radically different from the STAR WARS movie\\, you are free to watch something else! Aren't you?\\nYou like Mary Poppins? More power to you! Watch it! Maybe Mary taught Leia how to fly in space!\\nYou like Twilight? No one will stop you from watching it over and over! Shirtless young men everywhere!\\nYou like The Lord of the Ring? Go watching it! Maybe Snoke is the son of Gollum\\, who knows?\\n\\nBut don't come here to tell us that we are a bunch of ignorants just because we tell the truth: this movie IS NOT a Star Wars movie. \\n\\nYou are also free to write and direct something else (Rian Johnson\\, I'm talking to you!) if you hate Star Wars\\, its world\\, its rules\\, its lore and ultimately its fan base!\\n\\nRian\\, you entered our house uninvited and shitted all over. And you blame us for not thanking you and for not telling the world how bold\\, fresh and new is your shit!","true":true}
