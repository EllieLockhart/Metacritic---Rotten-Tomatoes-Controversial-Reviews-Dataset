Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi didn't even feel like a Star Wars film\\, and taking the decades of story and beloved characters out of the equation\\, the film on it's own merits was a complete mess.\\n\\nThe opening of the film is a dragging space battle with extreme tonal dissonance to every other Star Wars movie ever made (literally a 'mom' joke starts the film off.\\n\\nThe only thing that can be said about this sequence is it kick starts Poe's plot. \\n\\nIt takes what felt like 20 minutes to get to Rey and Luke on the island. ANd Johnson just drags dirt all over Luke. I've never seen such contempt for a character like this. Makes the prequels look great frankly.\\n\\nI won't go into too much spoilers\\, in case normal people want to see it\\, or don't\\, that's their business. \\n\\nThis movie just did not work for me\\, the pacing was atrocious\\, the plot was stupid and sidelined with about 40 minutes unnecessary footage and a very heavy handed political agenda shoved down the audiences throat. Even if you agree with the politics\\, I sincerely doubt anyone wants to go to Star Wars for a political lecture. \\n\\nI wanted to like this movie\\, and I came out of the theater feeling like they ruined the franchise.","true":true}
