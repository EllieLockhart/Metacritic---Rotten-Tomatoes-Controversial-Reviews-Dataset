Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had I never seen a Star Wars movie before\\, I probably would have liked this film. In fact\\, as I was watching it\\, it wasn't an unenjoyable experience. The cinematography was on point as with the previous episode. Great music and sound effects\\, beautiful aesthetics. I have very few complaints as far as the production quality itself goes. \\n\\nHowever\\, in the context of the Star Wars universe\\, and all its lore as well as established characters\\, practically nothing in this movie made any sense. As in the Force Awakens (which was a better installment\\, all things considered) Rey is a Mary Sue. It's sad because the people behind this trilogy really had a great chance to make a believable\\, strong female lead with three movies worth of character progression. Instead\\, we get a girl with no particularly impressive background\\, who is still somehow able to mop the floor with anyone who stands in her way\\, not breaking a single hair. Like her little showdown with Luke freaking Skywalker\\, a Jedi Knight with decades of experience\\, where she has had not a year\\, not a month\\, not even a week\\, but a DAY of training. Speaking of Luke\\, what the hell happened to the most good-hearted\\, optimistic person in the galaxy to almost murder his nephew and want to end the Jedi Order by fire? These are less than a tenth of all the major issues I had with this episode. For a Star Wars film this was a joke\\, more closely resembling high budget dramatized fan fiction than an installment in one of the most epic movie series of all time.","true":true}
