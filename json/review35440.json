Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi delivers on entertaining. As a whole\\, a fun time at the movies. It has excellent visual effects and an outstanding set design\\, a good overall story\\, and great musical score. The movie drags slightly about half way through but the first half is gripping and the movie finishes well. Could the movie been better if there was better script and Ms. Fisher\\, apparently ill\\, did not appear so lethargic?-- Yes. But outstanding moments in the film make it a great experience at the movies. My experience was like the fun I had watching the original three Star Wars movies and the Force Awakens and unlike the disappointment with Rouge One and the prequels.","true":true}
