Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is the worst Star Wars movie of all TIME! Worse than The Force Awakens!  Anyone that gives The Last Jedi 5 stars has serious problems and doesn't know what a good movie is or was paid by disney. The Last Jedi ruined Luke Skywalker\\, made Leia superman????  I can go on and on\\, for me The last Jedi doesn't exist and shouldn't be canon. The real and true Star Wars is Episode 1-6\\, Return Of the Jedi is the true official canon ending to the trilogy.","true":true}
