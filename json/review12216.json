Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i am giving this movie 1 star for some of the special effects. the story was a travesty that makes absolutely no ground. Between plot holes\\, character assassinations and twists just for the sake of shock instead of the betterment of the story i left the theater feeling disgusted.","true":true}
