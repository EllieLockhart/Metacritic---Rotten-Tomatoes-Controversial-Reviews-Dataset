Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Best Star Wars movie yet.  Yes\\, I said it\\, even better than Empire Strikes Back.\\n\\nFrom the opening space battle that made you care about a character that was only on screen for a few minutes to the breathtaking twists and turns of watching Rey struggle to find her identity\\, this film takes you on a spiritual and emotional journey.  Writer\/director Rian Johnson knows what Star Wars fans were expecting going in to this movie\\, and completely obliterates your head canon.  Much like Rey in the film\\, we are left feeling uncertain throughout as the film questions some of the central things we thought we knew about the Star Wars saga.\\n\\nIf you are seeking the nostalgia of The Force Awakens\\, or the pulpy fun of A New Hope where the lines are clearly drawn between the dark and light side of the Force\\, this movie may be tough to digest at first.  But for those who loved the Empire Strikes Back and everything that film represents to the Star Wars saga\\, The Last Jedi will reaffirm your faith that this 40+ year old movie franchise still has the ability to move and astound.","true":true}
