Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you liked Ep. VII\\,  you'll likely enjoy this film.  If you didn't you should probably stay away.  Many questions left unanswered.  A movie stretched out far longer than it should have been.  Plot devices scattered through out .  Possibly the worst handling of the character Luke ever imagined.  I can not see them doing such a thing to Rey in the same manner.  The social engineering happening in this film is vomit inducing.  Men are either grumpy\\, idiots\\, demoted\\, villains or just being ordered around or dead.  I'm officially done with Disney's take on Star Wars.  Thought they were on the right track after Rogue One.  I was wrong.","true":true}
