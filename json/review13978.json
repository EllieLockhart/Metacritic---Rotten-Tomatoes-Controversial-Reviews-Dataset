{"101487":132591,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-03-11","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you grew up on Star Wars\\, if you watched Luke defy the Emperor and turn Darth Vader\\, you cannot in good conscience accept The Last Jedi.  Unfortunately the movie wasn't just a bad Star Wars movie\\, it was a bad movie. It was disjointed\\, the plot lead no where. The viewer is left to ask time and again\\, what was that scene supposed to show me? The dialogue was straight out of a tween cartoon. The performances were subpar by several of the actors. Laura Dern was clearly there simply as a Star Wars fan. The story failed to maintain any semblance of the true personality and depth of existing characters. It was just bad.\\n\\nLuke Skywalker sacrifices himself to....... help a few escape? That's it? The Luke Skywalker powerful enough to turn Darth Vader against the Emperor essentially saves a small group of ... what are they the Resistance\\, Rebels\\, or what? The New Republic founded after the fall of the Empire (Post ROTJ) would've been much larger than a handful of planets or systems. Yet somehow the First Order\\, which we are lead to believe is the remnants of the military arm of the Empire under new leadership in The Force Awakens (TFA)\\, is so organized and resourced that it is essentially back in charge.\\n\\nBut I ramble\\, the movie was bad\\, the entire plot thread involving Finn and newcomer Rose was completely meaningless and introduced a half hearted attempt at romance. The Rose character was weakly performed. All it did was make the movie longer and maybe save Finn from himself\\, to teach a lesson?  Equally useless was Poe\\, why would he suddenly become an Uber hot-head? Even Han Solo knew when to be a team player. He may be a gunslinger but he is also an officer in the military and this isn't Mav and Goose in Top Gun. In the end that plot line adds little if anything to the story. Seriously what was the point of Laura Dern's character? Anyone could've played that role\\, and why did the plan have to be secret?\\n\\nThe Force Wakens was an applauded movie\\, one I enjoyed\\, but it was a rehash of A New Hope. What it had going for it was simple\\, it was vastly superior to the Prequel Trilogy. What Rian Johnson did to the Star Wars story wasn't a simple rehash. He basically took the entire original trilogy and threw it out\\, the victory over the Emperor was meaningless. Luke Skywalker was meaningless\\, the Skywalker legacy was meaningless. A New Hope and the Rescue of Leila\\, completely pointless. All you had to know as a viewer was that once a band of rebels defeated the Empire thus creating the First Order.\\n\\nThere are so many issues with this film\\, starship fuel\\, really? But Luke's X-Wing can make it to Degobah and Ahch-To?  I would think ships that size would be nuclear or beyond\\, where did the Death Star fuel up? The contradictions are rife in the film. A flagship intended to direct and support long range combat would not have a fuel issue.\\n\\nThe Force continues to be distorted. Ben Kenobi described it as an energy field created by all living things\\, surrounding\\, penetrating and binding all living souls in the galaxy (Star Wars\\, A New Hope). But here we see further attempts to define ownership and usage of the force. Similar to a video game. But the Force couldn't heal Darth Vader's lungs yet Leia can somehow\\, untrained\\, survive space? I sat up like a bolt in the theatre and looked around to see who bought that shenanigan delivered by Johnson\\, I wasn't alone. I'm told in books she is trained but when is that\\, during her breaks from building a government and running a military? The Force is a natural phenomenon\\, not magic. It isn't a Force Punch\\, Force Push\\, or Force Lightning as some describe its uses. It is simply those trained and sensitive accessing its existence.\\n\\nThe Force contradictions are absurd\\, its one thing to suspend logical belief for amusement\\, it's another to establish so many contradictions. Snokes strength in the Force could not save himself from a light saber right next to him and yet he can telepathically connect two minds across the galaxy and read both of their thoughts? It seems whenever poor plot was revealed either a piece of magic was suddenly available or suddenly nonexistent.\\n\\nThe character usage is awful. Chewie is a bit character that isn't mourning Han Solo at all\\, Rey is a nobody apparently that needs three classes to master all the Force\\, and Kylo\/Ben is a spoiled brat on a temper tantrum. One who couldn't lead a band of clowns in a circus let alone a huge military. In the end who Snoke was didn't matter\\, how Snoke got to Kylo didnt matter\\,  Beyond Snoke what turned Kylo? Who are the Knights of Ren?\\n\\nWho organized the First Order from the remnants of the Military? What systems support the First Order\\, many\\, few? Why is another whimpering whiner who could be a recent college graduate a General with the First Order? Star Wars is a caricature of itself now and the kids are running the story. This movie was just plain bad.","true":true}
