Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've seen it and it awesome...Darth Vader come back to life and kills Luke finally becuase he finds out that Luke was not his real son (jar jar had an affair with his mother during the time she was with Annakin) Overall great movie","true":true}
