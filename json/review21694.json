Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just an insult to previous writers\\, directors\\, and fans. A huge segment with the casino was worthless. Characters doing things that make no sense whatsoever. Breaking the fundamental laws of how things work just for a stab at wow factor. I left the theatre feeling confused and unsatisfied.","true":true}
