Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't bother\\, there are a lot of critics on the Disney payroll hence the divide between their scores and the audience. It is a truly awful film with more than a million plot holes\\, Disney are only in it for the money\\, any true Star Wars fans should be ashamed to get on board with this senseless garbage.","true":true}
