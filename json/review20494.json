Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a Star Wars fan since May 1977\\, and I knew exactly what I wanted to see in episode 8\\, I had the best ideas for every character and what they should do next and how there individual story's should go forward. Rian did absolutely none of it\\, keep me confused and guessing the whole time. Thank you!!!","true":true}
