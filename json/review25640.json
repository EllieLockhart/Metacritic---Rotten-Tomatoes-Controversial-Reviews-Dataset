Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a particularly keen addition to the canon. The sacred mythos is dispensed with\\, any important moments are omitted from the story\\, which is mostly boring with very little character development. There are no emotional moments in this film. Partway through the film it diverts onto a complete waste of plot and character. The film has really no message. Most of it does not make sense in the context of its predecessor\\, or even any of the other films. Nothing behaves as expected in the Star Wars universe. It is as though the executors of this film wondered if they could remove all the vital organs that make up a Star Wars film and still somehow have it be good. The answer is no\\, you can not. \\nThe film will likely be studied in film schools as an example of what never to do when it comes to story\\, character and mythology. The only interesting part of the movie is Rey being unable to get through to Luke at first. The character of Luke is utterly trampled\\, transformed into some dark\\, depressed loser. The story of Poe and Leia served basically no purpose. Rey learned nothing\\, except how to use the force\\, Kylo learned nothing\\, a bunch of characters try to sacrifice or kill themselves at some point\\, and they take great pains to rescue animals but forget about the slave children. \\nChildren will find nothing of interest in this film. They've seen space battles and technical wizardry before.\\nWhat is fascinating is how the film manages to fleece first-time viewers\\, myself included. After viewing I thought\\, well now\\, there's a fine Star Wars film. But the next day I began to feel a nagging sense of doubt. I tried watching the film again and found myself bored. It was then I realized I had been bamboozled by a bunch of shiny technical nonsense\\, that fooled me into thinking there was substance.\\nIt is interesting how people seem to be willing to give this film the benefit of the doubt or look the other way\\, in spite of its innumerable flaws and disgraceful treatment of the characters. \\nIt is also telling that professional film reviewers have also elected to do this\\, when it was assumed it was their job to objectively report whether films were good or bad.\\nI'm going to tell you this right now\\, the film needs to be withdrawn from theaters and entirely re-edited. Fire Rian Johnson\\, for sure\\, get 3 or 4 guys who know how to put together a story\\, and re-release the film.\\nI'm actually not kidding. This is what should happen. How the film made it to release in its unfinished state is beyond comprehension.\\nSomebody needs to get hold of the original footage and re-cut the film. You can save any film in the edit\\, although the story for this one is so fundamentally terrible it might not be possible. But you must TRY anyway.","true":true}
