Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was excellent\\, the only problem is that if you havent seen any star wars movies\\, you wontunderstand anything. Its a movie made for fans  and if you want to see it i recomend you to see the other movies first to understand. But that problem doesnt mean that the movie is bad. Is an excellent movie and i think it is my favorite star wars movie.","true":true}
