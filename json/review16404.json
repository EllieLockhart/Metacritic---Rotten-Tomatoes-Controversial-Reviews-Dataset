Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm so deeply disappointed in this movie! As a long-time Star Wars fan\\, I was so much looking forward to a new installment just to find this... :-( . \\n\\nThe visual and sound effects are as sharp as ever and really beautiful but watch and hear.\\n\\nThe story\\, the unnecessary scenes and the mostly ridiculous humor unfortunately destroys the entire movie though. \\n\\nSeriously\\, the movie has so many issues that I actively do not want to see it ever again! After episode 7 this one feels completely off and weird.\\n\\nEpisodes 1-3 are probably still worse\\, but episode 8 is very close when it comes to the bad taste it left in my mouth.\\nWhat a shame...","true":true}
