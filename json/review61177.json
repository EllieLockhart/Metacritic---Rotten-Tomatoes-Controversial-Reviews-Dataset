Naughty Dog has outdone themselves with immersing the player into their games and making you feel for their characters. The stealth encounters are on a new level of immersion and this became the most paranoia-inducing game I owned. The story is depressing the whole way through\\, you feel the frustration in Ellie and you continue to constantly power on but at what cost? The game is brutal and killing an enemy made me feel a way I never had towards computer A.I. telling you that you cannot pity anyone in this dog-eat-dog world. You find yourself rooting for both Ellie and Abby as they've experienced the same pain and it is the most painful experience during the end fight against each other. Peace of mind is a fictitious concept in this story and no one feels content before the game finishes\\, I grip on to what little amount of hope Ellie has when she leaves her home. Naughty Dog has done an incredible job on leaving players (who appreciate the story) with so much to think about weeks after they've finished the game and that's what I think they wished to accomplish with this new title.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
