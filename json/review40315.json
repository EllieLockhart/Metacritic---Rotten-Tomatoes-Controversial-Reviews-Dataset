Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is one of the biggest let downs I've ever experienced the movie is just bad stale characters boring plot bad pacing a lot of unnecessary stuff dude humor and forced social commentary this would be bad on its own but what makes it worse is that it's Star Wars this film clearly has no understanding of what made the Star Wars franchise a success and blatantly undermindes it this film is an affront to the Star Wars franchise","true":true}
