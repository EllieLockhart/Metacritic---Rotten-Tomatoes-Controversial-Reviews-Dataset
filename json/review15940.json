Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a big fan of Star Wars\\, but not this one. Jokes\\, one liners\\, and unnecessary CGI mar what is a blah plot line that is filled with holes. It is obvious that large parts of the story were cut out\\, even though the movie runs long. Most of the film's subplots are inconsequential in the big picture and really only involve stalling\\, the all-powerful villain is mishandled\\, and big problems seem to have simple solutions that come off as cop-outs. In an effort to seem progressive and teach a lesson it fails to entertain as we expect from Star Wars movies. Laura Dern's Adm Holdo is only superseded by Jar Jar Binks as the character that was most infuriating\/disappointing.","true":true}
