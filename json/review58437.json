Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A great Star Wars movie! It was nice to see something different. I don't understand why so many people have issues with it. The critics have it right this time. A well done movie! Think of it this way\\, if Star Wars 4-6 didn't exist then this movie would have gotten 5 stars from everyone. People are judging these movies too much on the past! If you like movies\\, then you should really really enjoy this one!","true":true}
