Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was OK to mediocre...but I will never use the tomatometer again to judge whether I should go see a movie\\, nor will I ever go see a movie spoiler-free again. I feel like I've just been mugged\\, and I blame myself as much as the movie\\, since I depended only on a tomatometer score and media hype.\\n\\nSo if you're somehow reading this before you go see the movie\\, please reexamine why you are going to go see it. You can objectively see that the tomatometer is not an accurate measure of what average viewers think of the movie.","true":true}
