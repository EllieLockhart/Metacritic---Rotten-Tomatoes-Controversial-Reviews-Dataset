Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"what have you done to star wars? the movies were about the Skywalkers and now you have killed the last Jedi with the Skywalker name. Yall should have changed the end of the movie it wouldn't have taken that long or cost that much more money just 2 more scenes is all you would have needed. this is how I think it should have ended. \\nthey should have changed the end from Luke leaving to Leia since Carrie Fisher is no longer with us. All they had to do was have a trooper tell Rey that Leia needs to talk with her have her sitting down looking away from the room and Rey walking around turn off the audio have the door close. After that have CP3O walk in the room just to see her disappear. Rey then says she's gone she couldn't do it any more with Han gone  and Ben not being able to be turned back and with Luke back the resistance is I good hands there's nothing left but to say goodbye.","true":true}
