Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a good film. It suffers from some of the prequels flaws in poor comedic timing\\, and it is clear that some plot points were cut (or not cut) that could have made the movie flawless. \\n\\nThat said\\, it contains some excellent moments and is a worthy addition to the Star Wars universe. \\n\\nIt is an excellent \\\"middle\\\" film in that it truly starts the process of bridging gap between the old and the new.","true":true}
