Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Is this a perfect film? No. Literally no perfect films exist. This was a wonderful experience when I watched it the cinemas. It is truly heartbreaking to see what this film has done to the fanbase. I loved this film. I think it's characters were amazing. The effects were amazing. The score was amazing. This film was a truly exhilarating experience.","true":true}
