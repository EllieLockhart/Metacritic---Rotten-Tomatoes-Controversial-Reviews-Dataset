Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not Star Wars.  It's Disney trying to turn Star Wars into Marvel and Guardians of the Galaxy.  I like Guardians of the Galaxy.  And I like Star Wars.  But don't try to turn Star Wars into Guardians of the Galaxy.  As a fan of the prior Star Wars movies I can see the franchise being destroyed in front of my eyes by Disney.","true":true}
