Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie disappointed me since it is a copy of earlier Star Wars movies using a formulaic narrative.  I enjoyed the characters and the ending but really did not want to see a carbon copy of scenes from earlier movies produced with new characters. We deserve much better than this.","true":true}
