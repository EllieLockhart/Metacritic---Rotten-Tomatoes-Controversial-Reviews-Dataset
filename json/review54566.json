Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm going to sum up The Last Jedi in one critique. Gravity-based bombers in zero-g. The very idea is absurd and stupid. And one could justify the decision by saying that the bombs use the internal gravity of the ship\\, in which case terminal velocity is not reached. Or the gravitational pull of the ship they are bombing\\, in which case ALL of the lore in the previous films is thrown out the window. But the truth of the matter is that The Last Jedi is just poorly thought out. Probably the only redeeming quality of the film is that it doesn't try to replicate previous films like the Farce Awakens did. Some people complain that it was too different from the previous films. Weeeeellll! It kind of was. It did a better job than the Farce Awakens did at least. But the true weakness if this film isn't the acting. It's the writing. It is not good. Better than the Farce Awakens\\, but I am just NOT sold on character motivations despite the acting efforts of the talented cast. And dear heavens the shark jumping! SOOO MUCH SHARK JUMPING! For a multimillion dollar franchise with hundreds of books to draw from and hundreds or talented writers to call on\\, this movie is a sheer disappointment. I am glad I didn't have to pay to see this movie. I won the tickets. The best part of the movie was the music. Everything else goes downhill from there.","true":true}
