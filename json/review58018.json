{"101487":196711,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-04-02","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the Last Jedi was visually stunning\\, the plot was jumbled up and confusing. There were too many characters and story lines transitioning throughout. Holdo was useless\\, Admiral Akbar should have been the one in her place. \\n\\nWhy are the male characters portrayed as helpless\\, diminished individuals? I couldn't help but feel as though the female leads were constantly being shoved down my throat as the main 'Heroes'\\, From Rey\\, to Rose\\, Rose's sister\\, Holdo and even Leia using the force randomly was terrible. I was disappointed that the female characters were forced for political agenda. \\n\\nThe only scene I enjoyed was the Praetorian Guards vs Rey and Kylo. Other than that I walked out of the theatre disappointed\\, not because of debunked fan theories or because I feel \\\"threatened by women\\\" or because the main lead of the film is a female\\, but  because it was a poorly written film which was too long with a storyline devoted to pointless casino scenes (although looked amazing). The characters were dwindled down rather than progressing forward. Rey and Kylo have returned to square one plus Rose and Finn have a forced romance. \\n\\nIn my opinion\\, Luke was out of character. You mean he would throw away a lightsaber of his fathers!?  Luke would never kill his nephew in his sleep! The same Luke who brought Vader\\, who committed mass genocide back to the light? With Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford out of this trilogy\\, It leaves me questioning how J.J is going to conclude it in one film.","true":true}
