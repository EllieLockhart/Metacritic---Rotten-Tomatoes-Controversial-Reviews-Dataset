Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a fan of Star Wars from the very beginning\\, i found the magic to be missing from The Last Jedi.  I was impressed with\\, and thoroughly enjoyed The Force Awakens and Rogue One\\, but this one just misses the mark.  Bring back J.J. Abrams before Rian Johnson does the same thing with Star Wars that Lucas did to the prequels.","true":true}
