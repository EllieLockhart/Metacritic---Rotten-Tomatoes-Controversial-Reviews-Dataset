Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Looking past the lights and sounds\\, this movie barely feels like Star Wars. Probably the worst story telling since Attack of the Clones. And by the looks of the audience score\\, myself included\\, like it less than Revenge of the Sith. This movie ruined excellent lore started by JJ Abrams\\, and Rian Johnson and Disney should be ashamed of that wasted opportunity. I really thought this franchise would set every record imaginable\\, but now I think that dream is gone. I just hope Disney gets Infinity War right next year. Star Wars is basically dead to me now.","true":true}
