Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A number of great scenes wasted on an overall poorly edited and scripted movie. The constant gag lines and slapstick humor were mostly out of place and made this feel more like a marvel film. The comic relief placed within important scenes really destroyed any emotional weight they may have had. The subplots\\, particularly in the casino planet\\, were a waste of time and could have been removed entirely. The entire rebel storyline seemed unbelievable\\, as did many of the ex machina last minute saves which could have actually brought some real depth to the film. In the end\\, everything of substance took an easy way out. While many potentially great conflicts were teased at\\, few if any panned out in a satisfying way. I feel a great opportunity at finishing the sequel trilogy is now lost.","true":true}
