Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute filth\\, I'm surprised anyone have this the go ahead. The way this new saga is heading is simply awful. There were 3 bright sides to this film\\, the addition of DJ and the casino\\, the fight scenes\\, and the continued acting of FN and Po being incredible. However\\, Snoke is an underwhelming and completely random filler villain\\, Admiral Holdo and Rose are simply unlikeable characters\\, and the film's plot is subpar at best.","true":true}
