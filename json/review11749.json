Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How did this screenplay even make it past the editing table? This movie is full of plot holes bigger than The Supremacy\\, overplayed humor\\, and a complete lack of respect for Star Wars lore\\, characters\\, and fans of the franchize.  0\/5 Will not see again\\, will not purchase\\, will not go see any Star Wars movie directed by Rian Johnson in the future.  This was a JOKE\\, and as with many of the \\\"slapstick\\\" moments in the movie\\, I am not laughing.\\n\\nUpdate: I am reposting this with a score above 1\/2 star ONLY because I've been told that 1\/2 stars \\\"don't count\\\" towards the total audience score.  What bullcrap.","true":true}
