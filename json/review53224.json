Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"boring\\, stupid\\, wished it wasn't  some kind of sick joke.  Plot holes and unnecessary side stories that do nothing for the movie.  It's like these aholes just put ideas in a bucket and randomly pulled them out and stuck them together to create this pathetic excuse for a Star Wars movie.  It's horrible.  So many characters WASTED and misused.  WTF was the climax here?  I guess it was the guards fighting Rey and Kylo Ren after Kylo easily dispatched of Snoke some how? Was it when Luke sends his image across the galaxy to a planet to pretend to fight Kylo Ren and then collapse and die on a mountain after the exertion?  So stupid.  Will NOT watch another one.  They took a massive dump all over Star Wars and the critics are being sucked off by someone to give the reviews they gave.  Over 90% rating.  Get out of here.  The amateur critics giving this more than 2 stars are clueless.","true":true}
