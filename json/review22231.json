Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lame!  This was by far the worst yet in the series.  I really was profoundly disappointed in this movie.  It was so cheesy\\, hard to believe that it has come to this.  The writing\\, acting and set was pathetic  When Laya went flying through space like the witch in the Wizard Of Oz I knew it was doomed for me.  I had already overlooked all the other lame stuff.  Chewey cooking those duck things over an open fire?  Then it buddies watching instead of hauling auhz?  The great Jedi text kept in some open cave?  At this point\\, ?I had to leave.  Don't do it.","true":true}
