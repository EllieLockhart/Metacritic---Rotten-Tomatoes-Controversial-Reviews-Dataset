Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very much a mixed film for me\\, and as someone who enjoyed Force Awakens and Rogue One\\, that's saying something. Even a second viewing didn't improve my opinion. Instead\\, it only deepened the problems from my initial viewing. And with multiple people I know having similar issues with the film\\, it's clear I'm not just imagining things. The more I think about it\\, the worst it seems to get.","true":true}
