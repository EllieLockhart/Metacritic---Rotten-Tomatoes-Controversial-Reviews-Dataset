Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It seems like a crappy thing to say but I love this movie all the more for how much people hated it. There is something fundamentally amusing about a movie that has the message of letting go of the past and not allowing where you've come from to dictate your future to be so highly critized for doing just that. What a fantastic example of a fandom clinging so ruthlessly to its roots that it is unwilling to allow the next generation to join in their club. This movie was a perfect blend of nostalgia and new blood. It allows new character (and a hell of a lot a badass women) to step up and take over a franchise 40years in the making. It's silly at times but then\\, Lucas Films have always had a certain level of whimsy that audience have enjoyed (or at least given a cringing smile to). I cannot believe the hate this movie has gotten. Makes me a little sad to call myself a Star Wars fan but then again\\, let the haters hate. More seats in the theatre for me to rewatch the fun.","true":true}
