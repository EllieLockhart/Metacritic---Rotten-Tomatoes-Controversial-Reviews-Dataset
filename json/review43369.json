Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a mediocre movie\\, nothing more\\, nothing less. The narrative wasn't too great but overall action was fun. The thing that sets this movie back was because of the heavy politics implemented. They definitely prioritized politics over a good narrative with good characters. Luke Skywalker's narrative was poorly thought and executed.","true":true}
