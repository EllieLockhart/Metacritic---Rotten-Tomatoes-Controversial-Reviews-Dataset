Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've seen every Star wars film\\, nothing beats the first trilogy tbh\\, but every Star wars film should be reviewed individually. Most negative reviews are due to the film not going in the direction they had wanted or it didn't live up to their EXPECTATIONS\\, that is no real way to criticize a film. This film was good I can truly say it has been my favorite since the Disney re-boot. I did not enjoy some scenes which is why I give it a 4\/5 but it was a good film worth watching nonetheless\\, especially if you're into the entire Star wars saga like me\\, you just can't miss it.","true":true}
