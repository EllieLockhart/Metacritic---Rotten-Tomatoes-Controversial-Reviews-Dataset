Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a life long star wars fan.. & this I instalement of the franchise was just God aweful. With all the hype\\, and anticipation since episode 7\\, this was just too big of a let down. We all understand the ploy to dsomething \\\"new & fresh\\\" however this was just upsetting. The lack of a plot was compensated with by arguably\\, even worse slap stick humor. It left the next & final episode to be filmed on no substance with no suspense. This movie is almost as bad as episode 1.. it's hard to our George Lucas\\, George Lucas.. but congrats Johnson & Kennedy\\, you guys made a valiant effort. You had multiple fan theories circulation... & some of them were terrible.. but not as bad as what was chosen to happen in this movie.","true":true}
