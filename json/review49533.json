Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow. I don't really know where to even begin with this one. Never in my life have I been so disappointed leaving the theatre. The story was garbage. The pacing was off. There were as many plot holes as plot points. Things were set up and then thrown out\\, jokes were made and didn't land. It stank of a Disney committee. Only watch if you are a Star Wars completionist\\, and even then wait for redbox. This movie is not worth your $10 for a ticket.","true":true}
