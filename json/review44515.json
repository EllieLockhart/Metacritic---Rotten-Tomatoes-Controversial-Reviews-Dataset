Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To say it quite simple: this movie has killed Star Wars. I still can't understand what is the problem with complete misunderstanding of what made this franchise magical in the first place. Also the creative impotence of Disney and Rian Johnson is stunning - how can this world and the Resistance become only worse each time we visit them? Many could be said about this film\\, but ultimately - this movie would be garbage anyway because the foundation of The Force Awakens is just unbearable to continue. Let me jus t roll the kill count of amazing themes and ideas that potentially could be awesome\\, but turned out to be the complete letdown: The new Republic\\, fall of Empire\\, relationship of Han and Leia\\, the new Jedi Order\\,    new concepts and visual ideas\\, new worlds\\, basicly just establishing the new lore - and most importantly -   they've killed Luke Skywalker. Pathetic.","true":true}
