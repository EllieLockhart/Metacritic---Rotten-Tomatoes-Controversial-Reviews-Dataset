Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am old enough to have watched the screening of  The return of the Jedi as a 7 year old kid\\, and all the ones that followed since. I liked TFA\\, Loved Rogue one and I have been blown away by the last Jedi. I went into the movie not expecting anything and apart from the very first announcing trailer I had watched or red nothing else. It pleasantly surprised me in every turn and I would like to thank the writers\\, the director and Disney for making it. This is my very first ever comment on a film\\, however I felt the need to make it as I do not agree with the negative reviews and I believe them to be unjust and misplaced. May the force be with you Carrie\\, always.","true":true}
