Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lifelong Star Wars fan I could give a long winded review of this film\\, but there are plenty of those out there that are far better written than anything I could come up with.  I saw this opening night with an extremely positive attitude. Despite my major problems with The Force Awakens\\, I was truly hoping for the best.  Maybe Rian Johnson could deliver us a truly amazing film.  Yes\\, these new films are about continuing the story of the new characters\\, but I have to be honest..my main excitement was to see Luke Skywalker again\\, a character so many of us had loved for years and decades and this was the film we had been waiting for.  Leaving the theater my genuine displeasure was downright crippling.  As a hardcore fan of the original trilogy as well as novels\\, comics and other media I can honestly say this is the most disappointing film in the franchise's history.  To be plain and straightforward the amount of bad outweighs the good by so much its astounding.  Yes there are some redeeming scenes in this film..but that does not make up for what I feel is a complete lackluster movie.  Disney doesn't seem to want to show these original characters that MADE Star Wars so beloved\\, the respect they deserve.  The ridiculously out of place humor and plot holes galore just add to the mess that is The Last Jedi.  I truly fear for the future of Star Wars\\, and that saddens me more than I can say.","true":true}
