Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Could have been amazing\\, but  Rain Johnson seemed to take all the setup from J.J. Abrams and just throw it away. The story seemed poorly written and there are constant plot holes. In the last 30 minutes I was hoping it would redeem itself\\, but felt it didn't quite do it\\, and the issues in the rest of the movie made it not a compelling or believable story.","true":true}
