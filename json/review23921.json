Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Makes you wish they never made any more movies. Some things are best left in your imagination. More about making money these days than making something that completes the story. Star wars is about a story of the Skywalker family & not about the effects. The beloved Luke we've adored for 40 years is turned into a crazy old man\\, just a legend\\, and really doesn't serve much purpose. Very cheesy parts & ridiculous dialogue. Only thing that never disappoints is John Williams. Cool things happen but not that much of a plot. The thing Lucas always did was made it about the intimate relationships of the cast & all about the story. Great stories\\, just like great melodies\\, never get old & live forever.","true":true}
