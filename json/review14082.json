Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"if you're going hoping for a Star Wars movie\\, prepare to be disappointed. This film is bad\\, the art style is very much not star wars\\, the space battles are probably the worst of the whole franchise. one part felt like it was trying to pull a B-17 (WW2) bomber run\\, they kept trying to force jokes down you're throat like it's a Seth MacFarlane film\\, and the story was just not good. I did like how they brought back the Yoda puppet\\, but\\, I did not like the Carrie Fisher floating through space crap (it's so bad it makes me angry). ","true":true}
