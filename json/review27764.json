{"101487":161845,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-24","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"People who gave this movies a top rating are either paid well to say so OR simple minded and don' t know the Star Wars.  HIstory will rate Phantom Menace as a better movie than Last Jedi.  Director was arrogant and ignorant on the way he made this movie.  Too many things didn't make sense in the movie like Luke being a whiny\\, grumpy old guy\\, Casino scene\\, & Snoke's easy death to name a few.\\nI'd go negative stars if I could.  The dishonesty of the RT professional reviewers obvious.","true":true}
