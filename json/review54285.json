Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I grew up watching and loving Star Wars. And I loved the direction that TLJ took. This movie took a direction with Luke that was certainly unexpected\\, but ultimately matured his character. Luke's view of the force in a post-Jedi world makes complete sense to me. The force is larger and more dynamic than the Jedi. In some ways Luke is the embodiment of the point that Yoda was trying to make to him.... \\\"Page-turners they were not.\\\" \\n\\nI also love that Rey really is a completely new character with no connection in heritage to those that came before. It's somewhat refreshing to think that the force is up to something new and different. Ergo the force-kid in the stables at the end.\\n\\nI'm excited to see how this vision of a new Star Wars plays out in episode IX. And for the haters\\, open your mind a bit to possibilities beyond your traditional view of the force\\, the light side and the dark side.","true":true}
