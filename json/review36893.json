Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was extremely disappointing. I was not a fan of the first either but felt that it was setting up a great story for the second movie. Instead\\, audiences received one of the most uninteresting plots Star Wars has ever seen. We were subjected to multiples hours of the most boring low speed intergalactic chase that anyone would ever care to see. The entire storyline with Finn turned out to be pointless as he fails to do the one job that his entire storyline centers around. And Finn\u2019s new romance is boring and was not developed well. Overall\\, very disappointed with this movie.","true":true}
