Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Never thought I would say this after spending hundreds of dollars in the past. But yeah - this was an awful shocker of a movie! And sadly\\, yes\\, I mean that in a bad way. True\\, and to be fair\\, it had the Star Wars polished shine. But that was about it. Dreadful characters. Poor story. Boring 'action' sequences. It actually felt mean and petty towards what defines star wars. I saw a Rian Johnson interview where he said he deliberately did this to create a subversive movie. WHY?? Why spend all that money on a popcorn franchise and then burn it down to the ground? What a senseless waste. How disrespectful can you get. I do wonder if people at Disney have lost their minds!? Anyway I highly doubt I will ever go and watch another star wars movie in my life now. You won't be getting any more of my money!!! Well done if that is what you wanted - because you sure achieved it.","true":true}
