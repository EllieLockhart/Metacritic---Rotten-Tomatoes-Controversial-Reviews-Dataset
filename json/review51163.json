Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely incredible\\, probably now my favourite in the whole series! The cinematography was absolutely jaw-dropping\\, and the storylines were super fresh and original\\, which was a real breath of fresh air after The Force Awakens. The battle scenes were amazing\\, and they created such perfect tension. An absolute must-see.","true":true}
