Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"failed to address the questions left from the last film with any satisfaction\\, effects were alarmingly bad at times and introduced new force powers that made no sense - like the ability to survive the vacuum of space without a suit whilst unconscious. complete disregard for basic science ... like the fact there's no gravity in space\\, meaning its not sci-fi - just pure fiction. the writing for the film is a joke (and since when did the big ships run on fuel?) sub plots were a joke and very lazy - heck they could even invent nifty space casino games and just used what youd see here on earth. somehow the ships shields cant be penetrated by a bigger ship if you're at a specific range...  disregarding the half dozen star destroyers who seem to think its cool to watch the main ship's weapons be ineffective against the smaller ship - when they could just go \\, close the gap and destroy it\\, but i guess that's inconvenient to the poorly written plot that lacked any real story. at least the phantom menace had a story - yeah it sucked but it wasn't as pointless as this film! the worst star wars film ever made.","true":true}
