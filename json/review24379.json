Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mixed feelings about this movie. A lot to love and a lot to be disappointed about. I think all the negative reviews and the extremely positive critic reviews are both too extreme. It was a good movie that falls in the middle of the pack of the 9 major movies.","true":true}
