Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a huge fan of Star Wars movies and to me this was an excellent entry to the lineup. It had emotion and build up\\, it had triumph and tragedy. I loved the action sequences and shouted for joy when the \\\"good guy\\\" found success. I loved the humor. I'm excited for more answers to come in the future.","true":true}
