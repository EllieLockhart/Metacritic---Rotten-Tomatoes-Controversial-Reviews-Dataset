Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Garbage film. A slap in the face and a middle finger to Star Wars fans. Everything that was set up in the previous film is just thrown away. The whole canto bite thing was a nothing-plot. The characters were garbage. Everything was a freaking gotcha moment\\, not plot-twists\\, just gotchas. Every moment that is supposed to be serious is ruined with misplaced humor. Everything that was set up in The Force Awakens is just thrown in the garbage. Also\\, don't get me started on freaking superman Leia.","true":true}
