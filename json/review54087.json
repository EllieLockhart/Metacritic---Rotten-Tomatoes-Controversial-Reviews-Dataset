Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't care about how visually stunning the movie is or how diverse the cast is or whatever\\, but nothing can justify an absolutely terrible story.  The social justice agenda brought Star Wars to a new low.  It's so sad to see a movie try to do something meaningful but absolutely fail at it.  Also\\, no one asked for those plot twists\\, not to mention that stupid frickin casino planet scene.  Jeez.  This movie as a movie is not as bad as the prequels were\\, but it's by far worse because of what was riding on it.  It's the next Star Wars movie man! Gosh.  Such a disappointment.  Definitely the worst Star Wars movie ever.","true":true}
