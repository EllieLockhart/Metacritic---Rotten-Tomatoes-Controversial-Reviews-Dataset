Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the quality of this movie was fanfiction... it answers nothing and accomplishes nothing. this movie destroyed star wars and the characters in it for me. no star wars fan can go and say the prequels are terrible movies and say this one was better because it isn't. i don't know what movie the critics on this site saw and how it gets a 92 percent positive rating on rotten tomatoes but the truth is it was a terrible movie. it destroys luke's character and has plot holes like the force awakens did but many more than the force awakens. leia can fly in space using the force and luke can project himself across the galaxy with the force. star destroyers now have the capability to track you through hyperspace even though that should be impossible. what they did to luke's character in this movie was character assassination and it destroyed star wars. if you are a fan of luke don't go watch this movie because you will most likely hate it like i did. rey is a mary sue at least in combat because she is never challenged in a fight. the only time she has trouble is when snoke makes anakin's lightsaber fly away from her.","true":true}
