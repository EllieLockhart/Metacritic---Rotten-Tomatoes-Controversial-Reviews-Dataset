Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Even worse than the prequels\\, worse than The Force Awakens. This movie convinced me to never pay to go see a Disney backed Star Wars movie (Rogue One is the exception). I'll wait until they come onto a streaming service.","true":true}
