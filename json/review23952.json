Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Man\\, is it clear they had some of their talent completely misplaced. The visuals were largely amazing\\, but the plot and acting were outright dismal at parts. It felt like it couldn't decide if it was Star Wars or Pirates of the Caribbean. Fight choreography was pretty good\\, though.","true":true}
