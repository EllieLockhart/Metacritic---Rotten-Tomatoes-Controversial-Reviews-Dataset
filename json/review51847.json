Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A fantastic sequel to one of the most tense episodes of the saga. While The force Awakens set the way and gave the fans what they wanted\\, The last Jedi set a new tone and explores even more Geroge's Lucas creation. It does not show more of the same\\, its all new. A boldly move\\, a fresh\\, funny and fantastic adventure. Star Wars from beginig to end.","true":true}
