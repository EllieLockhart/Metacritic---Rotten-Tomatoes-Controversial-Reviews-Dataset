Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What I love about storytelling is it\u2019s ability to be unpredictable. What I love about sequels is that it grabs characters you love and root for\\, and takes them into exciting new directions. This iteration of Star Wars does all of that really well. Star Wars today isn\u2019t meant to please those who grew up with the original trilogy. It\u2019s meant to take the franchise in an exciting new direction for the latest generation of kids to love. It ends up setting up a great end to the trilogy. However\\, there are a few jokes here and there that shouldn\u2019t be in this film.","true":true}
