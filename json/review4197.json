Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By far one of the worst Star Wars I've seen. Disney really messed this one up not even one lightsaber to lightsaber fight in the movie. This movie left me with not giving a crap about the storyline. Unbelievably disappointed way to mess it up Disney.","true":true}
