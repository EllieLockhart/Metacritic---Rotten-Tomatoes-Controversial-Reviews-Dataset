Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everything I wanted and more! So much more fresh\\, complex\\, and multifaceted than any Star Wars film. To me\\, truly\\, it is the best Star Wars to date. Perfectly balancing everything. Can\u2019t wait for IX!!!!!!!!!! Rey and Kylo though were the two stars and scene stealers of the film for me. Their dynamic and interactions were enigmatic and electric. Can\u2019t wait to see more of their dynamic played out in the next film. Goosebumps from seeing the film. Literally on the edge of my seat the whole time. Gonna see it again\\, 3\\, maybe 5 more times not lying.. \ud83d\udd25\ud83e\udd24\ud83d\ude0d GO SEE IT! MORE THAN ONCE. TO FULLY GRASP WHAT THE MOVIE IS AND TRYING TO DO. It\u2019s so much more complex\\, different\\, refreshing\\, and multifaceted. It\u2019s bigger than anything we can possibly imagine 100%!!! Have already seen it 3 times and plan to again once I get the chance :)","true":true}
