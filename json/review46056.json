Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning but the characters and story arch don't go anywhere and major choices made by the director really ended the trilogy for me. I'll watch the next movie but I don't feel any really excited for it which makes me so sad.","true":true}
