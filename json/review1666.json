Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a movie it was somewhat entertaining. As a Star Wars film it was terrible. Poorly researched lore and weak story in general. Wishy washy mess. When will the industry learn... They were handed gold and they screwed it up. You don't have to go after a new audience demographic when you already have multi generational fan base consisting of millions. We want quality\\, we've waited patiently keeping these films in our hearts for 4 decades all we want is a good well written storyline that fits an already established universe. Next time Disney wants to create another mess like this I hope they use a different name than Star wars so they dont further tarnish this story.","true":true}
