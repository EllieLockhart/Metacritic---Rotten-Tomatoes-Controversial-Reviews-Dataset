It might not be something that everybody hopes for but I think it has done what it has set out to do. It created an emotional story that emphasized seeing things from different perspectives\\, giving more dimensions to the characters. I have seen sequels that played it safe by forcing out unnatural or predictable plots just to expand the franchise\\, but Naughty Dog chose a path that not many dares to venture\\, a convincing and natural development of a story even though it's a risky one. Arguably there are many potential ideas for a sequel\\, but I doubt most of them will leave such an impression like the current sequel did. Still love the original main characters\\, it hurts to see one of them go\\, but I think it's well thought out and the ending didn't disappoint me personally.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
