Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"lazy solution to dealing with needing a new lead. About as innovative as having the main character wake to find it was all a dream. Luke's character deserved better. They'll make more movies and call them Star Wars but they aren't really. I just don't care about the new characters. Kylo ren is a joke as a big bad and Rey is meh and doesn't have enough cache as a character to carry the new movies. ","true":true}
