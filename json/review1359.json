Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A richly layered piece of storytelling that properly takes its time to develop characters yet moves us right long through deft twists after surprising turns.  I was fully satisfied with the answers to the questions left by TFA ... especially Rey's parentage.  The resolution of which makes her even more remarkable.  Have already seen this one twice on the opening weekend and will be back\\, again and again\\, to catch what I missed on the first go.  Have been Jedi Ready since day one: May 25\\, 1977 ... bring on Episode iX ... and I hope it is just as surprising and deeply satisfying.","true":true}
