Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a gut punch to all Star Wars fans. No part of this space movie belonged in the Star Wars universe. Yoda scene tact on\\, Leia as Superman in space\\, but the biggest atrocity was the treatment of Luke Skywalker. To think Luke from ROJ would even consider murdering someone in their sleep?!?! Discarding Anakin\u2019s light saber?! Killing him was Rian Johnson\u2019s final attempt to destroy everything the original trilogy built. - - Rogue One ended their movie with the memorable Vader scene which added to the Vader legend\\, but more importantly\\, made sense in the universe. Rian Johnson\u2019s complete disregard to Luke\u2019s iconic character couldn\u2019t have been more clear than the first scene Luke has\\, tossing his fathers light saber so carelessly. ","true":true}
