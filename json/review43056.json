Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This retarded fas talking a lot o of shit about the movie\\, its excellent\\, the best star wars ever\\, stop cry children\\, palpatine died in a very worst way than snoke retarded kids.","true":true}
