Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was magnificent! I'm not sure why its doing so poorly with audiences. I'd say its \\\"middle movie syndrome\\\". Empire Strikes Back is still the better middle movie but lots of surprises that keeps you thinking \\\"what just happened??\\\" The final movie will have a lot to wrap up but it has me very curious (and excited) to see how it all plays out.","true":true}
