Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson treats George Lucas' vision the same way Luke treats his old lightsaber after Rey hands it to him. Portraying Luke Skywalker as a coward who turns his back on the good vs evil fight is inexcusable. I'm trying to keep this spoiler-free...but every single action Luke makes is entirely out of character. And I'll never be able to unsee how Disney thinks Luke gets his milk... There is simply no way Johnson ever watched Episodes IV through VI. \\n\\nA blatantly diverse cast and a strongly implied lesbian relationship is not \\\"bold filmmaking.\\\" It's pandering. Incessant silly jokes in the midst of a final stand battle is simply insulting to an adult audience. An utter lack of a cliff-\\nhanger in the 2nd movie of a trilogy is mind boggling. Clearly Hollywood critics are terrified to defy Disney. \\n\\nThe antagonists don't have an ounce of the gravitas that Darth Vader and the Emperor wielded. And Rey is already more powerful than Luke ever shown on screen. So where's the dramatic tension? Why bother even going to see Episode IX?","true":true}
