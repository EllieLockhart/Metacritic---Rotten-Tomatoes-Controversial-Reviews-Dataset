Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was conflicted at first when I left the theatre. There were many very good things: First of all the amazing new cast\\, particularly Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley and a brilliant performance by Mark Hamill. Secondly the visuals were impressive and recognizable\\, and there were some great spaceship scenes. But unfortunately\\, this was quickly overshadowed by the deeply misguided steps that the movie has taken to make a \\\"new and fresh instalment\\\" in the Star Wars saga. Historically\\, these films had the adventure - the story - at the core\\, which has been replaced by both of the new films being written in tandem with movie artworks for what scenes \\\"we would like to see\\\" (the fans). The storytelling is clearly suffering from this\\, and in The Last Jedi in particular. The storyline is just weak and the few potential build-ups there are flops in favour of \\\"surprising\\\" twist. This is probably my key critique point\\, but unfortunately\\, it is far from over:\\n\\nSeveral potentials in the characters are wasted away; Snoke has been given a massive build-up in the previous movie - now a totally flat and uninteresting character. Luke's development totally not credible and out of sync with the character we knew. Rey's potential dropped on the ground.\\n\\nThis film is drenched in post-modern feminism that has no place at all. Ridiculous twists take place to deliver an opportunity to serve a moralizing\\, overly explicit statement and a raised gender finger. \\n\\nThe humor - even though it is occasionally funny - is misplaced and decimates characters to nothing. (I actually laughed during the prank call to General Hux\\, but while doing so hear myself beg  \\\"please dont do this\\, it ruins the characters credibility!\\\")\\n\\nI think they should have gone with George Lucas' story treatments. I must say I will be signing off the movies now\\, and stick to the prequels and original trilogy movies\\, as well as Rogue One\\, to preserve what I love about Star Wars","true":true}
