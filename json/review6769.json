Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don\u2019t listen to the naysayers - this movie is excellent! A thoughtful and fun ride through the essence of \u201cthe force\u201d with great new characters and worlds. Way better than early franchise films\\, I will be going to see this again. And again.
