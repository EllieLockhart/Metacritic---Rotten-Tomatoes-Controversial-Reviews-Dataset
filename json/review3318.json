Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Being a big fan since childhood\\, I was excited to see this new Star Wars movie. It definitely played shock and awe more so than I personally liked but overall was an excellent addition to the franchise. As times change\\, so does everything else\\, even Star Wars. Still overall good.","true":true}
