Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a good movie\\, I'm not sure why everyone is so against it. It did feel like the end\\, I'm not sure what there is left for the next film. It starts out slow but picks up in the end. ","true":true}
