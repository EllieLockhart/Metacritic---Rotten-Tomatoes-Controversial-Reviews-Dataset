Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Halfway through this movie I had no idea what to think. It felt awkward at times and slightly \u201coff\u201d for a Star Wars movie and there were even moments that reminded me of the queasy sensation I had watching the dreaded prequels. BUT by the end I was enthralled and the more I think about this film\\, the more I love it. I may need a second viewing to really come to terms with this new vision but anything this new and creative takes some getting used to. While \u201cForce Awakens\u201d was too safe and a predictable rehash of \u201cA New Hope\u201d\\, this movie has no real precedent and I hope that the upcoming Star Wars films continue to surprise and challenge.","true":true}
