Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't understand the critic consensus of \\\"delivering all the emotion-rich action fans could hope for\\\". It seemed to me that this film did exactly the opposite. Numerous points in this film seemed to abandon the lore of predecessors or present as unbelievable\\, strange or questionable turns of the plot. Many of the long time fans of the series left theatres with unanswered questions. How do you wholesale lose the confidence of the most faithful fan base in all science fiction fantasy? I think this should go down as the worst Star Wars film ever made and an example of how not to continue a franchise.","true":true}
