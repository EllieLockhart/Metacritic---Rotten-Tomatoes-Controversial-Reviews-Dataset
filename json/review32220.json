Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars by Disney has become a great sci fi line of movies\\, but NOT good Star Wars movies. The fact that they have slap stick humor and even the little bit of language that this movie contained make it have more of a guardians of the galaxy feel than a classic star wars film.","true":true}
