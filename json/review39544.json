Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was awful. There were too many plot holes. The characters were not believable and the film didn't flow. The acting was poor and there was very little character development and hence there was no reason to care about any of the characters. Thanks to Disney\\, I don't actually care what happens in episode 9. I'm done with star wars.","true":true}
