Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed the film from beginning to end. The opening shot after the crawl is iconic with a great scene in it. There are plenty of great moments that while this film has the tone of Empire Strikes Back and does have moments similar to previous films\\, but also as Luke says\\, \\\"This is not going to go the way you think.\\\" Nothing has been more true. Rian brings his own taste and I feel that the changes that make some fans feel like it's not Star Wars I feel are just changes made to the series to ensure the story as a whole connects. I highly recommend it to old and new Star Wars fans.","true":true}
