Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would never miss the latest Star Wars\\, though the narrative is again the same. This one has beautiful scenery and space fights interrupted by self-conscious speeches\\, making for an overly long flick. I like the new\\, young heroes and sensitive villain\\, and already look forward to the next installment. This is not a redefining SW experience\\, however\\, and increasingly feels like the video game tie-in they showed as trailer. Next\\, do it yourself Star Wars. ","true":true}
