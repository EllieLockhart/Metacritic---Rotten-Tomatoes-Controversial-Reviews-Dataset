Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked some things\\, I HATED others:\\n1. How they poorly kill Snoke \\n2. The poor character development of Rey\\n3. The whole character of Rose (who I found annoying af)\\n4. The absurd romance between Rose and Finn (wtf?)\\n5. The absurd implied romance between Rey and Poe (wtf??)\\n6. Why the need to create romances every time even when not needed at all?\\n7. Huge plot holes","true":true}
