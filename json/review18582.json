Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It looked good on the screen but the story was terrible\\, another emotionless hero death and this movie completely ignores much of episode 7 The Force Awakens. This movie is a huge disappointment to Star Wars fans everywhere. The story was bad and poorly told. The special effects were great except for once scene involving a certain princess..","true":true}
