Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sacrificing character development and plot for visual awe and tokenism\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi debases the saga's rich legacy while also pursuing a more political message.  The treatment of both iconic characters such as Luke Skywalker and newer characters such as Finn can be described in a word as abject. The introduction of new characters such as Holdo serves a similar purpose of paying lip service to diversity\\, while the treatment of fan favorite Admiral Ackbar is similar to how one might treat a mosquito in summer. Even protagonists such as Rey don't escape the film's brush of character regression. How does she become so powerful? Her parents? What about Snoke? Is he perhaps the worst movie villain of 2015-2017? Furthermore\\, the plot holes are too numerous to easily quantify.","true":true}
