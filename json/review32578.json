Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars the last Jedi is a beautiful well shot film with spectacular visuals and cgi compared to the other films. Thats the only thing that it has going for it. Star Wars the last Jedi didn't feel like a star wars movie. There are many plot holes in this film that I dont want to get into due to spoilers. The film tries to subvert our expectations but fails miserably. The last Jedi is a failure which is pretty funny considering that's the message of the film\\, failure is our greatest teacher. Well let's hope Disney learned from this one\\, which I doubt.","true":true}
