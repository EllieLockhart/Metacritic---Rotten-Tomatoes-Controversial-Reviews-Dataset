Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Enjoyable\\, it does actually feel like an old star wars movie (and not like one of the prequels) - however\\, as a woman\\, I'm not fond of the mary-sue issues with Rei. I would rather she be amazing because she worked hard to become so\\, rather than just being badass \\\"because we have to fill diversity quotas.\\\" Way to reinforce the idea that women can't be the leader without outrageous circumstances or hand-outs from other women already in power.","true":true}
