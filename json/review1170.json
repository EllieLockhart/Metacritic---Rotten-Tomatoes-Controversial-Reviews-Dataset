Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Apart from some pacing issues and a slightly bloated script\\, the Last Jedi rejuvenates the Star Wars story by doing what Star Wars does best: Exploring themes such the relationship between good and evil\\, heroism\\, and friendship\\, while offering an exciting romp through a fantastic landscape. The Last Jedi is the franchise taking an inward look at itself and realizing that the stories told are timeless\\, but at the same time each new foray is a reflection of our own experiences. This movie questions ideology and institutions that many hold sacred\\, and therefore is very divisive. Some of the action sequences require a suspension of disbelief\\, but that is nothing new to this franchise. Apart for the aforementioned editing and pacing\\, the film is well-produced and acted\\, and will leave your mind racing about many things when you leave the theater.","true":true}
