Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Could have been so much more than political tripe. Killing off Luke Skywalker was ridiculous\\, especially painting him as a coward\\, unforgivable. The writer clearly doesn't understand the franchise and Mark Hamill himself has expressed a dislike towards Luke's character in TLJ. Liberal morons have ruined yet another great movie. We get it\\, people in Hollywood are rapists\\, stop trying to \\\"teach\\\" us in movies because it's not US with the problem.","true":true}
