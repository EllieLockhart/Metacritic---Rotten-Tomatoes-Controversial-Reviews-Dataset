Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you actually thought this was a good Star Wars film then you're not an actual fan of the franchise and you don't know some of the most basic points to the Star Wars story. For Rey not to be of the Skywalker bloodline (and yes\\, I dont care that this is spoiled because it's a pretty rotten point and should be spoiled IMO) does not make a whole lot of sense when taking her unprecedented connection to the force into account. What seemed to take place was the fan base had a good idea that Rey was of Skywalker blood\\, and that Snoke may have been Darth Plagueis\\, and these may have in fact been where the story was going when we heard the franchise was getting another trilogy. However\\, these things were stripped for the sake of dodging predictability. Both of these ideas are miles ahead of what actually took place: Snoke is no one\\, and Rey is no one. You didn't even try to put any depth into this plot\\, Rian Johnson. This was 2 and a half hours of social justice propaganda. \\\"Rey\\, a woman from nothing\\, can do absolutely everything\\\" even if it means destroying the greatest film franchise humanity has ever known.
