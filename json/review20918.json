Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was disappointed that certain things didn't happen in the movie\\, but in the end I understand why the filmmakers did what they did. This film sets up Episode 9 to potentially close out the entire 9 episode saga in a BIG way! We now have NO CLUE where JJ Abrams will take Star Wars next!!","true":true}
