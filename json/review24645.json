Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie was a major disappointment to say the least! Characters were horrible and the story was bad! Too much CGI and dumb one liners! I felt like George Lucas\u2019 garbage movies!!!! Waste of time! Please JJ come back and save the franchise again!!!","true":true}
