We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The Last of Us Part II... a long awaited sequel for the fans!\rThis game is by far one of my favourites under graphics! Level of detail is amazing\\, animation to movements\\, details on terrain\\, clothes\\, weapons\\, you name it! It looks gorgeous! Everywhere you look is a piece of art so bonus points for that! Level design is also awesome!\rFor the story? Not so great. The writing is bad.\rThe fans have been wondering and theorizing on what's going to happen for our main characters for Joel and Ellie and other lovable characters during the first one. After long years of waiting... we get a revenge story that is not fulfilled.\rThe only best moments in the game by far is the flashbacks with young Ellie and Joel. Awesome moments and makes your heart warm.\rTo be honest\\, I really wish Joel should've got more play time... he died fairly quick during the beginning of the game.\rThe ending... oh that ending... what was the point of the whole game when it ends just like that... you don't get to kill Abby\\, you let her live\\, and go back home with two missing fingers with an abandoned farmhouse\\, played the guitar\\, had a flashback to Joel\\, leave and roll the credits. What was the point of all that? Abby KILLED Joel ffs! A lovable and badass character killed just like that. Ellie's drive on killing Abby is off the roof then her drive just switched off out of no where in the end... It almost as if this sequel was pointless.\r\rWould I recommend this game as a Last of Us fan? Nope.\r\rWould you buy this full price? Nah... buy it when it goes on a big sale or wait until PS+ makes it a free game in the future.\r\rIs this game gonna be Game of the Year? Absolutely not!\r\rFor hardcore Naughty Dog fans\\, I am truly sorry about this game. I can feel the huge disrespect in your face. A long awaited game is here and ends in a really horrible way.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
