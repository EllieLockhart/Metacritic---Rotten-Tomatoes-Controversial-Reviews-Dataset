Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just got back from seeing the movie in theater\\, and I was astonished at how bad this movie is. It's pretty tough to mess up a Star Wars movie; yet the characters\\, dialogue\\, and plot were all absolutely terrible\\, flat\\, and unentertaining. Hands down this is the worst Star Wars movie ever made\\, and the worst movie I've seen in theaters in a long long time. They're going to need to be some major changes before I even consider  wasting my money seeing a movie in this previously awesome franchise again.","true":true}
