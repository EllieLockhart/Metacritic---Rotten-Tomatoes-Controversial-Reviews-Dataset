{"101487":156877,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-28","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not answering much questions from the force awaken\\, adding even more questions actually\\, the last jedi has many unique twist\\, a boring subplot with Rose and Finn\\, and the romance between Rose and Finn is PAINFUL. The action scenes are exciting and its entertaining\\, but this doesnt feel like star wars as the original characters are pushed a little too much to the backline to focus on some great newer characters(Finn\\,Rey\\,Kylo) and focusing on terrible new charcters like Rose\\,Dj\\,Snoke and Captain Phasma","true":true}
