Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: Plot Holes Galore - Seriously\\, I love the IDEA of the Star Wars movies\\, but this was disjointed and rang hollow due to SO many superfluous plot lines and gaping plot holes. Incredibly frustrating to watch. Cinematically gorgeous\\, of course\\, but the story was so full of holes\\, it was hard to take it seriously.","true":true}
