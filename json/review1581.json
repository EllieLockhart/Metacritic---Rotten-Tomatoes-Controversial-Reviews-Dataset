Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lifelong Star Wars fan who grew up on the series\\, I can say that The Last Jedi is both the most divisive movie in the franchise and an incredible addition to it as well. I imagine it is what the Empire Strikes Back must have been like in that it completely does the unexpected time and time again. The Last Jedi certainly has flaws\\, but after seeing it several times and thinking on it at length\\, my humble opinion is that this is among the best Star Wars movies so far. A ton of fun\\, full of surprises\\, thrilling moments\\, many new directions for the series\\, and that familiar Star Wars quirkiness and humor we\u2019ve come to love.","true":true}
