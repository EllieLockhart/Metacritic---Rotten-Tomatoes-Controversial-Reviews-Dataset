Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it. It\u2019s definitely one of my favorites of the saga. Although people say it\u2019s horrible\\, I thought it was magnificently put together. Rian Johnson did such a great job with this movie\\, I would definitely go in to see it again for a 4th time","true":true}
