Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Half of this movie was great. The other half is at best mediocre. What's great about this movie is the character arc between Kylo Ren and Rey. The way they interacted and closely bonded in the first half of this movie reveals a lot about both Kylo and Rey as soon as we get near the end of this movie their bond takes a complete 180 and instead of making a risky decision they play it safe. If the movie went with the risky route this possibly could have been one of the best Star Wars movies of all time. Instead\\, like I said before\\, they play it safe in order to appease the average audience.They include a new creature called Porgs that is obviously put in to sell toys. The humor can at sometimes be awkward and there are moments with certain characters that are beyond ridiculous. I can sum up my review by asking a question. Was there an extremely impactful thing\/event that happened in this movie? The answer is no.","true":true}
