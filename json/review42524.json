Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was among one of the worst movies I have ever seen\\, frankly I think everyone should get their money back. As we were practically scammed into thinking we were watching something else.\\nThe plot was silly\\, the characters were bland. A beloved franchise with strong beliefs was ripped apart by the hypocrisy that is the motivation of these characters.","true":true}
