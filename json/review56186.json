Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Started off with a really good promise for a Star Wars movie I was begging to see\\, but in the end disappointed. Multiple viewings allowed me to see this movie for what it was: rushed\\, lazy\\, and over dramatic with absolutely no intelligent filmmaking. I wish that Rey's character was more developed\\, while instead being superfluous\\, invincible\\, and problematic. The final scene left me with a bad taste in my mouth. The whole logic of the hyperspace scene went against everything canon and showed the resistance as happy and hugging with full smiles\\, while their entire fleet was decimated moments before. I truly regret that this movie couldn't become what I wanted it to be. ","true":true}
