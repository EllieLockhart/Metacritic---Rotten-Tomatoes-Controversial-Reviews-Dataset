Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie will go down in cinematic history as the best\/worst example of what not to do with a middle film in a trilogy of movies with established series\/lore.\\n\\nDespite the fact this movie is visually stunning and sounds amazing the story was depressingly dull with no world building\\, no arc\\, no tension giving us characters\\nunbelievably stupid (especially if they were male) \\nwith cringe inducing comedy moments that systematically trashed any chance of drama. \\n\\nThe movie systematically either ruined or ignored all of the interesting questions and mysteries of the TFA and criminally shoe horned politics into the narrative at the expense of \\nstory at every given opportunity.\\n\\nRian Johnson took a giant dump on this franchise and I am astonished Disney let this slide. Easily the worse Star ars movie ever put to screen. The huge fallout and reduced\\nsales should be enough to let Disney officials understand that ths movie was not good enough. Star Wars is not bullet proof. Not good enough.","true":true}
