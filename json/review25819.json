{"101487":157279,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-30","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"****NOTE\\, HAVE TO CHANGE 1\/2 TO 1 STAR IN ORDER TO BE COUNTED IN REVIEW****\\n\\nSaw this movie with old friends who came to town. Some parts of the movie are good\\, but as many reviewers point out\\, the plot is swiss cheese and full of holes. Another aspect is the political SJW propoganda that just gets hammered over your head for an hour and a half.\\n\\nI'll break down the plot holes first ***spoiler allert***\\n\\nRight from the beginning we have Poe setting up their bomb squad to \\\"drop\\\" bombs onto the star ships. Only one problem: nothing \\\"drops\\\" in deep space. After that\\, the movie turns into a 2 hour long movie of a high speed car chase\\, except in star wars form. With the rebels trying to make an escape\\, Leia gets knocked out in an explosion\\, but somehow uses the force in space to \\\"mary poppins\\\" her way back into the ship\\, I guess she was trained in the force but never became a Jedi. Rest in peace Carrie Fisher\\, but she seemed weak in her acting role: slurring words\\, looking weak. I just find it hard to believe someone having a slurred speech can handle surviving empty space\\, a huge explosion\\, and then use the force because they are so \\\"strong\\\" to come back in. Then there is the time frame. Did the movie occur over 12 hours\\, 2 days\\, a week? It is very hard to tell\\, because there are no stars or planets to relate how long this car chase is taking. This is a key issue because at one point\\, Fin tries to make an escape\\, knowing that the management taking over for Leia is going to get everyone killed. As he tries to leave\\, this asian maintenance woman figures out his plan and tases him. Then she has a change of thought and they go on this secret mission. So here is where the timing is crucial. These two are in an escape pod\\, and they somehow travel to this far away casino place\\, go through their own ordeal\\, get captured\\, escape\\, then travel back to the ship that is trying to run away from the first order. IF they were able to run away in an escape pod\\, at what seems at light speed as well\\, then why the heck was the rest of the rebel ship not able to do similar? How long were they on this secret mission? 12 hours? A day? Again it is very hard to tell. The big bad sith lorde's death is insanely anticlimactic for a super villian we just barely got to see not in a hologram projection. Finally to top it off\\, almost all of the men had no real input into the plot development and were sidelined. Or they were just villains. Might as well not have had them in the movie. Even the asian maintenance lady somehow becomes an experienced pilot for some old school machines\\, And Rey masters jedi abilities in basically what seems like a day or two of being around Luke\\, where he did not even train her much. I'll end it on this\\, how old is chewbacca? He has to be like 70 years old\\, but looks the exact same. I have no idea why they have him there\\, he feels distant with no real back and forth between other characters besides the little pigeons he became friends with.\\n\\nNow onto the feminist SJW propoganda. ALL of the leadership roles are women. Literally a purple haired (insert feminist here) was a general and told Poe to stand down because Leia had demoted him. So what is her plan\\, because there must be something under all that purple hair and 110 lbs of pure feminist power?... AAAaaaand... wait for it... Nothing\\, for the entirety of the chase\\, they have no plan but to wait it out as the last remaining ships run out of fuel and consequently get blown up. I am fine with strong women roles\\, but literally every male character was just sidelined\\, belittled\\, and consequently irrelevant to the over all story and plot. As I point out\\, Fin and that girl had escaped on a pod and came back\\, so that was a viable answer to at least get a majority of forces escaped. Instead this \\\"General\\\" waits until the last minute\\, then sends the escape vessels down to a planet in an obvious move and gets half of the remaining forces blown up. It is at this point that she finally decides to reverse the ship and travel light speed into the First Order. So after the entire fleet is blown up\\, and they finally abandon ship and half of those people are blown up\\, she makes the \\\"brave\\\" decision to kamakaze into them at the last minute. Back on Chewbacca\\, another feminist SJW political point: eating meat is bad. Chewbacca basically gets shamed by these little creatures he is about to eat. So he feels bad and becomes friends with them. Two more things: as Fin tries to sacrifice himself to take out the death star cannon\\, he gets smacked out of the way by that maintenance lady who says we will beat them with \\\"love not hate\\\" and proceeds to kiss him. The thing here is usually the man goes in for a kiss\\, and so this is a socionorm that is trying to say to the audience \\\"hey look\\, women can be strong and make the first move\\\" but the reality is that this girl is not very attractive and you could tell Fin did not want it\\, and that the actor could not even portray that it was an organic moment. It seemed awkward\\, as they lay infront of walkers and huge ships litteraly a few hundred yards away\\, I think to myself \\\"why are they not getting blasted out of the ground? \\\" The last note is that Rey's abilities are wildly inaccurate. Some moments she seems at par with Kylo Ren in terms of the Force\\, and then other times she does not even know how to move a couple of rocks. Every other character who used the force had to train for YEARS and YEARS. Annekin\\, Yoda\\, Luke\\, even SAMUEL JACKSON!!! But i guess if you are Leia or Rey and you are a woman\\, you don't have to master anything and you just learn it in like two days.\\n\\nEpisode 7 was ok and had some problems\\, but at least there was character development and decent plot. This one was so all over the place that you have to be a die hard SW fan to ignore the complete flaws and obvious propaganda. This installment\\, episode 8\\, literally made not want to watch the next one until it comes out for free on the internet. Utter garbage. You look at the audience reviews and none of the starwars installments have gotten this low. So now that Han is dead\\, Luke is dead\\, and Leia will have a limmited performance cuz shes dead in real life\\, all we are left with is Rey and Kylo in what will most likely be the \\\"ultimate stand off\\\". Many of the exciting things we were looking to have happen were just utterly taken out from under the fan base: the sith lord's abilities and crazy fight (nope killed him off anticlimacticly)\\, Luke having an epic fight? (nope just pretends to fight as a distraction and then dies even though he is not there). One thing is for certain\\, the Franchise is officially Dead....","true":true}
