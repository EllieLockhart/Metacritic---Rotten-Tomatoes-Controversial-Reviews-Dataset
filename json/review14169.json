Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you were looking for something as good as Rogue One\\, you're going to be very disappointed. This is full of plot holes\\, gross political correctness\\, female power trips\\, and has been turned into a feminists dream film. This is my last Star Wars.","true":true}
