Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is full of cringeworthy moments that are unbecoming of a Star Wars film.  Development of characters introduced in The Force Awakens is nonexistent and their deaths are underwhelming.  Opportunities for potentially great scenes and dialogue are squandered and we are left with mediocrity instead.  Luke Skywalker is reduced from a wise\\, disciplined Jedi master to an emo\\, rude punk for most of his time on screen.  He is destructive not only of himself but also\\, not unlike the creators of this movie\\, destructive of the great tradition that came before.  New Star Wars does a great job of capturing the look of Star Wars\\, but a terrible job of imitating the feeling.  Other than one or two scenes per film\\, New Star Wars has no soul.","true":true}
