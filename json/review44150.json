Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To date this is the worst star wars movie i've seen\\, im a fan of the lore and i;ve read many books and in general im well acquainted with the universe and with whats considered canon right now\\, and they just murdered it\\, this movie makes very little sense for a fan\\, i wont covered all of that here but just know this problems go down to defining traits of characters and their actions\\, incredible plot holes\\, twist for the sake of twist that killed entire plot lines. in the end they stepped away from light and dark and focused on grey but instead of giving you a complex and rich new status quo they just create something bland that never really works","true":true}
