Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Gave this a rewatch and still hate it. First half is boring and not compelling. Second half is frustrating and angering. It\u2019s all stupid and bad. Literally every character in the next movie could die and I couldn\u2019t care","true":true}
