Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is an enjoyable popcorn flick with great action\\, incredible special effects\\, and some really touching moments. Slow in the middle\\, but the last hour is really good. But sadly\\, I am still not attached to the new characters like I was with Han\\, Luke and Leia. I find Finn annoying and a total waste in Last Jedi and Luke never leaves his rock (boring!). But overall I enjoyed the movie. Glad JJ Abrams is doing the next one!","true":true}
