Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Left the theater speechless. Saw it again and it helped me conclude that\\, The Last Jedi is the best Star Wars film in the saga. Daring and Risk-taking\\, Johnson takes the saga to the edge and crushed expectations. Anything can happen and I\u2019m curious for the end. Can\u2019t wait to see Star Wars IX","true":true}
