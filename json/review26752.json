Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of a kind in the Star Wars franchise. It\u2019s a unique and exciting movie with twists you won\u2019t see coming that will have you feeling every emotion possible. The uniqueness of it will be hard to take in at first (just how Empire Strikes Back was when it was released)\\, but this movie will go down as one of the greatest of all trilogies just like ESB.
