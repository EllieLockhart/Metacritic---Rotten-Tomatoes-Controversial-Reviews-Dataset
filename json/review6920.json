Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dumpster Fire of movie. Unbelievably bad. So much wrong no point in trying to detail. Bottom line is it will sell because fans in denial will buy tickets\\, which Disney will consider a success\\, so there will only be more crap movies to come with no regard for quality. Star Wars is dead. Truth is\\, it's been dead since 1999.","true":true}
