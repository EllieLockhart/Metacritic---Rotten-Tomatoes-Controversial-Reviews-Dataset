Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Technically good\\, but the story\\, the main thing you go for\\, it was the worst\\, no even didn't continue with the things poorly established on the force awakens if not destroy them.","true":true}
