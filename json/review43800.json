Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was utter crap; good to see all the special effects and it \\\"looked cool\\\" because of all the money they had to make this movie. But Rey is basically an infallible GOD character who can do anything that any other force user can do but 10\\,000x better. mLuke could life 3 3lb rocks perhaps; Rey can lift 100 1 ton rocks?? The Female-Badass movement for movies is bad and ruins plot development. Even Fin and his new girlfriend made no sense! They had no long lasting conflict with the New Order TOGETHER! Fin just woke up and eventually found a female mechanic. Then they spend time together trying to .... to save the crew... (no spoilers)\\, and it was no time at all! It was rushed and not well thought out! THEN LEI GOES FULL FORCE USER! Moving her body through space when she is dying.","true":true}
