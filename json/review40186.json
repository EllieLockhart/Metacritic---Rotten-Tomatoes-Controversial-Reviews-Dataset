Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not Star Wars anymore\\, take that ridiculous mask off!\\nI feel especially sorry for fans of TFA. That movie took a dump on what our beloved heroes achieved in the OT. The Last Jedi takes a dump on BOTH Lucas's original creation AND The Force Awakens. Absolutely abysmal.","true":true}
