Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If Force Awakens gave us the Star Wars that we wanted\\, Last Jedi gives us the Star Wars that we need. All those saying treatment of Skywalker is some kind of betrayal appear to have forgotten that in the first two fms\\, at least\\, he was a sulky\\, stroppy\\, moody and impetuous brat. Really not a stretch to see his character arc go in this direction when things don't go his way. Besides.... Did you see his final scenes here? That was ROTJ Luke back in full force... And then some. I'm old enough to have been a die-hard fan since '77 and I LOVED this movie.","true":true}
