Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Massive Disappointment. The Last Jedi Is Social Engineering Masquerading As A Movie\\, Disney agenda at his best\\, Propaganda comes backs every 10 seconds...\\, non stop merchandising introduction\\, bad acting\\, extremely bad direction....Disney has found in Rian jhonson the YEs man they needed to destroy this franchise...this movie is so so bad that i felt i had to protect my children from it.... IT IS THAT BAD...","true":true}
