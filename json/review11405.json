Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible!!  Huge plot holes and worthless\\, flat\\, boring characters from Rian Johnson.\\n\\nMy apologies to George Lucas!  I should not have criticized your prequels as they are 1000 times better than Rian Johnson's garbage of a movie.\\n\\nI spent 30 years fantasizing about what would happen with Luke Skywalker after Return of the Jedi; I can guarantee NO ONE will spend 30 years or even 30 minutes fantasizing about the future of 'Rose' or any of Johnson's lame-ass characters!!\\n\\nUnless Disney apologizes and fires Rian Johnson from any further SW movies\\, I'm done!!\\n\\nP.S.
