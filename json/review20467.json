Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a rabid and diehard fan of Lucasfilm since I first saw \\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\" at six years old. I am a huge admirer of the prequels. I adored the old Expanded Universe novels\\, comic books and games. I was very pleased with \\\"The Force Awakens\\\". All that said... \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" is my absolute favorite STAR WARS film of all time. Rian Johnson has directed the most bold and beautiful film since 1977's \\\"A New Hope\\\". This film deserves 5 stars\\, two thumbs up and 100% scores. I love this movie.","true":true}
