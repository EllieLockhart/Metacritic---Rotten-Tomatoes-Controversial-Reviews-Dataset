Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where does one start with this? For a quick summary\\, this is not well written. It feels more like a forced term paper written the night before without any clear understanding of the material.

Sound and visuals were good enough to bump it to one star..","true":true}
