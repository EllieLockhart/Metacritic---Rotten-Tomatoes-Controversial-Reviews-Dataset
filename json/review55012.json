Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was Star Wars so I loved it automatically before I even watched it. While watching The Last Jedi I was really surprised in many ways\\, I went in with no expectations and definitely saw and heard things that I didn't see coming. I must say that I was thoroughly impressed with Daisy Ridley and her ability to play the part of Rey so well. Tripped out on the scenes of Rey and Kylo and their force connection and felt like the force was being used in a way not quite seen before. Luke's part in this episode was amazing especially towards the end\\, he pretty much did one of the most impressive displays of using the force I've seen in any of the films. In many ways I think that this film was the best since the originals and did them justice.","true":true}
