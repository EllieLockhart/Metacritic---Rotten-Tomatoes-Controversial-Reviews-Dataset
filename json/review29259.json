Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Revised Review: After having a very different experience in my second viewing of this film\\, I felt it was necessary to update my original review. I'm keeping my original review posted below for reference\\, but for the most part I found that on a repeated viewing that many of my concerns were far overblown. I'm still bothered by them (hence 4 stars)\\, butt once I was past the initial annoyance with them they seemed very minimal next to all the things this movie did very well. Each of the main characters has a compelling arc that moves them away from who they were in the original film toward who the will need to be in the eventually conclusion to the trilogy. The performances draw us into the emotional journey of each of our heroes and help each story beat land. The transformation of each character helps draw them away from a more two-dimensional portrayal in The Force Awakens toward becoming characters with more depth. From a plot perspective\\, there are many things that are set up early in the film that pay off in a big way later in the film. What felt a bit loose on my first viewing suddenly felt very tight as I took in the richness of everything that was happening. Part of this richness is conveyed through performances that speak volumes even between lines of dialogue. Most importantly\\, this movie is tons of fun. There are several standout action segments that are grand in scale yet focused in execution\\, helping us pay attention to what is really driving the story even as the screen space is filled with chaos. Finally\\, there is a philosophical depth in this film that helps transcend earlier Star Wars tropes by adding context to why our heroes should be our heroes. It will be a controversial entry into the franchise for some time\\, but my sense is that over time it will become one of the most celebrated episodes in the saga for all that it dares to accomplish.\\n\\nOriginal Review: Star Wars: The Last Jedi was set up to be one of the most epic movies in the franchise\\, riding the momentum created by The Force Awakens and Rogue One. The result is unfortunately a peg (or several) below the quality of those films. Intriguing plot lines are intermingled with some questionable misadventures and an execution that feels tonally off. The sinister First Order comes off as a bunch of bumbling cowards rather than a dark power to be reckoned with. This issue is tied in with the general issue with comedy throughout the film. Levity is critical for the Star Wars formula and is handled very well in The Force Awakens and Rogue One. In The Last Jedi\\, too much of the film seems to be poking fun at itself\\, and many of the laughs have a slapstick\\, low-brow quality that felt a little more (dare I say it) like we saw in the Prequel films. In addition\\, many gags and jokes will date the film\\, rather than keep it as timeless as original trilogy. The story as a whole feels much looser and less cohesive than that presented by the best films in the franchise. We are told thinks we should be shown\\, and shown things we should be told (or at least shown in another way rather than just a cut to flashback sequence). We also spend several scenes with characters not at all related to the core plot\\, which is also not a storytelling device used in past films. Not enough attention was paid to telling the story the way that Star Wars stories have been told in the past\\, which sacrificed some of the spirit of the franchise. I applaud the effort to try something new\\, but I still think many critical things were lost. I missed the reverence for the originals shown by JJ Abrams and Gareth Edwards. The guard rails are still wide enough for creativity\\, but in this case I feel like they were ignored. This resulted in another Star Wars film that didn't feel fully like it belongs in the franchise.","true":true}
