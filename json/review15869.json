Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love the movie for what it give us and for what the future may hold in the Star wars universe now. The twists to the notions we thought would happen and does not\\, was great. If they are going to answer all our questions about Rey's parents and how Snoke came about get answered thru other venues; will be greatly appreciated. If you really like Star Wars\\, then go beyond the movies. Not everything has be Star Wars movies to be considered Star Wars. \\n\\nIf you keep your mind open to how we can get the answers we want\\, then look forward to the books\\, games\\, tv shows. That is a real Start Wars world in my opinion.\\n\\nOverall\\, this movie gave me the feeling I had the when I was 7 years old back in '78. Giddy. I am going to see a few more times and I look forward to EP IX.","true":true}
