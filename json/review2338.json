Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A truly great movie in many ways. I really enjoyed the deep psychology and the emotional depth. Also I felt that The Last Jedi had the intention not to be a super traditional SW-movie\\, but it tried to blend in both new and old stuff and it worked quite good. The journey and complexity of Kylo Ren a.k.a Ben Solo was one of the strongest elements of the movie in my experience. The battle he's in and tries to win is really interesting. I am very excited where his story and the saga as a whole will go to next.","true":true}
