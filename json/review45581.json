Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing movie. Disney has decided to rewrite and establish a different star wars universe\\, effectively erasing what it means to be Sith and Jedi. While artistically and beautifully shot (with many scenes stylistically giving homage to the original movies) good\/evil have been redefined from more obvious\\, cut\/dry\\, light\/dark to using your own discretion. It definitely does not \\\"honor the saga's rich legacy\\\" because it moves on from it\\, rather than continuing it.","true":true}
