Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was just ok. A lot happened but nothing happened. Im very dissatisfied but in the end if you approach it like it has nothing to do with star wars you won't be. Please do NOT let Rian do anything else with this franchise.","true":true}
