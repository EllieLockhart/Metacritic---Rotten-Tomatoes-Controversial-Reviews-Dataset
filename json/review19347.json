Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's one of the most funny and surprising movie I had seen. A new story\\, independent of all we know about saga\\, and this is the principal reason of loving and hate it. The fact of not follow original star wars comic story is one of it's biggest strengths","true":true}
