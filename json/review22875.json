Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Look at all of these people willing to look past HUGE plot holes\\, bad writing\\, and extremely forced humor during serious scenes. Are you guys kidding? Leia is now Superman? No backstory for the main antagonist??? This director really messed up a perfectly cooked dish with all the right ingredients that JJ Abrams provided. You fans will eat up anything that has the name Star Wars on it and ask for more... You sheep are exactly the reason Disney will be creating more touchy feel good Jedi movies from here on out. This movie\\, and I fear the ones to come\\, will forever have an antagonist problem.....","true":true}
