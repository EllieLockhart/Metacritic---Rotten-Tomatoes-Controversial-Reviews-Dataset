Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a big Star Wars fan and this movie was so bad then I decided to make account here just to leave this word of warning - they are killing Star Wars and ale its magic","true":true}
