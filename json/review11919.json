Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"HUGE let down. For all the monumental things that happened in the movie\\, it all felt so hollow\\, no meaning. Being a child of the original trilogy\\, I had so much hope for Luke\u2019s story arc\\, but it was complete let down. And don\u2019t even get me started on Snoke. ","true":true}
