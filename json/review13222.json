Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't understand. I just don't. I stepped out of the most exciting Star Wars movie I've seen since Empire Strikes Back. I was excited that this movie was out\\, contemplating the possibility of going to see it again\\, and then I started to see backlash against it\\, people calling it disappointing\\, a betrayal\\, people screaming that Disney had ruined Star Wars...\\nWhat is wrong with you people? When The Force Awakens came out\\, some people raged that it was too similar to the old movies\\, and they were asking for Disney's blood. Now that Rian Johnson offers something new\\, you're raging that it's not faithful to Star Wars? Make up your mind\\, already!\\nThe movie is good. It's a Star Wars movie. So\\, yes\\, it is over-the-top\\, sometimes\\, and it has moments of cheesiness\\, matched by moments one would find in the sacrosanct Episode IV and V\\, coming to think of it. \\nBut it is A GOOD MOVIE! What's more to ask for? I went in there\\, I spent two hours and a half in a seat\\, watching a movie. And I spent a GOOD two hours and a half. I laughed\\, I gasped\\, I was amazed.\\nI'm not saying people who didn't like it are wrong\\, but... I don't understand what they didn't like about it. If they didn't like this\\, what did they like in any other Star Wars movie? What were they expecting?\\nMoving on. \\nThe Last Jedi is a great opus to the saga\\, and it has reached my top three Star Wars movies. It has also reached my top three movies of the year.","true":true}
