Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Completely disconnected from the star wars universe that was established before hand. Sloppy and lazy writing are mixed with lame jokes to make a poisonous cocktail that cannot even be described as mediocre\\, it is just bad. The film goes off on so many pointless digressions and tangents that never pay off and are completely inconsequential to the plot. The two main villains are unceremoniously knocked off and Luke is completely relegated to nothing. If you are going to bank off of an already beloved and established franchise\\, at least have the decency to do some research on the source material. The director Rian Johnson even went so far as to say that he had not seen the previous film before writing his script. WOW. So to be expected the film reads like a half assed book report that was written after kind of reading the Star wars cliff notes. Please stop cranking out these weak movies Disney\\, you are diluting what was once such a beautiful universe into something that isn't even deserving of the title of mediocrity.","true":true}
