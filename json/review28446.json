Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pretty bad\\, *spoilers for the first few minutes* made the heroes lame\\, made the villians unimportant\\, made far too many barely hidden political commentary. The opening scene where they expect us to believe that Poe wouldn't just be shot almost immediately because the rebels are more than capable of calling the first order from their other ships\\, then expects us to believe he could destroy every gun on the ship by himself\\, then replace the Y-wing bombers present in both prior trilogies with big slow shuttle busses for thermal detonators. These terrible inconsistent scenes and uninspired story continues throughout\\, these are just problems with the first 10 minutes.","true":true}
