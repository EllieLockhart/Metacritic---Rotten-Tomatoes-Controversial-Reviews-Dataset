Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you keep everything the same thematically as they did with The Force Awakens\\, people get bent out of shape.  If you take a new path\\, as they did with The Last Jedi\\, people get bent out of shape\\,  Just go see the movie.  Let logic slide away because if you're complaining about TLJ not having a clear path\\, or that there are plot holes\\, keep in mind George did that with ALL SIX movies he oversaw.  This movie is entertaining.  It's a 2 1\/2 hour movie that feels like a 1 1\/2 hour movie.  Overthink it at your own peril.","true":true}
