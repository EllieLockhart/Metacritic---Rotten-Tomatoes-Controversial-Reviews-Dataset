Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful. The plot is so stupid that I hesitate to analyze the entire story. After an ill-conceived battle\/pyrrhic victory against the First Order\\, the \\\"RESISTANCE\\\" hopes that their literal plot armor can protect them long enough hatch an escape plan. The purple-haired Vice Admiral Holdo\\, who is ten times more annoying than Jar Jar Binks\\, devises a stupid plan to save her crew. The audience is told that it's a brilliant plan\\, despite the fact that it fails in the exact manner that you (and Poe) would expect it to. The Finn\/Rose subplot is a complete waste of time and only exists to undermine Holdo's brilliant (but actually moronic) plan through a flukish plot twist. Luke Skywalker is completely wasted. Ancient Jedi wisdom is treated with contempt\\, which is ironic\\, considering how terribly written this story is compared to any of the films in the original trilogy. The only reason to watch this movie is if you feel obligated to keep up with Star Wars. This franchise is nothing but an artistically bankrupt cash grab\\, informed by repugnant\\, hypocritical left wing identity politics.","true":true}
