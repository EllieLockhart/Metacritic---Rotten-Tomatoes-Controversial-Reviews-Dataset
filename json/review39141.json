Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This feels more like a parody of Star Wars than Star Wars itself. Cheap and unbashed humor\\, coupled with a complete lack of understanding of the Star Wars legacy breeds a monstrosity that's about as enjoyable as an enema with a flame thrower.","true":true}
