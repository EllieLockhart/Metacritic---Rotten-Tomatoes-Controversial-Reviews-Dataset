Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning is the only positive aspect of this movie.  I can't believe that as a lifelong fan I could hate a Star Wars movie\\, but here we are.  It seems to me that the New Trilogy\\, along with the new Clone Wars and Rebels series\\, is nothing more than a shameless money-grab by Disney. As a fan I do not take kindly to this reckless canonical revisionism and am especially upset about how Luke Skywalker's legacy was treated as little more than toilet paper. Shame on Disney and shame on you self-styled fans that enable them.","true":true}
