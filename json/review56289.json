Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Takes Star Wars in a bold new direction. There are minor niggles\\, for instance all of Rey's flashbacks in the first film were barely touched upon. But on the whole\\, the movie appeared to set out to subvert expectations -- the Finn subplot\\, Rey's training\\, Snoke... all of it was a very conscious attempt to disrupt the status quo in terms of the public's ideas about what Star Wars was about and where it was going. Of course that's going to be divisive and there are plenty of fans who wanted \\\"old familiar\\\" (were these the same fans\\, I wonder\\, who were saying Ep 7 was too similar to Ep 4?) but I enjoyed it. Well done Rian Johnson and I can't wait to see what your new Star Wars movies bring!","true":true}
