Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I guess I don't understand the venom from some people. I'm what you'd definitely consider a huge fan. (read all the books\\, etc)\\, and I loved it. Rian Johnson went some places I didn't think they'd go in this movie\\, and that's great. Guessing the people who felt it was too long also ripped Rogue One for not developing characters... Well\\, guess what? You need extra time to develop characters in huge action movies like they did in TLJ. Loved that there was a lot of Poe. Luke was amazing and so were Rey and Kylo. Loved the different creatures they intoduced. For me\\, perfect amount of laughs\\, big action moments\\, story telling and character development.","true":true}
