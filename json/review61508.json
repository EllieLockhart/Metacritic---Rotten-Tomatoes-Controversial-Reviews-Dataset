Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"First I want  to say I have played this game and its entirety\\, so this is my honest thoughts on the game.\r\rLikes:\r- The Graphics are amazing like we all new they would be.\r- The voice and Audio in the game is also amazing\r- animations are some of the best I've seen in recent years\rCons\r- They story leaves a lot to be desired ( I'll give more detail below)\r- Game play is the same from 2013 with a few tweaks here and there\r- For a story game it's extremely linear in how you play the story with no option of differentiation\r- Most Characters are dull and uninteresting i.e ( Abby\\, Lev\\, jesse\\, dina\\, owen\\, mel)\r- Game seems to force a lot of progressiveness all at once to the player\r- I had no urge to ever want to replay this game or even watch this game again.\r- Character development is almost non existent\r\rSummary: I don't want to sound like I'm ranting but this game was really awful to play and I don't say that because a MC died that I liked. I say that because the Story isn't fluid and jumps around to much between the characters Abby and Ellie. Furthermore the plot of this story is one of revenge which is fine if executed correctly. Unfortunately this story is not one of them\\, as your forced to play as a character that you\\, the player want to get revenge against. Then your forced feed flash backs of their life so that you can pity them which at this point is impossible because of who they killed just mins prior to playing them. Then when you switch back to the character you want to play as and start hunting down abby\\, they suddenly have a change of heart while killing them. Which leads to abby leaving and escaping victorious in her mission of revenge.\r\rND tried to be to complex and to progress with this story which I think bit them in the ass because the writing did not live up to anything. It left me as a player in a state of why did I spend money on this.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
