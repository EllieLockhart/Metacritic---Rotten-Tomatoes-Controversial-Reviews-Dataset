Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"More of a Marvel film than a Stars Wars film.  The story is messy and confusing and contains a substantial sub plot which is both useless and  detracts from what is actually interesting about the movie.\\n\\nUsually I think people overreact when talking about too much SJW concepts\\, but this film has several moments where they felt the need to make pointed statements about capitalism and animal cruelty.  It felt very jarring to have those in honestly.","true":true}
