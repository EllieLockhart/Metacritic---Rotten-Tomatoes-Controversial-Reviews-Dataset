Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was wonderful! Immediately after seeing it I just wanted to see it again. I am going to see it a second time tonight. The characters were well done\\, great acting\\, amazing visuals\\, great storyline\\, good plot twists (so glad I did not get any spoilers before I watched it). I am really impressed with what disney is doing with the Star Wars franchise. I enjoyed this more than The Force Awakens\\, which I very much loved. I grew up on Star Wars and saw Empire and Jedi in the theaters when they came out. I did not care much for episodes 1\\, 2\\, 3 but I am really loving these new movies and Last Jedi was wonderful. It is quite amazing how many people out there are hating on this. I wonder how much of that is troll-farm but I also know that it is impossible to please everyone. In any case\\, I consider myself to be a true fan\\, a believer in the force and I loved this movie!","true":true}
