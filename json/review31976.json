Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS AHEAD!!!\\n\\nGood lord\\, this movie is almost as bad as the prequels. WTH was that super forced love interest between Finn and Rose? Out of nowhere she's in love with him? That was as bad as the \\\"I won't lose my family again\\\" that El Diablo said in the end of Suicide Squad :P\\n\\nAlso\\, what was the purpose of that casino part? You could remove that entire part from the movie and it wouldn't make any difference.\\n\\nThere are so many things that they butchered! Who was Snoke? In the end he served no purpose to this new trilogy? So it turns out Rey's parents are just no ones?? All that suspense and expectations created on the first movie was for nothing??\\n\\nAnd again\\, I have to agree with the Mary Sue complains that some people had in TFW. So Yoda said that it was fine to destroy all the Jedi knowledge on those books because there's NOTHING Rey didn't know already?!?! WTF\\, she's someone that never had ANY Jedi training and she already knows everything that a Jedi is supposed to know??? Fuck this movie.","true":true}
