{"101487":181905,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-24","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a terrible movie\\, not worthy of being part of the Star Wars saga.\\nLet me start by saying that I am not a bot\\, and that I really liked the diverse cast of actors (also including many powerful female characters). People are trying to dismiss any critique to this movie using these arguments (e.g. any disgruntled fan is either a bot or a racist\/sexist)\\, but the truth is that TLJ's existential mistake was to completely disregard what a Star Wars movie is.\\nStar Wars is an epic space saga. It is built on heroes (the jedi) who represent and fight for the values that represent the best in our society. In TLJ\\, there are no heroes. Luke's character is butchered to the point that he's unrecognizable to anyone who has seen the first 6 movies. I can only agree with Mark Hamill here: I fundamentally disagree to the portrayal of Luke Skywalker in TLJ.\\nAnd Rey\\, the character who was supposed to carry on the torch of the Jedi\\, gets very little screen time beyond the scenes where she's pestering Luke. Her supposed \\\"jedi training\\\" consists of 3 short lessons! So\\, according to this movie\\, becoming a jedi takes less effort than passing a lousy online college class. No time is spent on going beyond the surface of her character\\, letting us know more about her personal journey. At this point\\, we simply know that she'll magically win any lightsaber fight without any training and without ever getting as much as a minor scratch.\\nFinn (a clown whose defining trait is cowardice) and Poe (who is active only in a short initial sequence) are not even worthy of being considered \\\"heroic\\\" characters. And what about the \\\"villains\\\"? The supposedly powerful Supreme Leader Snoke gets unceremoniously eliminated in a matter of minutes -no explanation is provided on who he is and where he came from. Kylo Ren continues to be the silly\\, moody teenager he was in The Force Awakens. These \\\"villains\\\" pale in comparison with the epic greatness of Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine!\\nThese flaws are so big\\, that I won't even venture in listing the numerous plot holes\\, inconsistencies\\, or plain boring scenes (who needed the whole casino subplot??).\\nTo sum it up: Star Wars is about epic adventures\\, great heroes\\, fearsome villains. The greatest of these heroes is Luke Skywalker. Not only Luke's character is terribly distorted in this movie\\, but there's no other hero that steps in to fill the void. Rey's story and personality are not developed any further than what (little) we saw in TFA. And on the villains side\\, we go from disappointingly shallow (Snoke) to utterly repetitive (Kylo \\\"teenage\\\" Ren).\\nI am incredibly disappointing in this movie. Seeing the next Star Wars movies is not a given anymore for me. Renovating the Star Wars saga should not be taken this lightly\\, Disney.","true":true}
