Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Seen it\\, wish I had hadn't. When graphics are the only thing you can compliment\\, you have a problem. Dont get me wrong\\, the actors did THEIR jobs\\, but the writers\\, E.producers and director(s) need to be taken in the night tied to a chair\\, and forced to watch the original movies\\, because CLEARLY they have not! Because if they had\\, they wouldve understood all the evil they were doing to thier own franchise. I personally will never see another star wars movie as long as DISNEY has control. Or that was directed by a child who was such a lame as a kid\\, he\/she never even seen star wars him\/her self. SMH. Pure trash!","true":true}
