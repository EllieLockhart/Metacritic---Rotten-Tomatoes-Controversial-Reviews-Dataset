Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a die-hard Star Wars fan\\, I wanted this movie to win in every way. And as a fan of Ryan Johnson's \\\"Looper\\,\\\" I was looking forward to a new and unexpected twist that would rival the reveal of Darth Vader as Luke's father. Instead\\, I was left with a visually stunning movie that felt flat and often silly. \\n\\nSpoilers ahead:\\n\\nThe downward slide began when Luke tossed his lightsaber nonchalantly over his shoulder in K2SO fashion. This was the moment that Episode VII so beautifully prepared for us\\, and this lightsaber\\, along with many other mysteries such as Rey's parents and Snoke's identity\\, felt thrown away as the minutes passed by.\\n\\nOther moments that felt completely false were Leiah's force moment\\, the reversal of Poe's mutiny\\, most of the time in the casino city\\, and the seemingly useless slide into the dark hole on the island.\\n\\nWhile the costume and environment designs were amazing and I loved the concept of the red-soiled planet\\, the gaping plot holes and lack of meaningful character development made this one of my least favorite movies in the Star Wars saga to date.","true":true}
