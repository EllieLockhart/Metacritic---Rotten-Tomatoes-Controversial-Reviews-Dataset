Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie focuses so much on subverting expectations that it loses focus of what makes a story exciting and well written. I also have to say that I love Rian Johnson\u2019s other films\\, but those are mostly stand alone films. I feel he focused more on fitting everything into this movie that he could rather than the franchises story as a whole. It seems he didn\u2019t realize that over a series of movies this long\\, there needs to be slow builds\\, with payoffs that feel rewarding and not rushed. I don\u2019t feel he\u2019s provided any set up or anticipation for episode 9\\, and definitely didn\u2019t build on those set up in episode 7.","true":true}
