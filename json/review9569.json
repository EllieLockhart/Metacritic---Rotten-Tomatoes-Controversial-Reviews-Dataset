Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good grief. What did I just watch? Let me start off by saying Im a huge star wars fan for 34 years. My 1st born son (now 6 years old) is named Luke\\, after my hero. My fondest memory is when my father took me to see Return of the Jedi when I was 9 years old. I watched every movie hundreds of times. I got my children into star wars. Their favorites are empire and return of jedi. I loved force awakens. I loved rogue one\\, especially the last 2 minutes. The Last Jedi doesnt even seem like a star wars movie. I don't know what the heck I just watched. Hologram Luke. Superman Leia. Dumb jokes every 5 minutes. It was awful. It kills me too say this because I'm such a huge fan.","true":true}
