Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All though not a bad popcorn movie  it did however loose  the feel of a starwars movie.The atempt at  sprinkling humor throughout the film made the scenes feel like a parody on a par with the 1987 movie spaceballs those scenes would of been better suited for  bluray in a deleted scene section as they came very close to mockery.there was also parts it felt they unnecessarily needed to explain or justify parts of the movie or characters.i got the impression that the writers read the reviews or had personal issues with the force awakens then thought ah we'll Address that in this movie\\,why is kylo Ren  wearing a mask as one example it the  characters and storey lines of the previous starwars movies are weakened by watching this film","true":true}
