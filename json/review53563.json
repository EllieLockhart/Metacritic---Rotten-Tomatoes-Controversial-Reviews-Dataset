Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Excellent movie\\, was thrilled to see Johnson's creativity and willingness to take risks.  The way he toyed with expectations\\, use of frequent humor\\, and lovely cinematography were likewise welcome.  His discussion of The Force and portrayals of it were intriguing.  \\n\\n  I understand that his Luke Skywalker disappointed many fans with lack of additional red meat\\, but having an all powerful Luke would make the movies- along with the development of Rey and Ren- meaningless\\, also generate problems with why he left in the first place\\, and furthermore render the movies predictable and boring.  Regarding Kylo Ren\\, I far more thoroughly enjoyed his character development this movie\\, as well as a much more realistic version of Rey. \\n\\n  As a fan of the movies\\, it delivered what I had wanted.  Was it absolutely perfect?  No.  Was it the best Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back?  Possibly\\, I'd like to give this film more viewing and time before a more thorough comparison and evaluation can be made.  However\\, I desired a movie that took risks\\, particularly after The Force Awakens\\, which was little more than a rehash of the original Star Wars (A New Hope).  It was also very welcome to have a movie with an extended space battle and space sequence that was satisfying\\, as I had felt that the prequels did not deliver in that department\\, even though Episode III did exhibit many other strengths.","true":true}
