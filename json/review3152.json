Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Basically it's Empure and ROTJ all rolled into one. And by that I mean the director has lifted Luke's story arc from those films and have replaced him with Rey. Right down to an almost word for word conversation in the elevator to go meet snoke. \\nLuke's character has been butchered. His actions go against everything Luke stood for in the first films. \\nThere is nothing original in this film\\, it's not as funny or as well written as Rogue One and is possibly the worst in the franchise. And I include the prequels in that statement.","true":true}
