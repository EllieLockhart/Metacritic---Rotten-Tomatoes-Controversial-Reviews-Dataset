Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not sure what people were expecting. Last Jedi is a great movie with some standout Star Wars moments. I loved it. Think it will get better with repeated viewing. Great pacing\\, great performances. The humor was a bit much sometimes. This movie took chances and moved the saga forward.","true":true}
