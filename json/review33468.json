Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible and tone deaf. Ignores anyone that is a fan of the originals while pushing a progressive narrative that falls completely flat. We are taken on a romp that does nothing and accomplishes nothing. This is not my Star Wars.","true":true}
