Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Walked out of the cinema thinking \\\"Is there something wrong with me?! Either I'm mad\\, or the critics are mad!\\\" \\n\\nNow I see I'm perfectly sane as the vast majority hated this film as much as me. \\nCritics are just doing the \\\"emperor's new clothes\\\" thing:  Saying things that are blatantly false and hoping the \\\"herd mentality\\\" kicks in.","true":true}
