Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"MILD SPOILERS!!! As a HUGE fan of the Star Wars saga for entire life (and I've been around for every installment) I thought The Last Jedi\\, as a film\\, was one of the best ever made. There were some genuine surprises (which is hard to do these days) and great performances (particularly from Mark Hammil and Adam Driver). As a child\\, Luke Skywalker was MY GUY. I read an article about the movie which said he \\\"wasn't just my hero\\, he was THE hero of my generation\\\" and I could not agree more. If you fall in this category like me\\, I can understand why you left this film a little conflicted\\, I certainly did. I was also disappointed with how severely they under utilized Finn\\, one of my favorite new characters as well as the Rose character\\, who I felt was poorly acted\/written and out of place. She was a central character who was difficult to care about. Overall\\, with time to reflect\\, the movie itself was great and moves the franchise forward\\, making Rey and Kylo Ren even more the focal point\\, as they should be now. I don't understand the backlash\\, great movie overall! Seeing it a 2nd time only reinforced this for me. I left feeling better about the movie overall and again only felt the Rose character and her scenes were the major flaws. Felt too much like the prequels and again Rose was just a really bad character.","true":true}
