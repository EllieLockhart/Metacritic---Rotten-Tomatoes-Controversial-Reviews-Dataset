Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie will thrill you. Then\\, days later\\, you will figure out it didn't like you. Yes\\, you wanted to like it. But perhaps it preferred the critics to the audience. Compare the critics score above to the audience score  -- it's 96% to 48% on Feb 18\\, 2018.\\n\\nAnd why? Because of two things: story and editing. Tokenism runs amuck. Love polygons abound. Characters act out of character. Everyone puts in a token appearance. Including the hero\\, Luke.\\n\\nMillions of people\\, maybe billions\\, waited upto 30 years for Luke Skywalker to return. And when he did\\, it was as a bitter old uncle who didn't want to spend time with family anymore. :)","true":true}
