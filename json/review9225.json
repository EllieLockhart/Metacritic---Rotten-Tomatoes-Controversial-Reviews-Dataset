Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Garbage. Full of plot holes. Destroys Luke as a character. Destroys basic logic as it applies to the series (ex if you can hyperdrive kamikaze a fleet\\, why not just do it with a big brick of lead with a hyperdrive instead of meeting for fleet battles? Or at least one of the other 2 cruisers you just let die for no reason?) All the evil characters were overly edgy incompetents rather than imposing enemies. Full of offbeat humor that felt completely out of place. Literally no redeeming qualities unless the only thing you care about in star wars is feminist power fantasies.","true":true}
