Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really miss the old Star Wars men. I love having a strong female as the lead\\, but felt the male characters were emasculated somehow. Kylo Ren should make men and women tremble before him\\, but he just comes off like a spoiled child throwing a tantrum. Luke is too old not to have it more together\\, and Poe and Finn seem more like teenagers than grown men. It wasn't terrible\\, but it should have been so much more.","true":true}
