Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not normally one to post reviews\\, but since the amount of hate this film is getting inconceivably rivals the prequels\\, there are some things to people who are ripping it as destruction of their childhood need to hear:\\n\\n1. Storytelling is a self-contained dramatic struggle that may or may not go the way you want it to. Enjoy the unexpected.\\n\\n2.Luke was not ruined or written out of character. He was complex: impulsive\\, ashamed\\, foolish\\, snarky\\, wise\\, courageous\\, sacrificial. All of these traits(sometimes in conflict) were motivated out of love for the people around him. Morality isn't a \\\"one and done\\\" act- it is a constant struggle. He has always been this character. He was never a one-note boy scout. I'm not sure what trilogy you remember perfect\\, Jesus Luke from\\, but it wasn't OT Star Wars.\\n\\n3. The movie was lovingly\/collaboratively made by a group of people who love star wars as much as you\\, theming was powerful\\, and it's awesome that they started expanding the SW universe to new worlds\/characters\/races\/further exploring the force. If you do not agree with this\\, please take the time to rewatch the Phantom Menace and you will see what a film that was not collaboratively crafted looks like(hint: it looks like trash).\\n\\n5. Thank Rian Johnson\\, for allowing both Kylo Ren and Rey(the dual protagonists as stated by the writer himself) their own agency in characterization\\, both from their predecessors and from each other.\\n \\n5. Nobody \\\"ruined your childhood\\\" If your life is so dependent on SW that a single movie ruined your childhood than you need to get a new life. Let the new kids enjoy their childhood and the themes that Star Wars offers them. At least they haven't built up 30+ years of possessive cynicism towards a family franchise that centers on forgiveness and hope.","true":true}
