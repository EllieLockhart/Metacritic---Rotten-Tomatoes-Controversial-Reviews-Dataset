Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi serves as an amazing sequel to The Force Awakens allowing audiences to finally see Luke have a decent part in a Star Wars movie after a long time. Committed performances are given by the whole cast and direction and script by Rian Johnson are both good and they both give the movie what it needs. This leads the way for more great Star Wars movies to come and gives audiences the action and twists they need.","true":true}
