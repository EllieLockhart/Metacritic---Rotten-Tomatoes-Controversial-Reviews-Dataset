Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know why some people are dissing this film. So many beautifully written scenes and an episodic film that finally thinks outside the box. Loved it. Well done. Rian Johnson and company.","true":true}
