Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film goes to show that reviews can be bought and Disney is now the real-life Galactic Empire of filmmaking. How critics rated this movie brilliant baffles me. The only emotions this film delivers is one of heartbreak and shock at what is being portrayed on screen. It's a slap in the face for all Star Wars fans intelligent enough to know a PC movie whenever the see one. THIS MOVIE SUCKED.","true":true}
