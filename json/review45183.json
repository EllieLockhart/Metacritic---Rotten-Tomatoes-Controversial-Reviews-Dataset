Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unlike any previous Star Wars film\\, The Last Jedi left me with an extreme range of emotions. Happiness\\, confusion\\, anger and sadness. It is a film worth watching\\, if only for the superb performances Adam Driver and Mark Hamill deliver. I could've done without some aspects though. Their attempt at lighthearted laugh-out-loud humor clashed with the otherwise dark tone of the story\\, the middle felt too long and I left with more questions unanswered than when I arrived. All in all\\, not a bad film. Rian Johnson took a risk with this one\\, and sometimes that's just what needs to be done. To fully process and understand the plot\\, this is definitely a film that needs 2 or 3 viewings.","true":true}
