All the characters feel fleshed out and realized and I found myself more attached to them than I care to admit. I think just for the game itself\\, disregarding the story\\, it would be unreasonable to give it less than an 8\/10.\r\rAs for the story\\, I know that it has been controversial\\, but I think it was incredible. They really get you to feel and empathize with every character as well as question many of the choices you've made throughout the game. There's one part where you are trying so hard to kill an unknown attacker and the whole fight is dragged out and difficult\\, but when you finally realize who the attacker is you feel conflicted about wanting to kill them. The story is hard-hitting\\, and for me\\, I think it was incredibly well constructed. I loved every minute of my time in this game.\r\rOverall\\, I'd say this was the best game I've ever played on the PS4. I think it deserves a 10\/10. I only wish I could play it again for the first time.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
