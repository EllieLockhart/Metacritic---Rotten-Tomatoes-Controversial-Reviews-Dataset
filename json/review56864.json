Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is so much dumb in this movie... most scenes were cringe worthy and had the pervasive taint of bad humour. while it is important to cultivate star wars into the heart of younger viewers\\, the poor plot lines and glaringly illogical decision making of the 'heroes' undermines the movie's appear to the adult audience. In short the movie lacks sufficient intelligence required to engage most viewers. Why cater to those watching the Teletubbies or Dora the Explorer\\, when it's not the right age demographic?","true":true}
