Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A fast paced and thoroughly enjoyable thrill ride. Plot holes\\, yes\\, but I was having too much fun to care. In the end I was rooting for the light side in the final battle and isn't that what it is all about? Giving the viewers a vested interest in the movies outcome?","true":true}
