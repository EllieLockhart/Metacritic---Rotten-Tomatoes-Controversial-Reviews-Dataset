Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I found the movie good not great. The direction that the director took the characters int this movie made me feel as if I was watching people I didn't know. It seemed as they took them in name only and used them and bent them to fit the director's ideas for this movie. The movie also had no \\\"I got you moments\\\" The moments in a movie that grab you and give you that feeling deep inside\\, this was flat and drab. pretty to look at times but very little substance. I hope J.J. can bring back the sole of the characters that this movie took away.","true":true}
