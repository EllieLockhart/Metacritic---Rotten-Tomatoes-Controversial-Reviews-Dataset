{"101487":187960,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-30","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a travesty and an insult to the fans\\, actors\\, and Star Wars itself. Anyone else enraged by how lousy The Last Jedi was\\, especially how they ruined Luke\\, devalued the Jedi\\, had the rebellion rendered impotent\\,pointless?  Edit\\nAlright. I am going to weigh in here. Saw the original Star Wars when it first came out in 1977. People needed someone to look up to\\, someone to admire\\, someone to inspire them to be better than they were. Luke Skywalker was one of those who did that. The character that we saw in this movie was NOT luke Skywalker. The people who made this movie did NOT know him. Who this guy was did not follow organically from what he had been before. It was nonsense. Kylo Ren is an inferior villain\\, an obnozious\\, petulant\\, pouty. brat. The proper reaction for Luke to have had was to realize that\\, realize one wins some and loses some\\, and that just as the light comes to balance the darkness so does the darkness come to balance the light. The proper response would then have been to organize\\, hunt him down\\, and neutralize him before he got together with the New Order.\\nNow\\, another thing that the creators of this film did wrong was to reduce the force of the resistance\/rebellion down to such a small number with only 1 ship that they are finished. The incompetence of the rebels demonstrated over 40 -60 years has been so great that they are not inspiring. Why bet on a sinking ship. A wise man would steer clear of them and not get involved despite the brutality of the empire. Yes\\, through improvisation and pure commitment they did in Rogue One and A New Hope and via Luke's powers take down the Death Star which was needful\\, and did again in ROTJ and did much the same thing in TFA. However\\, Finn and the Vietnamese chick should have insisted on getting the right guy to make the plan work (as the characters in Rogue One adapted to the changing exigencies of the mission and made it a success). Maz had a reason for that. \\nAlso\\, it does not make sense\\, in contrast to what pc egalitarian lower-class-pleasing bs states\\, to have such talented gifted heroic people come from anywhere. It hardly ever works like that. If you look into it these things do not come out of the blue. There are precedents for it\\, relations\\, training\\, contacts\\, study etc. Ren's parents could not have been nobodies. We need to know Snoke's backstory. Anakin's father must have been someone special\\, perhaps not in a great position\\, but superior.\\nOh\\, and I am angry this time\\, really angry and want revenge. Disney\\, Johnson\\, Kathleen Kennedy of Lucasfilm\\, and anyone else who put out this travesty\\, this outrage\\, this sacrilege\\, this insult to the fans\\, this destruction of the hero must pay. The way Luke tossed away the light-saber and how he and Yoda talked about destroying the Jedi legacy was UNACCEPTABLE. That was the height of insulting. The message Disney had was that they could insult the fans\\, destroy the heroes\\, throw away the implements\\, learning\\, and symbols of the Jedi as though they were valueless\\, give us all a kick in the teeth and still rip money out of people. Well fu Disney. I am going to find a way to make you pay. t\\nhttp:\/\/www.indiewire.com\/2017\/12\/star-wars-last-jedi-rian-johnson-mark-hamill-luke-ending-spoilers-1201908343\/?replytocom=1283989#respond","true":true}
