Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's Star Wars\\, so it gets half a star before even watching it. Kind of like putting your name on the SAT.  \\nThis film was a true disappointment. No respect for previous character development for Luke and Leia. The entire movie was one giant joke. If you go into this movie expecting to see a campy family friendly Disney film about space\\, prepare to be amazed! If you wanted to see a new Star Wars film.. sorry. This director has done for the Star Wars franchise what Tim Burton did for the batman franchise.","true":true}
