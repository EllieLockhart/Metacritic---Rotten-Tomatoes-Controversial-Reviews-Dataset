Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First i love Star wars been there from the start. Second i love Rian Johnson ( i love looper) The Last Jedi story was just Bad! The whole point of the movie was to kill off everything the Force Awakens built up. So many plot holes and nothing adds up story wise and only way you could make sense of it all is to throw your hands up and say poo happens and boy did it. Its a beautiful film to look at and has a few moments but the story just kills it.I so wanted to love Rey but the story makes me not care anymore. Kylo could of grown into a good villain but is all over the place. just a emo brat. That is where this movie is heading to a Kylo Rey showdown but this story makes me not care one bit.I will give Rian credit that i would have him film every star wars from here out. he did a wonderful job. As for writing ? no way in hell\\n\\nI Hear some people say they leave the movie not knowing what to think and have mixed emotions. For me i left with did Star wars just die for me? Yes it did. and that is just a sad thing to say.","true":true}
