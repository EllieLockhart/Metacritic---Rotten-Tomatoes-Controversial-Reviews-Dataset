Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was sooo excited to go see this.  Then I just sat there with my arms crossed\\, frustrated by what I was watching.  This had hints of being really great.  If an 30-45 minutes of edits had been done with would have been an exciting drama\\, adventure\\, fable to keep the Star Wars themes moving along.  I enjoyed the back and forth between Rey and Ben.  Even cranky Luke was fun.  But these characters were let down but stupid sub-plots and other characters being turned into boring jerks or completely irrelevant.   This film lacked focus and was so frustrating.  I do love Rey and want to see her story evolve.  She and Ben were the only saving moments for me.","true":true}
