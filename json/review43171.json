Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This script deviates way too far\\, cheapening the franchise. Whatever limits were set in previous films are broken. No longer do you have to be a well trained Jedi to use the Force in a super-human way. You simply only need to be born of a bloodline or be magically blessed. The film contradicts previous films and the end result is another silly Sci-Fi film that makes up the rules as the story evolves because the writers are too cheap to stay within the boundaries set by the original story-line.","true":true}
