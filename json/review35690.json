Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a smart and entertaining film that defies expectations in the most delightful way. \\n\\nThe newest addition to the Star Wars franchise thankfully avoids becoming a lazy cash-grab by Disney executives. Rather than lazily rehashing the same old\\, same old plot points from the original trilogy\\, the new film elevates the franchise by combining beloved characters\\, familiar themes\\, fresh plot twists\\, and new blood.","true":true}
