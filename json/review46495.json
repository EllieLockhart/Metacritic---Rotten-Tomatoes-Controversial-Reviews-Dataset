Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was very excited to see the movie\\, until it started. This movie could have has so much potential\\, but it lost it's way. Basically\\, it sucked. Too many things that didn't need to distract away from story line\\, and the story itself was not thoroughly thought through. These characters deserved more than the gibberish they had to go through.","true":true}
