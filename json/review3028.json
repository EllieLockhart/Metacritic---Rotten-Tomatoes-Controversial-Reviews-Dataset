Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bad no\\, very bad\\, it has no connection whatsoever with the previous one\\, everything the previous director did because of his eagerness to play a leading role\\, he does not know what TRILOGY means\\, it seems that he wanted to give his own ending to the saga\\, instead of give a continuation to the next movie\\, the starwars mythology is loaded\\, that the next movie is going to go\\, that's the big question. The prequels have more history than this.","true":true}
