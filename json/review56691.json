Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The longer I take time to think about this movie the more I become content with the overall movie. It wasn\u2019t what I wanted but it might be just what this franchise needed\\, something different. Although some of the plot lines had no payoff\\, they brought consequence to characters\u2019s actions\\, not every decision made can always be a good one. The direction this movie took might be just what this franchise needed to have an impactful ending with complex characters finally bringing to an end the Skywalker storyline.","true":true}
