Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was angry with Disney for dumping the expanded universe\\, however the new trilogy is going strong and I enjoyed the movie and would recommend this movie. I think it was a great fallow up to Star Wars: The Force Awakens.","true":true}
