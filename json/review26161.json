Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not really enjoyable\\, left me feeling flat and later annoyed. Can't believe Disney paid so much for this franchise to crap on on it. Your average animal breeder could tell them you don't buy a 4 billion dollar racehorse and ship it straight to the knackery.  I'm not sure anyone in the movie actually cared if they survived but I certainly didn't and I've lived and breathed Star Wars for 40 years. Even the prequels managed to not be boring.  They need to re brand this as the sequel to Spaceballs \\, then I'll give it 5 stars","true":true}
