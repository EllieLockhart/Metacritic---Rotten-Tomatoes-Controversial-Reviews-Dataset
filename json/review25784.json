Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a very good movie. It's centers around a ton of meaningless decisions and weird \\\"because of the force\\\" cop outs. It wasn't nearly as good as the last one. Honestly\\, I would rather rewatch episode I and II than rewatch this movie.","true":true}
