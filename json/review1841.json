Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A seriously shitty movie\\, unnecessarily long and boring. The storyline isn't focused\\, it's all over the place. They're ressurecting Star Wars characters with no justification. I've never facepalmed so much as during this movie.","true":true}
