Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Can't get this movie out of my mind\\, even after more than a month. Why? Not just because it is awful. Most bad movies are forgettable. Partly because it claims to be a Star Wars movie while it lacks almost every quality (except visuals and music) that made the original movies so powerful. But also because of the arrogant and clueless attitude of Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson. It sticks in my craw that they intentionally set out to destroy one of our few remaining positive cultural myths.\\n\\nI've run into people like this\\, and in my experience\\, they are so convinced of their superiority\\, they simply don't care what we lesser beings think about them or their work. What is ironic is that in fact they lack comprehension and competence. In this case\\, Kennedy and Johnson clearly don't understand the spirit of the Star Wars stories\\, or the value of the Hero's Quest as a timeless model for inspirational storytelling\\, or what makes movies good or bad\\, or what is funny versus what isn't. They are clueless. Which is partly why they are also incompetent. Johnson obviously can't construct a good plot\\, or solve any of the many puzzles that arise in creative work\\, without taking cheap or stupid shortcuts\\, resulting the countless plot holes and WTF moments that so people have listed. But since they see themselves as so vastly superior\\, they won't listen\\, or observe\\, or learn\\, and therefore they will never gain comprehension or competence.\\n\\nBut it is more than that. Since they can't create\\, they delude themselves into thinking that tearing down is the coolest\\, most up-to-date kind of creativity. \\\"Look how creative I am\\, I had the incredibly original idea of making the timeless hero Luke Skywalker into a cowardly jerk!\\\" Well\\, actually\\, Rian\\, you are a clueless incompetent. \\\"Look how creative and superior I am\\, I ditched all that outdated hero stuff and made a Star Wars movie about the political obsessions of twenty-first century American progressives!\\\" Sorry\\, Rian\\, the truth is you are a clueless incompetent.\\n\\nCreation - in this case creating new stories that grow organically out of the old stories and remain true to the existing Star Wars ethos - is very difficult. Destruction is easy. Disney has made it clear they are going to stay on the easy path and continue to rape their expensive little play thing. That doesn't sit well with me. But of course as I said\\, they couldn't care less. RIP Star Wars. Long live the Original Trilogy.","true":true}
