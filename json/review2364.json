Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At this point I've probably seen this film 15+ times. I just can't believe how good it is... It doesn't really follow a three act structure. There's an amazing action sequence to start the film and 3-4 shocking moments scattered throughout the movie. I don't want to spoil too much\\, but we get big answers about Rey's past and what caused Kylo to turn. That moment has left both student and teacher damaged. There's just so much to love here.","true":true}
