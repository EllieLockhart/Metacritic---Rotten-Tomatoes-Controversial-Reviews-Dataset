Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a disaster of story telling. It isn't true to the original characters identities we've been shown. Johnson goes out of his way to subvert audience expectations at the expense of the plot. It looks beautiful\\, it's shot wonderfully\\, and it sounds great. But this film like so many others\\, fails to remember that these features should play second string to well developed characters\\, arks\\, and story telling. When you have a good story\\, even a film with a low budget\\, like the original star wars trilogy\\, sticks in the our hearts and minds for decades. Last Jedi failed to do this in every way.","true":true}
