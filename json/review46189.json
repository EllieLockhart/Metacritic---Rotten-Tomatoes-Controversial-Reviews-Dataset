Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Walked out unsatisfied and was underwhelmed.  Rey only had one scene where she kicked tail.  Snoke turns out to be just some regular bad guy\\, nothing special in fact none of the back stories are all that interesting.  I guess Star Wars has lost its magic.","true":true}
