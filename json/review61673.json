The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I played the game\\, I didn\u2019t like the game\\, it didn\u2019t even feel like the same franchise as the first one. The first game shouldn\u2019t have gotten a sequel in the first place but here we are. The whole game Ellie plows through hundreds to kill Abby but yet when she actually reaches Abby she doesn\u2019t kill her? Why? To maintain her humanity? But she\u2019s been killed so many people how could she save her humanity by sparing one person\\, who has also killed tons of people. Abby is poorly written character\\, I don\u2019t hate her because she killed Joel or because shes buff\\, she\u2019s boring at best. She\u2019s a violent and sarcastic soldier who has a dark past ooh so original and true whole revenge is bad plot point was so dumb. OH did you know being selfish and killing purely out of self interest is bad??? EVERYONE KNOWS THAT. The game is so heavy handed and annoying it acts like it\u2019s telling a story that\u2019s better than it actually is. But I\u2019m gonna be real\\, I didn\u2019t completely hate the game\\, I like the graphics\\, the actors\\, and the music. The part exploring the downtown area to get gas was probably my favorite part of the game just because it was beautiful\\, has interesting dialogue every now and then\\, and had the Take on Me scene. Okay game but that\u2019s all I can say for it. Not a masterpiece by a long shot. If you want to play a game with great graphics\\, actors\\, characters\\, and writing with a morally gray character then play red dead redemption 2\\, not The Last of Us 2\u2026 Expand","true":true}
