Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not just a bad star wars movie\\, it's a bad movie period. The plot was terrible and all over the place. Most of the movie felt like a pointless money grab by Disney. This whole film is a major plot hole.","true":true}
