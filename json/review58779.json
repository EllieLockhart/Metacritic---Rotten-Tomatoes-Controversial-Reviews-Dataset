The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"*spoilers within* I absolutely loved this game\\, I am currently playing new game ++ and I still cannot get enough. The gameplay is\\, quite frankly\\, incredible and feels extremely realistic. Lots of new things have been added to help with stealth\\, getting around and combat. You can go go prone and hide under cars and in tall grass\\, lay trap mines and climb to use height as your advantage. Enemies are smarter than ever\\, they can surround you\\, use dogs to track you and use stealth to surprise you. It makes it even more challenging and exciting. The environment is absolutely gorgeous and the sound is just amazing\\, I cannot get enough of it. The infected have been greatly improved upon and are more terrifying and dangerous than ever. The infected boss battle is probably one of the most terrifying and exciting boss battles I have ever played and there is also a part where you have to make your way through a collapsed and dangerous hotel with infected growing into the wall. The story is completely different to the first one\\, there has been a lot of criticism (unfair I would say) of this\\, with some people getting to the first part\\, stopping and then **** about it on the internet. I admit\\, I was upset at the way the story was heading initially\\, however\\, I powered through and absolutely fell in love with it. There are very few games out there that let you play against the \u2018good guys\u2019 and grow to emphasise and even adore the villain. I use the words \u2018villain\u2019 and \u2018good guys\u2019 loosely here\\, no-one is a hero or villain in the last of us world\\, Joel did some terrible things\\, as has Ellie and so has Abby. There is one part in the game where you have to play as the villain and fight the \u2018good guy\u2019 who you have grown to love over the past two games. The concept is risky but I think it has really paid off here. All in all I\u2019d give the game a solid 10 out of 10.I cannot wait for factions 2 and hope to god there is a last of us part 3 at some point.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
