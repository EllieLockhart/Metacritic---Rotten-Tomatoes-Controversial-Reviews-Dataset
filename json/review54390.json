Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I honestly have no idea why people don't love this movie. I have to see it again\\, but it may well be my favourite one so far. That's saying a lot from a life-long Star Wars fan (as in dressed up as Leia for Halloween before Empire was even released). I really don't get people complaining about the jokes - do you not remember Han over the com in the Death Star \\\"How are you?\\\" or Yoda's \\\"Mine or I will help you not!\\\". Yoda finally looked like Yoda again and not some nightmare CGI version. Luke running away makes perfect sense (You are reckless!). Leia being able to pull herself back into the ship makes perfect sense - she was always strong in the Force. Think about Obi Wan & Yoda talking (that boy is our last hope - no\\, there is another). Plus we have no idea what type of training she did between trilogies. I loved the character development\\, the interplay between characters\\, and the action. There were only 2 things that disappointed me. One\\, they could have done so much more with Captain Phasma. Two\\, I'd like to know more about Snoke (although one of my friends has a very interesting theory about him). Otherwise\\, it was fantastic.","true":true}
