Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You know that feeling when something has been in your family home for generations and then your home gets sold and you watch someone taking it out to the trash? Yeah\\, that's how I feel after this movie.  Luke Skywalker\\, heir to possibly the greatest blood legacy in the galaxy\\, former last Jedi and now Jedi Master\\, becomes a whiny recluse because of 1 failed student and decides the Jedi should end\\, you know since Old Ben Kenobi (who also trained a failed student - Luke's Father) taught him nothing. It takes Yoda's little green ass to give him some perspective and he decides  he is going to die by using a fancy jedi trick to act as decoy for a total of 8 people (admittedly including a sister who we didn't realize until now was advanced in the ways of the force) to escape. As for Rey\\, the new Last jedi\\, apparently Jedi training (you know: lightsaber forms\\, levitating objects) no longer require formal lessons. If you have the force you just have to search your feelings and you can easily overcome a powerful Jedi Master.","true":true}
