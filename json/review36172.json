Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was exactly what you can ask from from a second movie of the third trilogy of this saga. It flawlessly called back the things we loved from the old films (think \\\"Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi\\\" and Puppet Yoda) while spending the necessary time to develop new characters (Poe\\, Rey\\, and most importantly Kylo Ren). They explored new powers of the Force (which\\, let's be honest\\, should have more to it than we already know) and took new twists and turns that we couldn't have expected. The emotion was raw and real\\, and without getting too caught up on needing to be like the originals or a few cheesy laughs\\, this episode is a rousing success than should be enjoyed over and over again.","true":true}
