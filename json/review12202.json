Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am blaming Disnay for hiring such inexperienced screen writer and producer as Rian Johnson for such big movie as Star Wars. I am really disappointed and sad. There is too many things like bad jokes\\, loose endings and unnecessary injections to this movie\\, that I just want it all be just a dream\\, and when I will wake up this movie wouldn't exist.","true":true}
