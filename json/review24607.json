Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie ruined everything that The Force Awakens was building up to. Concepts from the original films have been ruined. Many questions people had from TFA were left unanswered or were extremely dissatisfying. As a film\\, it is good. However as a Star Wars film\\, it is awful.","true":true}
