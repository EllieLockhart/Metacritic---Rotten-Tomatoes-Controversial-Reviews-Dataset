Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Star Wars franchise has been ruined by Disney. I hated the Force Awakens\\, so my expectations for this sequel were low. Arguably\\, it was better than the Force Awakens in many ways. there were some very cool scenes in this movie. However\\, the new characters are pointless and not worth rooting for. There is no continuity between JJ Abrahms and Rian Johnson\\, which makes things even more difficult to sit through. Nothing is explained well. there are stupid pointless moments throughout the film. Overall\\, it's a disgrace to true Star Wars fans.","true":true}
