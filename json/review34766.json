Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The directional changes are good ones. This movie does fulfill the story from TFA\\,  just not in the most expected ways.   Most importantly\\, it takes the opportunity to explore the murkiness between light and dark.  I fear that people freaking out about this movie aren't interested in the true nature of that dynamic at all.","true":true}
