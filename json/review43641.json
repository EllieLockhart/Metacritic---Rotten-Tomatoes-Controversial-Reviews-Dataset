Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was one of the worst Star Wars movies to date\\, up there with Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. Disney made a mistake. And fake reviews? These are real. I know so many people that share my dislike for this movie and anybody that says the audience score here is fake and the work of trolls are lying and are making excuses. The critics got this one wrong. But\\, give it a chance. Don't listen to me. Don't listen to anybody. This movie is split down the middle in popularity and you might like it. Hopefully Disney stops making excuses and Episode 9 and any future Star Wars movies are a lot better. For example; Rogue One. A SOLID Star Wars movie by Disney.","true":true}
