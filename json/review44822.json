Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Truly disappointed! WTH did I just watched ? Where's the sense of urgency ? Didn't feel anything really. The opening battle was already ridiculous. One X-wing that can disable all the 24 or 26 cannons on the Dreadnaught ? Was Poe really that much of a hotshot ? And all it took was one bomber to blow up the Dreadnaught (Also did they worked like bombdrops in WW2 and in space)? Did they find a flaw to the ship like the Deathstar ? Sure it's dramatic but it's really silly if u think about it. So actually only one bomber was needed and everything else was just cannon fodder eh? No shields ? Shouldn't these bombers be the super weapons of the rebellion ?  So the dogfights\\, plans and strategies in the older movies were essentially nothing coz all u need was one X-wing (with a hot shot pilot) and a bomber. ( And also a kamikaze cruiser) Starkiller ? Bombers should take care of it. All the needless filler' slow chase and Deus ex machina and BB8? I was surprised it wasn't BB8 who led the rebels out of the cave. I mean it can fix weapon systems and pilot an ATST. You might recall it was Chewie who was piloting the ATST in Return of the Jedi\\, so maybe BB8 could pilot the Millennium Falcon too? I could just go on. I am alright with changes and doing something different but please put in careful thoughts and don't be different for the sake of being different.","true":true}
