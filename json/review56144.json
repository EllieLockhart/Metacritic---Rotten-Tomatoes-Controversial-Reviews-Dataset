Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(Spoilers Ahead\\, go see the movie)\\n\\nThis was a phenomenal Star Wars movie. This movie was a roller coaster of wonderful Star Wars action! The story moved along well\\, blending the different story-lines together perfectly. There was a palpable sense of tension in the film as the situation abroad the Resistance cruiser got more and more desperate. The movie wove the themes of leadership\\, hope\\, and sacrifice together in an emotional tapestry. The Last Jedi played with the expectations of the audience from the opening crawl to the end credits. The characters teased certain details\\, only to keep them hidden\\,  but much was revealed. I loved the incredible space battle in the opening of the film\\, and then seeing Poe and Leia interact was intriguing\\, with her trying to groom the cocky young pilot for a larger leadership role in the Resistance. The stakes were raised as Finn and Rose went off on a long shot mission to save the doomed Resistance ship by finding a morally dubious code-breaker\\, who would later betray them. When DJ sold them out and the First Order ship began firing on the Resistance Pods\\, you felt the betrayal. Watching Luke train Rey was fun too\\, Mark Hamill is a phenomenal actor and his performance in this movie was a joy to watch. Luke Skywalker is such a sassmaster too\\, and he was a strong part of this film. The scenes with Rey and Kylo were great\\, and I think it is safe to say that they are either siblings or cousins and that Kylo was lying to Rey about her parents. The battle scene in Snoke's throne room was well choreographed. Finn and Rose infiltrating the Star Destroyer dressed in Imperial Garb was great\\, that gag never gets old and I love how large and incompetent the Empire is that this trick works. BB-8 is BB-great and seeing him man an Imperial Walker to wreck the hangar was fun. The Battle on Crait was well done and looked great with the red dust coming up from the white ground. The banter between the characters kept things light\\, even as the situations in the film grew desperate for the Heroes. John Williams was a genius and the score for this film may have been my favorite part. The Last Jedi brought fans an emotional\\, action-packed roller coaster of amazing Star Wars movie and I am happy to have seen it. The whole production team did a great job and I hope it gets the acclaim that it deserves.","true":true}
