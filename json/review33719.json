Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie. It's fun\\, but that's it. I'm a SW guy...5 years old in the theater with my Dad. You guys killed that whole vibe and history with this movie for so many fans. You tried to add Ana udience to the folks who would camp out on cold concrete for a show and now\\, you've alienated many of them. I loved Rose and Rey is awesome\\, but\\, she's not worth sacrififc9ng Luke's story for.","true":true}
