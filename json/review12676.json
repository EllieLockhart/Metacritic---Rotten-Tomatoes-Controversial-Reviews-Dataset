Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I could go on and on about all that's wrong with this movie\\, but I think enough people have already. This just isn't a bad \\\"Star Wars\\\" movie\\, it's a bad movie period. I loved every Star Wars movie that came before this\\, but The Last Jedi is an insult to anyone with a brain.","true":true}
