Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney has made another snarky MCU movie. They decided to turn the greatest Jedi ever into a pouty 4yr old. Rey and Kylo were the only bright spots. They brought back Phasma for absolutely no reason. BB-8 is the most intelligent being in the Galaxy who can drive an AT-ST...really? And force ghosts can now effect the real world....so all Jedi should die so they can rule the world","true":true}
