Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know what the critics are seeing.  It's as if they were blinded by hype and expectations or something. \\nBecause TLJ ruins the franchise by ignoring key issues and adding the wrong things.   \\n\\nWith director firings and a poor set up for Ep IX\\, I would recommend NOT to feed Disney money until they can correct things by bringing audiences a worthy Kenobi film.\\n\\nAnd it's not just internet \\\"trolls\\\" who hate this film btw.  I know that at my packed theater\\, nobody walked out happily and excited like they did Rogue One or TFA.  Instead\\, there was meh expressions and silence abroad.\\n\\n3\/10 for a 1.5 RT score.","true":true}
