Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved seeing Star Wars pushed in a new direction\\, although\\, it's sad to see it change at the expense of the old characters. But things need to move on and change with the times. I love how polarising this movie is. I'm even more curious to see what people will think of it in many\\, many years when we no longer have any fans who let steadfast opinions affect their feelings about the movie. 'Let the past die' indeed and move forward with complex\\, developed\\, new characters. Can't wait to see what happens in 9. Hopefully JJ won't ruin Rian's hard work in creating a new universe not rooted in past nostalgia\\, but one that gives worthy nods\\, occasionally\\, to its predecessors.","true":true}
