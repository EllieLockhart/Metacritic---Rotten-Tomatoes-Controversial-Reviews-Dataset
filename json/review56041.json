Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointed in this movie. It completely ruins Luke's legacy\\, which is what made me fall in love with the original trilogy. Kylo Ren is a completely pathetic villain and is as intimidating as a 5 year old throwing a temper tantrum because he didn't get the toy that he wanted at Christmas. The fact that he can't beat two people in a lightsaber duel that have never even wielded a lightsaber before is just simply ridiculous. The 3 new primary characters have the personalities of wet bags and don't have anything enduring about them. This movie was only slightly better than Phantom Menace\\,\\,\\,\\,and Phantom Menace had Jar Jar Binks in it. So what does that tell you? Not looking forward to the next episode at all.","true":true}
