Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I laughed so much during this film for all the wrong reasons! I honestly thought this was a comedy at first\\, such a joke of a star wars film! Disney is just shitting these turds out now\\, it seems. Not to mention they're probably paying the \\\"critics\\\" to give it favorable review. This film was shit unless you enjoy it as a farce. F U Disney\\, you PC\\, want to please everyone all the time POS. Note: I made an account on RT just to give this movie the half star it deserves!","true":true}
