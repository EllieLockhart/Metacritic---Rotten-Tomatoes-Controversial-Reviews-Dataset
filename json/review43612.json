Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This wasn't a movie\\, it was a sermon on social justice and a hate letter to white dudes who loved the original trilogy.\\n\\nThe performances from Ridley\\, Driver\\, Hamill were great. Boyega just is depicting a terribly bad character. Its hard to fault him. \\n\\nOne and a half stars only for the great acting. The story was garbage.","true":true}
