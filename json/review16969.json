Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I put off watching this flick for several months\\, giving me time to clear my head of all the negative gossip\\, because I really wanted to give \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" a fair shake.\\n\\nAlas. This film comes out of the gate badly and STAYS bad for the next two hours. They altered the Star Wars fanfare theme\\, which I noticed instantly; they immediately tried injecting Disneyesque humor; none of the characters are likable or even tolerable (including Luke and Leia); the plot never takes off\\, it's just one long chase; and the dialogue is abominable.\\n\\nThere's no other way to say it except to openly admit that this film is BORING. Whatever charm Star Wars once held decades ago is long\\, long dead\\, and it's not coming back (particularly under the guidance of Disney).\\n\\nI confess I even had a low opinion of the second trilogy\\, as it moved farther and farther away from the magic of the original. At least Episodes I thru III had a few saving graces.\\n\\nBut this third trilogy has ZERO redeeming value. It's like a shallow and insolent parody of Star Wars; and a very\\, very BAD parody\\, at that.","true":true}
