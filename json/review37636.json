Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is such a divisive audience for this film\\, so I wanted to contribute to raising this audience score up. I personally found The Last Jedi to be an exciting and original addition to the Star Wars series and the best addition since the original trilogy. The Last Jedi has a dark tone and takes some risks\\, with twists I was not expecting and encounters I didn't think would happen until Episode 9! Luke Skywalker is the best part of the film\\, and is actually extremely important to the plot and never feels thrown in. The only major issue that I found in the film is the subplot involving Finn and Rose\\, but the main story is so strong and captivating that I can forgive it.","true":true}
