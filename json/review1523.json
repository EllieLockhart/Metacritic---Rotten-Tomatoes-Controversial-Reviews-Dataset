Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a life long fan...I can say this movie is complete garbage!  I really don't recognize it as a Star Wars movie\\, but more of a cheap poorly written and imagined B movie!!! Rose and Finns side Story was useless. Luke Skywalker was reduced to man sitting on his pitty pot  and lacking any of the Strength\\, wisdom\\, and power that he should have. Cannon and Legends has made him to be a demi god almost which I think is fitting given his bloodline. Oh and they turned Luke into an attempted  child killer!? Reys parents are junkers and drunk!s? Wtf!? You build up to what could be an amazing villain in Snoke and he gets cut in half without effort? Really!? Honestly I watched fan theories that were more well written and thought out! Overall it's a HUGE FAIL. Good parts where\\, Leia using the force\\, Poetry got a little cooler\\, Kylo Ren got a wee bit cooler. Bottom line do not see this movie. It's crap.","true":true}
