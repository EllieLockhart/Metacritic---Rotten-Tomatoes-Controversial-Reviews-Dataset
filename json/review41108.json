Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had so many plot holes and was made to just make money and look cool. It threw away a lot of set up from the first film and was just not compelling at all. The characters were one-dimensional and the side quest with Finn and Rose could have been taken out completely; it had zero bearing on the plot. This is poor science fiction and story telling. I give this movie one alien boob out of four.","true":true}
