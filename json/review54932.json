Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's pathetic seeing a director on 24\/7 damage contr defending his horrid film against people that didn't like it.  The dude is going full retard. Just when he thought his career was starting\\, it's now being wrapped andup.  No wonder he's acting the way he is.  Now you have all these ball washing journalist coming to Johnson's side writing how he is putting all these salty fanboy haters in their place.  Lol\\, yeah right.  Johnson is terrified.  Johnson will never see his own Star Wars trilogy and Kathleen Kennedy will be shown the door either when the Solo film flops or when episode lX fails to meet expectations.  TLJ will perform around 1 billion worldwide below TFA. Blu-ray and dvd sales will perform the worst of any Star Wars film.  The toy line and other merchandise isn't rotting on the shelf.
