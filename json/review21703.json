Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just a poor film.\\nFelt bitty\\, disjointed and no real story.\\nTFA left me wanting answers- this film has left me not caring.\\nMy 7year old loved it- so disney have done their job.\\nRian Johnsons film just doesnt do anything for me- JJ Abrahams at least excited- left open questions and introduced new characters. Rians has left it closed and with no character progression- tried to be empire but with no real movement in story or character progression.\\nA real shame- i think disney took a gamble with Johnson- it didnt pay off.\\nGood luck to him- we all learn from our mistakes- and we all make mistakes.\\nThis has just hurt my view of star wars now.\\nNo real motivation or care for me to see episode 9.","true":true}
