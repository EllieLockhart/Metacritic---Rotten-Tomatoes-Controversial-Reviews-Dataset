Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From almost the opening scene\\, although not quite\\, as the light sabre goes humorously over shoulder the tone is set of throwing away as superfluous nothing the questions and foundations laid by the previous movie.  Literally or figertuivlry killed of\\, devaluing march of the previous offering\\, possibly legitimately but still it makes for an odd disconnect in what's meant to be a trilogy.\\n\\nAs for the film at moments it promises to be a superior entry learning from rogue one to add a tone of humour and reality\\, but at other times it dwells long and offers little\\, while lacking a strong central performance to hang itself on.
