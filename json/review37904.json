Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The script writing team didn't watch previous Star Wars movies. Star Wars have always had great menacing villains. Episode 1 to 6 was about Vader and Emperor and along the way they were always in a position of power. Here the sith lord Snoke dies like a bitch because he was not paying attention. The script writers also did not understand the character of Luke. He was turned into a grumpy old fool which shows the lack of care the script writers had for Star wars lore.\\n\\nCharacter building was sloppy and shallow. The story telling is not smooth. The escapade into the casino world felt really long and unnecessary. \\n\\nThe story didn't add anything to the overall lore. It was just a chase in space with some combat.","true":true}
