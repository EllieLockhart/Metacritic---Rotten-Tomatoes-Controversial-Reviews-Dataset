Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I LOVED IT! The older generation may have a problem with it\\, but I thought it was entertaining and exciting! It's beautifully captured and the actors did an amazing job\\, especially Adam and Daisy! Mark Hamill's performance was great! and watching Carrie say her lines was heartbreaking\\, knowing it's her last performance. GO watch for yourself!","true":true}
