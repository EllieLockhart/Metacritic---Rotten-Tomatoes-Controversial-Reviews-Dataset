I saw some negative feed back online the day it came out. I decided not read any reviews and generally tried to stay offline until I completed the  TLOUP2.

I saw some negative feed back online the day it came out. I decided not read any reviews and generally tried to stay offline until I completed the  TLOUP2. And I can happily say with my rose tinted glasses off that this game is a masterpiece. A true feat in story telling and gameplay mechanics. The characters are beautifully written and grow naturally as the story continues. Hats off to naughty dog as they\u2019re the bench mark for triple A games and modern story telling as a whole. 10\/10 from me. I generally can\u2019t wait for what naughty dog has installed next\\, if it\u2019s DLC for this game or a whole new IP you bet I\u2019ll be picking it up day 1 regardless.
