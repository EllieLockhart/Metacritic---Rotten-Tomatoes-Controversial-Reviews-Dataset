Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are so many things wrong in this movie.  Where do I even start?  Terrible.  Absolutely terrible.  I waited for 2 years with incredible anticipation and was utterly let down in almost everyway.  Luke tossing the light saber is really how I feel about this film.  Why is it everytime someone continues a film series they totally ruin it.  Unbelievable.  JJ Abrams has a history of ruining everything and as an executive producer on this film he continued his legacy.  Rian Johnson a Star Wars fan?  Really?  He destroyed Luke Skywalker.","true":true}
