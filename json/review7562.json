Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Every potentially powerful\\, emotional moment in the film completely drowned out by flat humour immediately afterwards. Horrible pacing and editing - some things just happen and others take up 45 minutes of the movie time to have no consequences at the end. Completely destroyed the lore of the original trilogy and Luke's character.\\n\\nThis isn't a star wars movie. It's a lazy attempt for a cash grab. I didn't get paid to write this review\\, unlike 90% of the critics calling it the best star wars movie to date.","true":true}
