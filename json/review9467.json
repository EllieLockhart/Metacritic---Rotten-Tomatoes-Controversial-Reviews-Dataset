Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good action but not enough to save it.  So disappointed that the writers didn\u00e2(TM)t love this franchise enough to do justice to the stories and characters. Truly a disappointing addition to a most beloved franchise.  Mark Hamill you did your absolute best with what you were given. Thank you for trying to save this movie. You were the only highlight.","true":true}
