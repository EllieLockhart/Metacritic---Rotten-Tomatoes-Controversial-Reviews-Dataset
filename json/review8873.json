Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For the life of me I can't understand why critics and news media outlets would be holding up this disaster as some kind of great success. I can only imagine its to defend the over the top progressive\/feminist elements of the movie. They have gone all out to defend this piece of trash film and have even said its low score is due to the \\\"alt-right\\\" leaving bad reviews... Question though\\, if the progressive elements are the only thing that half the audience hates then why does Game of Thrones do so well with the general public?","true":true}
