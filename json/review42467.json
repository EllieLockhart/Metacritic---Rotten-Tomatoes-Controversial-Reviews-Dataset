Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a huge disappointment filled with underdeveloped characters and pointless side plot. This movie that spans hours could have been cut to a 10 min star wars short film with meaningful content. I really felt like I wasted my time on this one. People seem to be trying to stretch really hard to find some underlying meaning to this movie but it was simply just a filler episode. Disney seems to have an agenda they are trying to push and it's overwhelming. with the very blatant \\\"Braun before brains\\\" take of every male character we care about\\, and simply obnoxious\\, power hungry female character. Not impressed.","true":true}
