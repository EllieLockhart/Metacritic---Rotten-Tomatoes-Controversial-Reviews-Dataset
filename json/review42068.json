Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie missed the mark on so many levels. There are a few nice visuals and sound design was good but the rest of the movie is absolutely atrocious. In my opinion this is the lowest point the Star Wars saga has ever reached (yes worse than the prequels).\\n\\nThe character development is terrible. They killed Luke's legacy with his ridiculous has-been\\, fearful\\, hermit storyline. Flying Leia was absolutely ridiculous. Rey the Mary Sue showed no reason to be able to do what she did (what training). Snoke... who\\, what\\, where from\\, how... none of those are answered. Finn was terribly used and ultimately inconsequential. Poe was made into a bumbling idiot after a strong showing in TFA. The entire plot is full of holes. None of the previous set-ups from TFA are given adequate pay-offs and some are ignored completely. The entire movie is poorly written and directed. As I said\\, worse than any other SW movie. There is very little redeemable value in this movie. If you really want to see it just wait for rental. This movie will make you miss George Lucas.","true":true}
