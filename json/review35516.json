Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi has some good moments but that makes the entire thing more disappointing. The direction taken with characters like Luke\\, Rey\\, Poe\\, Hux\\, and Finn are all disappointing. Canto Bight is probably the most boring sequence of the series. I can't say that I'm looking forward to Episode IX after this.","true":true}
