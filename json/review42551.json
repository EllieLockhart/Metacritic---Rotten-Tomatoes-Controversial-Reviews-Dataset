Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a pile of garbage. Filled with characters that you don't care about\\, drawn out boring plot lines that lead nowhere and stupid snarky comedy more befitting a cheesy commercial than a Star Wars movie. Disney also proceeds to defecate all over the legacy of the original films and show a version of Luke Skywalker that would not ever have come from George Lucas' universe. Avoid this film and all future Disney Star Wars. As Mark Hamill says\\, in Hollywood it's not important if it's high quality\\, only that it makes money.","true":true}
