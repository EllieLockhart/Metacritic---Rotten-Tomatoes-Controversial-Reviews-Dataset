Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As much as I liked some parts of this movie. I have to say this is the biggest piece of junk in the ST universe. With junk like this movie I cannot wait for George Lucas to write and produce a new generation of Sci-Fi movies. Perhaps on another Galaxy","true":true}
