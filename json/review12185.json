Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i am a star wars fan\\, and though i enjoyed Last Jedi\\, i feel it was a movie made for the masses. the characters we great\\, and the visuals were stunning\\, but the plot had some nonsensical story arcs\\, and the jokes were a bit forced and somewhat childish\\, and there were alot of them. Some of the science behind why star wars feels real they threw out the window\\, and the development of snoke and rey is a big let down","true":true}
