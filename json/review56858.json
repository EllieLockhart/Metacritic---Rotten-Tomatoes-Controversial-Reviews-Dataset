Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is no character relation between the calm jedi knight that destroyed the empire and the jedi master he was suposed to be. This movie makes it seem like the original triology was pointless. There is no empire defeat because the First Order rules. No rebellion win after the Endor battle\\, because its down to one lonely cruiser. Luke is not a hero\\, but a failure that runs away (seriously Luke Skywalker hides? Do we leave in the same planet\\, did you watch any of the originals Rian\\, this man sacrificed himself for the rebellion). Leia is the only character that retains her essence\\, but now seems to have amazing jedi powers. Rya Johnson was a kid with a hatchet hacking away any sense of acomplishment by our old heroes. RIP Star Wars\\, nice vissuals though.","true":true}
