Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Love it\\, even though the first 30 minutes got me worry where my favorite series was heading. It was satisfying. I loved to see old characters that i haven't seen in decades (Master Yoda). It was sad to see my favorite charecters (Luke\\, Leia) showed how merciless time is even in a galaxy far way\\, Overall the movie is amazing\\, Me and my family love it. Another great chapter to an amazing story that I started watching since I was 7 years old.","true":true}
