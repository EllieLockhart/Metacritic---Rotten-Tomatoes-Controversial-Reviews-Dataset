Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was horrendous. Most of the money for this movie must have gone to paying off critics or you threatening to shun them as racists and destroy their reputation if they reveals what utter garbage this movie was. Actually you must have threatened to murder them and their families and 10% of them decided that their lives and that of their families were not worth subjugating millions of now ex-fans to this 2.5 hour soul eating\/childhood obliterating pile of crap. For anyone that liked this movie\\, I hope you get cancer. For the critics that gave their lives trying to protect us from this steaming pile of crap\\, I mourn your death and applaud your moral integrity and selflessness. You shall be remembered.","true":true}
