Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spectacularly awesome entry into the Star Wars saga! I was enthralled by the original trilogy when I was a kid and this movie gives the same level of enjoyment as those movies. Some of the negative audience reviewers on rottentomatoes.com need to lighten up\\, these movies are space westerns\\, not a religion. Did my kids love this movie? Emphatically \\\"YES!\\\" We are going to go see it again 2 more times while it is in theaters. Great\\, great movie! Full of very powerful and emotional moments\\, made even more powerful with the passing of Carrie Fisher.","true":true}
