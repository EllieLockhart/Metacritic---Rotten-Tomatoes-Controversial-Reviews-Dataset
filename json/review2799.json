Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful movie start to finish. The storyline is ridiculous even for a star wars film. Parts of the film made absolutely no sense and the parts where u thought u were gonna get answers fall flat. I can't see how anyone could have enjoyed it","true":true}
