Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a bold\\, new\\, satisfying installment in the Star Wars galaxy of films. I had high hopes for the movie and was not disappointed. TLJ surprised me again and again\\, taking the characters and story in directions I didn't expect. After two viewings\\, I'm convinced there's more to this movie than meets the eye. The complaints of some people\\, in my opinion\\, reflect a superficial understanding of the movie. There is a message here about heroism and hope\\, love and sacrifice. I still think ESB is the best film in the whole series\\, but TLJ surpasses all the prequels and at least lives up to\\, and is perhaps even better than TFA.","true":true}
