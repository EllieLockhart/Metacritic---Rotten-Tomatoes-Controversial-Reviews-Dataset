Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi not only brought an emotional story but it brought an amazing franchise and honestly\\, this movie is amazing the action\\, the score\\, and the characters\\, were all amazing. And i can't wait to see what the end of the saga has in store! I definitely recommend you all go see The Last Jedi it's Amazing.","true":true}
