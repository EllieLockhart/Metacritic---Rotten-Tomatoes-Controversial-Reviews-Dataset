Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A director\\, and therefore a movie\\, that mistakes contrivance for originality. True Star Wars fans have a right to be angry. Nearly every critic's review I read claims that fans are essentially sulking because they are disappointed that the movie didn't give them what they wanted. In a way\\, they are right. True fans wanted a Star Wars movie\\, but that wasn't what Disney\\, Katherine Kennedy\\, or Rian Johnson delivered. What a waste.","true":true}
