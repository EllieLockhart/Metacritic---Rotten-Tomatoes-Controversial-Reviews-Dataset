{"101487":133567,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-26","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hate to say it\\, but The Last Jedi makes me miss George Lucas. He was a horrible director\/screenwriter but his ideas were very creative and interesting. This movie is creatively bankrupt. The scenes it steals from previous movies\\, we've all seen before. The Falcon flying through the Death Star (salt mines)\\, potentially interesting villains who we want to know more about getting killed off with no fan fair like maul and grievous (snoke\\, phantasma).    Silly anti-hero philosophy of listening to your boss and doing what you're told!   Fin is by no means a macho character. He is scared and fearful\\, but somehow musters the courage to save everyone by sacrificing himself\\, but a woman won't let him. However\\, a brauracratic purple haired lady decides to do the exact same thing\\, in the exact same movie and now its somehow ok.  Because women are brave and smart and men are hot-headed Neanderthals right?  These inconsistent overtones feel like they are the result of Star w ars having a political and social agenda. I believe this is the reason the \\\"critic\\\" reviews are so high. You can make a trash movie\\, but as long as the movie preaches the right dogma\\, the sycophant reviewers will lap it up. It's a sham. I'm going to identify the pro critics that were honest about this movie and will only respect their opinions going forward. Disney should get Paul Fieg to write and direct episode IX","true":true}
