Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Better than the prequels. Not as good as the originals nor it\u2019s predecessor or Rogue One. An entire side-quest irrelevant to the plot plus a space-resurrected Leia has me quoting Han Solo from TFA: \u201cThat\u2019s not how The Force works!\u201d","true":true}
