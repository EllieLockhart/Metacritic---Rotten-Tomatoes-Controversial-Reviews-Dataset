Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not unfun\\, and with some honestly extremely beautifully shot scenes\\, The last jedi falls on its face with its  average writing.\\nThe main subplot (or is it main plot?) is bloated and adds up to nothing other than some interesting but entirely unnecessary characters and conflicts. Of the newly introduced characters only one is mildly successful or interesting.\\n\\nThere is no disruption here\\, as safe\\, rushed and boring as episode 7 was\\, it set up a much larger universe that is entirely abandoned in order to return to the big sellable good vs evil skit. \\n\\nIf anything\\, the last jedi manages to push the series forward as a more manageable marketable product.","true":true}
