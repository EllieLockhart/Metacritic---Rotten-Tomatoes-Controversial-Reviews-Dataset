Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was sensational. I do not understand why there is so much hate for it. I see a lot of people expressing dislike towards the plot. To me\\, the plot was possibly the best of the Star Wars saga\\, if you don\u2019t agree I feel like you\u2019ve missed something. I\u2019m a Star Wars fan through and through and have been for years. This movie was just another sensational installment in the already iconic franchise. I believe the plot\\, effects\\, acting\\, and so much more were st the top of their game. Also\\, most longer movies leave me feeling dull at certain points\\, but I never felt that with this movie. The story was engaging and I never wanted it to end. On top of that it spoke a lot on a deeper level to the development of the characters. There were also several subversions to common tropes that were beautifully done. This movie felt more real\\, like an action that would happen if founded in reality. Stellar\\, truly a masterpiece.
