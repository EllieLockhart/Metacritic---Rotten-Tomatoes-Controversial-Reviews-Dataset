Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely appalling\\, what has become of respecting the past and the lore. This movie makes the Prequels look like Oscar winning efforts. While the press continues to fawn over another SJW failure\\, simply because it fits their agenda. The rest of us are forced to endure the complete destruction of a much beloved saga for POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY. This show has so many plot holes\\, it is sinking like the TITANIC. Did this Director and the Disney team not watch the original movies? Luke has been reduced to a sorry brow beaten recluse? This is the man who went after the 2nd most dangerous and evil member of the Empire\\, solely to turn Darth away from evil. And YOU morons at Disney took that character and turn him into a bitter old recluse. When it had already been established in lore that Jedi NEVER give up and NEVER quit. How is it that during the original Trilogy\\, Luke endured learning the force for most of three whole movies\\, AND Yet because of the blatant SJW agenda shoved into this movie\\, MARY SUE is instantly fully qualified needs nearly no training\\, and has bested Luke and Kylo in one on one combat? Please don't insult our intelligence. At the end of the day this trash was made solely for its ability to make Disney richer.","true":true}
