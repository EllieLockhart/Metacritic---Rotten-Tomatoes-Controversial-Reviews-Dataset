Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i am so angry that this was the last installment of Princess Leia. You could have cut sooo many scenes and characters that didnt further the story and made a decent length decent story movie. I did not like any of the new characters or creatures. None of the action scenes had action it was like my little brother choreographed them. I had to wait through half the credits to get the Carrie Fisher dedication??? that should have been #1!   and without posting spoilers\\, I literally wanted to scream\\, \\\"Chewie\\, EAT HIM!\\\"","true":true}
