Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Roam Johnson did something George Lucas couldn't never do: he made the Prequel trilogy look better. Let's see\\, what has Rian Johnson directed prior to this? Oh yeah\\, so there should be no surprise here. I did enjoy the short cameos from actual Star Wars characters and all the new\\, non-sensical things the force could do. I also enjoyed the really slow lightsaber duel. It helped that the participants forgot they could use the force during it. That really must've helped the target audience keep up! And at least they cast the First Order with a complete lack of diversity so the kids could walk away with a lesson.  Here's how I imagine the writing went: Rian Johnson: \\\"I bet I can insert the word meow into movie 50 times! Wait\\, hope\\, I mean the word hope!\\\"","true":true}
