Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the movie is horrible\\, the animation is horrible\\,  the acting is horrible and the script is horrible. ..way to kill a franchise Rian Johnson","true":true}
