Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I will admit there were parts that were not the greatest early on in the movie\\, however the last half of the movie was absolutely incredible.  I went into this movie hoping for something that was different than any Star Wars movie than before and I was pleased that it exceeded my expectations here.  While I came out of watching the previous 2 films for the first time unsure of how I felt about them in the franchise\\, I came out of TLJ incredibly happy and absolutely loving it.","true":true}
