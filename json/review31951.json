Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILER review This movie ruined my trust in Disney with the new Star Wars franchise. I grew up with the first three films. TFA gave me hope and Rogue One got me excited again but TLJ simply lost me. It only gets half star for Yoda burning the JEDI TREE since Disney made that a true metaphor for this film.","true":true}
