Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had high hopes for this movie but i was very disapointed\\, as a movie it kept me entertained\\,  but Starwars has high standards and this movie did not come close to meeting those standards. Much information was not explained such as who Snoke is\\, the Knights of Ren\\, or Ben Solos fall to the dark side. I also expected to see Luke fight like a true jedi as we saw in ROTJ we did not see that all.  I understad now why Mark Hamill disagreed with Ryan Johnson's idea for Luke Skywakers character\\, plus\\, there was no actual lightsaber battle  just Rey and Kylo fighting some guards that are way inferior then them. This movie is good for entertaining\\, but not good to be called a Starwars movie.","true":true}
