Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While not the best Star Wars film out there\\, The Last Jedi was a good film. It really shined in the character development for Poe\\, Finn\\, and Rey (the best parts of The Force Awakens\\, in my opinion). The new Star Wars films (including Rogue One) have had their greatest achievement be creating new\\, lovable characters about whom you can't help but want to know more. The new main character of this film\\, Rose\\, is no exception to this.  Her back story is well teased and her history with the First Order reminds the audience why the fight of the Resistance is so important. TLJ also had fantastic action sequences and great cinematography.\\n\\nNow for the less than great parts. The CG looked dated and made certain scenes difficult to believe (such as those in the casino). The gags felt a bit overdone and pulled me out of the film when they came up. They weren't outside the Star Wars wheelhouse by any means (the prequel films had plenty of gags\\, after all)\\, but these felt out of place in dramatic moments and a bit over the top. The film itself was a bit long and I found myself thinking \\\"this has to be the end\\, right?\\\" fairly often during the last 45 minutes. The non-action parts could drag on a bit\\, too. None of this made the movie unenjoyable. It's certainly not the worst Star Wars movie and\\, as a Star Wars movie\\, you'll get what you paid for should you choose to go see it (which you should). I have no regrets for the admission price of my IMAX ticket and I believe I'll see it for a second time sometime after Christmas.\\n\\nTL;DR: A decent entry of the Star Wars franchise with enjoyable fight scenes and character development. A bit long\\, but worth the ticket price.","true":true}
