Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite the CGI chase very reminiscent of the prequels for the other 2 hours and 20 minutes it was an edge of your seat\\, twists and turns movie. Opens the door to many things to help grow a universe Star Wars fans have wanted.","true":true}
