Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The critics got it right. Alas\\, this isn't fanwank like a lot here seem to want. This is a great\\, smart\\, fun\\, big-hearted movie full of flawed\\, human characters and clever twists. It's definitely Star Wars and there was clapping in the packed theatre when I saw it. Luke has a great arc -- he starts off jaded and rightfully so. Anyone complaining about SJW angles apparently hasn't seen all the other Star Wars movies. The best since the original.","true":true}
