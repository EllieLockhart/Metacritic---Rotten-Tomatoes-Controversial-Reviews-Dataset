Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not good. Visually wonderful and DRIVER gives a great performance but other than that? The movie doesn't really work. And the casino subplot is pointless I get what their trying to articulate but it made the movie 40 minutes longer for NO reason. Poe's plot is nonsensical as well. This film has good moments but that's all they are; moments. \\\"SALT?!?\\\" That was the stupidest moment I've seen in a main stream film in a LONG time","true":true}
