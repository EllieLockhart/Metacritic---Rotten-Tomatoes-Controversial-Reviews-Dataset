Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rose was an extremely cringe worthy character and combined with a movie halting plot offshoot that ended up being pointless\\, that was just unbearable. The humow was completely off the mark for a star wars film and ruined the intensity that makes these films great. The training of Rey was handled horribly\\, Ackbar was a major character that was killed without thought\\, phasma played no role\\, snoke was not explained\\, the casino scene felt like something from oceans 11 mixed with the hunger games that was no star wars esque in any manner\\, no two light sabers made contact in the entirety of the film.
