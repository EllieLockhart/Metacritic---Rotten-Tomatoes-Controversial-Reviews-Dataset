Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Star Wars The Last Jedi\\\" provides a new interesting take on the Star Wars saga  with unexpected twists\\, new characters and development on the characters we already know. The result is a fun ride full of emotions and incredible action sequences.","true":true}
