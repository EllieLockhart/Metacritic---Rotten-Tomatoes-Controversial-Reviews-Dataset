Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst star wars film I have seen so far even phantom menace is 10x better then this garbage\\, alot of bad acting so many lame jokes and cringey scenes leia coming back to life in outer space and doing a superman wtf was that about!? Whyyy?? Wtf was the point in snoke suppose to be all powerful just dies in the most simplest of ways don't even know anything about him? So many unnecessary things happening the plot was so pointless how did they get it so wrong!? I literally had no emotional attachment to any character they could of all died and I wouldn't of given a monkies. The only thing that was good was the cinematography so thats why I've given it 1 star instead of 1\/2 star but this is gonna go down as a stinker!","true":true}
