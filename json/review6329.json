Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney once again showed their inability to portray men as anything other than stupid buffoons. Fin is called a coward. Poe is made to be a short-sighted jock who can't understand more complex plans. Luke Skywalker becomes jaded and loses the kindness that is central to his character in three films. The Lucas Films intentionally portrayed strong male and female characters alongside each other in friendship.","true":true}
