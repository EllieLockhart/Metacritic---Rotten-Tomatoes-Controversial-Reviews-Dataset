Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How on earth could the critics have praised this movie? By far one of the worst Star Wars movies ever made\\, and by far the biggest let down. Critics said that this is the movie that fans wanted to see? Obviously the critics have no idea what a Star Wars movie should be. ","true":true}
