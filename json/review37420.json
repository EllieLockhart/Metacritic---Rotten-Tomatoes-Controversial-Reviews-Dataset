Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are a few good scenes in the movie. My issue with this movie was. The way Luke acted in this movie was very out of character. Killing of Snoke was a shocking moment I like how he died but we know nothing about his motives and his backstory. I think Rian Johnson thought the force awakens was to safe and he felt like I have to do most schoking he was afraid screw Star Wars ","true":true}
