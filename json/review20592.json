Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to like this movie\\, I did. But poor writing and underdevelopment for many of the characters left me cold. (Not to mention that Mary Poppins scene). What a waste of a franchise that looked to actually be headed in the right direction.","true":true}
