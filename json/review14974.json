Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just signed up for rottentomatoes.com to give this piece of garbage a 1\/2 rating. Whoever is responsible for this (obviously not the actors who did a reasonably good to outstanding job) should be ashamed of what they did to the Star Wars franchise out of greed. I spent the last third of the movie resisting the urge to leave the cinema screaming.","true":true}
