Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The greastest strength of this movie is that it does rely on itself. It takes us into a fascinating direction. I can not wait for what Mr Johnson has in store for us with the new trilogy","true":true}
