Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointed!  I couldn't get emotionally invested in this movie.  I wanted to be scared by the villains - I wasn't; I wanted to cheer for the heroes - I didn't.  None of the new characters (Holdo\\, Rose\\, Benecio del Toro) was exciting or interesting.  The pacing of the movie did not work well.  The gratuitous action scenes were boring.  Please bring back the master storytelling that makes a movie - not just a great Star Wars movie.","true":true}
