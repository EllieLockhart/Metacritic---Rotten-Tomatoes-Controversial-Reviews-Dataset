Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bad story\\, crappy characters. Ruined two of the five remaining characters. Snoak was a pointless character. Rian's political views had no purpose in Star Wars.  The last two Star Wars are dumb feminist grabbers. It's a shame that Disney would let this crap come out under their brand.","true":true}
