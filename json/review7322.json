Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Episode 8 Character Assassination. The more I analyze this movie the more angry I become at it. Never have I experienced a property that so callously dismisses and insults its source material. Disregarding the idiotic plot holes\\, obvious sjw political agendas\\, the treatment of the character of Luke Skywalker is enough to warrant a bad review. One more thing\\, the character of Rey IS a Mary Sue. Compare her character arc to that of Luke's\\, by the second film she has defeated a trained Jedi in Kylo\\, mastered the Jedi mind trick\\, mastered the light saber bested Luke FRIGGIN Skywalker\\, all with NO TRAINING! By Empire Luke had been trained by two Jedi masters\\, had to be saved several times by Obi and Han\\, was nearly killed on Hoth and realized that Yoda was right\\, he wasn't ready. This point was demonstrated when he tried to face Vader and lost his hand after getting his ass whipped. Rey hasn't struggled or overcome anything. She is the definition of Mary Sue. If that offends you then you are likely a man-hating sjw snowflake\\, an idealogue like Johnson and Kennedy that just ruined this franchise.","true":true}
