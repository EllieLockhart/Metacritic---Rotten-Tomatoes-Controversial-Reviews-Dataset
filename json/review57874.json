Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well where do I start . This film is nowhere near as good as the first one . This film wasted characters left lots of plot holes and left a lot of questions that need answering like where did snoke come from what was the point of phazma the film just didn't make sense at times by far not the best one I've seen at all. And for mariry popins making an apernce trust me you will know when you see it .it's just to overstuffed with joke's when the film would have worked much better if it was as dark as the empire strikes back. All in all not a bad film but some promising characters just wasted with no explanation of who they were where they came from and what they were about full of stunning visuals but as with the prequels you.just can't rely on.that . Rouge one is in a different League compared to this film even though rouge one was a stand alone film . After watching return of the Jedi I was left with only questions .which won't be answered on the last one .so good film to watch I would put this one in with the prequals far the weekst of the two made you think did this director even see the first one . Just so many plot holes and things that just would have been better left on.the cutting room floor and.left.room for character development as with Snok and phasma as I've got no idea what they where about ..","true":true}
