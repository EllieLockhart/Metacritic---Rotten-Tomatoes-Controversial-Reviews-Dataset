Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I cannot believe that this movie was made. They have basically reset the entire Star Wars Universe. Everything prior is now not valid. Who is Snoke? Just supreme leader. No other explanation. Who is Rey? daughter of druggie junkers. What training does she need other than to JUST FEEL THE FORCE!?!?!?! All the sudden these ships have fuel reserves that can be depleted yet can't be caught by ships that have full to jump ahead of them? I mean it was just so bad on so many levels. I am a Star Wars fan. Grew up with it. It was one story that has helped so many through difficult times. When I was bullied relentlessly in school\\, Star Wars was there! And this movie just destroyed it all. Star Wars is dead.","true":true}
