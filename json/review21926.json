{"101487":148551,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-06","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just saw Last Jedi\\, wow...what a way to screw up an unbelievable franchise. Luke said something in his script in regards to his secret island\\, \\\" the most unfindable place in the universe.\\\" Hokey wording??? Also\\, 10 episodes in and now all of the sudden we're talking about low fuel the shields....the beauty of Star Wars is you never had to think about these technical aspects. No offense\\, but rose didn't fit into the movie and neither does Finn\\, the jar jar binks of the new franchise! The imperial commander scenes are out of sink with previous movies\\, too much I felt. Overall\\, thought Disney's sequels sucked\\, read the sequel books as a kid\\, \\\"Jedi Search\\\" series Kevin J. Anderson...fictional characters like Admiral Daala and Kyp Durron. What happened to these plots???? These books kicked a$$.","true":true}
