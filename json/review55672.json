Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Okay so here it is\\, I have loved Star Wars my entire life\\, I grew up watching the prequels and the original series\\, I loved episode 7 it made me feel like a kid again\\, it got me back into Star Wars... this one is Disney\u2019s Star Wars it\u2019s not George Lucas or even JJ\u2019s Star Wars\\, they took something serious and something that had story and they Thor Ragnaroked it... made it funny and crapped all over lifelong fans\\, a lot of people will like it and a lot won\u2019t like it... it has me feeling mixed\\, it\u2019s not bad and it\u2019s not good\\, but it is a must see since we\u2019re getting 6 more movies!","true":true}
