Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I think it's obvious by now that this game is not for everyone. For me\\, I think Naughty Dog knocked it out of the park yet again.First of all the graphics\\, the big set pieces and acting in the game are phenomenal\\, no one can deny it. I really enjoy the gameplay too (some people get burned out by it but that's what happens when you play like 17 hours at a time) the visceral combat is fantastic. But what I am really impressed by is the bold direction they took with the story and the way they structured it. By the end of the game I really grew fond of Abby even though she killed Joel\\, one of the most beloved video game characters. And even though Ellie's story breaks my heart because I care about her so much that's what I signed up for when I play a game like this. This is a bleak world and no other games leave me devastated by the end like The Last of Us does to the point I don't feel like playing anything else for a while.I don't know how people were expecting for ND to just make an exact copy to the first game\\, that was neved going to happen. Also Ellie is not that innocent girl anymore\\, deal with it\\, this is a perfect evolution of her story.Thank you Sony for continuing to give us these experiences \\, the best in entertainment. And to the people who work for this website\\, please make it a thing to verify the purchase when giving a score for a game because we get thousands of people who've never played the game\u2026 Expand","true":true}
