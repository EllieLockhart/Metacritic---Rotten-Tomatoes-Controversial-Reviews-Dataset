Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely terrible. Bad writing. Makes no sense whatsoever. Consistency and character development are abandoned in order to be \\\"subversive.\\\" This movie has made it difficult to imagine giving more money to Lucas Film.","true":true}
