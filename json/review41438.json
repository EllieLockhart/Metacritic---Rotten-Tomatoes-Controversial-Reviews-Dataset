Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a reflection of the current trend of Disney movies. As a Star Wars film though\\, it takes many turns and different takes on the established lore of the universe. In particular many of the items and logic of the Original Trilogy (characters and how The Force works) are looked at from a Nihilst \/ Post-Modern perspective. There is alot of action and kineticsm in it\\, however when you look beyond that there are many plot holes and scifi holes in what happens. It is a movie with modern sensibilities that while taking place in the universe is really something else.","true":true}
