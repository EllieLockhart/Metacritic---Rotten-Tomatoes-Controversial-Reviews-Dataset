Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Man the crazy off the rails hate this got from regular fans and PSYCHOS with a political agenda was just weird. I really really liked what Rian did with The Last Jedi aside from a few jokes that fell flat for me\\, Hux phone call for example\\, this Star Wars chase film mixed with Jedi melodrama  kept me at the edge of my seat\\, also a great score and great looking film that challenges what being a hero is and puts that into the forefront\\, a very welcoming theme\\, along with a hopeful note\\, that fits a modern era Star Wars film. I really REALLY will never agree nor understand The Las Jedi detractors\\, I've been a fan since my mom took me to see Empire Strikes Back 7 times summer of 1980\\, and this is the most excited I've been for Star Wars in a long time post the Clone Wars series. I hope that JJ Abrams doesn't try to appease to the whiny SW fanbase and retcon all the good bits from TLJ\\, it would be a shame to get another lame beat for beat rehash of Return Of The Jedi like Abrams did with The Force Awakens. 4 stars\\, only the bloated running time\\, could have been edited a bit more\\, and some of the jokes kept me from giving The Last Jedi 5 stars.","true":true}
