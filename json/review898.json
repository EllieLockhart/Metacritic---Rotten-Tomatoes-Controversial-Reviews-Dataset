Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An innovative\\, thoughtful\\, original take on Star Wars.  Took the setup from Episode 7 and took it is a new\\, unexpected direction. Bravo to Rian Johnson for taking some risks. In my opinion\\, the 2nd best of all the Star Wars movies\\, only behind Empire.","true":true}
