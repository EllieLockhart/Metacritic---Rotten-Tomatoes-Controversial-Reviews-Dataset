Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It Was Good \\, But Not Great a 92% Is B.S. a 70% is more like it ... to much of the same stuff from previous films =a bar scene\\,a battle scene\\,A bunch of cute puppets & into many places with a weakness of focusing on one central theme.. 7.0 at best not the greatest star wars .. just good","true":true}
