Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In my opinion\\, the second best Star Wars movie to date\\, though still behind Empire by a considerable margin. Honestly\\, the bad reviews (those that aren't made by alts) are the result of tantrums about their fan theories being wrong\\, rather than a reflection of the films quality.","true":true}
