Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not gonna spoil anything\\, but what a disapointment of a movie. Definitely my least favorite of all the movies. So many stupid moments\\, & fake outs. Hated what they did with Luke's character & how they handled the rest of the characters to be honest. It almost felt like they read what every the general fanbase has been saying what they want to see & then made sure that doesn't happen. With all the bad character development aside\\, the action felt really lackluster too. No lightsaber duel?! Those are what I've lived for since I was 3 years old! There's some really bad CGI & other effects too that I couldn't help but laugh at. A few really great moments happen that got me really excited but I could count those on one hand. In the end the bad unfortunately outweighed the good & I am not eager to go see this one again.","true":true}
