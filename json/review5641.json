Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Didn't lead up to anything and just shit. There was no real lightsaber fight which sucked because they are always my favourite parts. The jokes in the movie were childish and they shouldn't have been put in the movie. If I could rate a 0 I would!! I hope for the directors sake the third one is better then the second.","true":true}
