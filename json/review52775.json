Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Almost the perfect movie experience. Twists and difficult decisions by the characters are complemented by the state of the art special effects. Originality is the name of the game. You will be amazed by the storyline this saga is giving us. Do not come to watch this movie centered in nostalgia and be prepared to be open to the new reality... and you will find it exquisite. Why would you want your story to be told? Let us revel in this visionary tale of dark and light\\, of power\\, greed\\, hate\\, and acceptance. The acting is great and the music score is memorable. A must see for fans and non-fans. Can't wait to see the culmination of this trilogy and be thrilled by the dark side once again.","true":true}
