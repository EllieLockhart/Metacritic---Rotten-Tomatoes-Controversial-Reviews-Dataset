Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi transcends.  It sends the message we all need to know\\, feel\\, understand.  You don't have to have noble bloodlines or be special to have that deep connection to the universe.  The Force is not found in a book\\, tome\\, temple or person.  It is there\\, underlying everything\\, binding the universe together and even the smartest\\, most savvy and wise can be completely wrong.  I absolutely loved this movie because it took the hard\\, unbroken and nontraditional path - and it crushed expectations - it transcended them.  Fan boys quit your whining.  Star Wars is not yours\\, The Force is not yours\\, it belongs to the universe and any of us may find our way to that deeper meaning\\, purpose and life.","true":true}
