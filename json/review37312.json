Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The plot is simple and riddled with plot holes\\, acting subpar and the script relies a lot on corny\/overused lines that you\u2019d see in a Saturday morning cartoon. If you are new to Star Wars you\u2019d watch this movie and go \u201chmm that was ok\u201d and quickly forget about it; if you were a longtime fan of the originals however this movie is another nail in the coffin of the creativity and imagination that made the originals the timeless classics they are (well minus the special effects of the old movies obviously). JJ Abrams and his crew do not care about the magic of Star Wars\\, they are putting minimum effort in these movies and using the Star Wars name to generate easy earnings. :-(","true":true}
