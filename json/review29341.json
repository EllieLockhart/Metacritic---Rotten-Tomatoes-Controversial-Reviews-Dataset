Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson brings a new and enjoyable take on Star Wars\\, it takes our expectations and fan theories and turns it on its head. For once in a very long time\\, we now have a Star Wars story that is not predictable and we have no clue where the story in the sequel is going and just like A New Hope it brings back that \\\"a nobody like Luke or even me can be a Hero\\\" feeling which a lof of people seem to forget about.","true":true}
