Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm just gonna say it: This is the best Star Wars movie in my opinion. Yes\\, better than A New Hope and better than Empire\\, fight me bit**es. This is the Star Wars for a new generation and truly \\\"a new hope\\\" for the series.","true":true}
