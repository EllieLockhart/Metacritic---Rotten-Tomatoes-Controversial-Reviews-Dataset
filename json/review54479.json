Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved the story and it was a good story and did have to do with the story. If you don't like it and think it's not supposed to be in the saga then your wrong if you watched every movie and every episode for every show (except for the holiday special) and if you have read every book (including comics) than you would like the movie and you would understand how it can go with the story. If you think you can do better have at it write your own script and tell them to make the movie for you that way we can prove that they did a good job. So don't say something bad about something and than try to do better\\, because what you do is worse than what they already did. And one last thing Th name the last jedi means that look was the last jedi rey never believed in the religion and all of his students were killed by kylo ren and that doesn't make kylo ren a jedi cause he doesn't believe in the religion anymore after luke tried to kill him\\, and don't try to make any excuse to say that the movie didn't go with the story because of what ever cause I'll come right back and tell you how that goes with the story.","true":true}
