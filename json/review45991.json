Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually it is a pretty picture\\, though its horrible writing\\, plot that is missing in action\\, and its overall dismissal of all things Star Wars legendary\\, made this the first Star Wars movie I have only seen once\\, and it was hard to suffer through that opening night viewing. Clearly\\, Disney wants to take Star Wars in a different direction ... if you didn't watch or care for Star Wars before\\, you might like this film as it is completely different from the Star Wars of past. Though if you enjoyed and respected Star Wars of the past\\, this is a terrible experience and painful waste of time.","true":true}
