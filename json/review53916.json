Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How do you decide to two star a movie that is actually great? Because i give it two stars for a Star Wars movie. If this wasn't a Star Wars movie this would definitely be a 4 or 5 star movie with the way its beautifully filmed and crafted.\\n\\nBut as a Star War's movie i'm giving it two stars for this main point:\\n\\nIt shits on the mythos we've been building up for 34 years since Return Of The Jedi.\\n\\nIts almost as if Disney wants you to \\\"kill the past\\\" as Kylo Ren says and realize they are NOT going in the direction of the originator of this Universe George Lucas.\\n\\nIt's always been about Jedi and the Skywalker family yet we've lost Luke the main character that even the last movie made the entire point of finding.\\n\\nIt's not very Star Wars when you have Chewbacca afraid to eat chicken\\, Luke the most powerful Jedi ever apparently blowing his load and DYING after making a hologram and BRAND NEW Jedi Master Rey Fuckaskywalker lifting a mountain after just 3 days of training.\\n\\nso if you can get past all that the movie is excellent and well done\\, its just not a \\\"Star Wars\\\" movie for me personally.","true":true}
