Every single one\\, even with their faults has a special place in my heart. The Last of Us though\\, was something different. It was something that I felt so connected with\\, something that hit me so deep I can\u2019t every truly describe how much it meant. Ofcourse I was looking forward to the Last of Us 2. My most hyped game by far. What I got was something that broke my heart like the first\\, but in the worst way. A game can be dark\\, a game can be depressing. It can mimic the real world and still make something great. The Last of Us 2 took a great foundation\\, a game that helped in a time where I was so consumed by my own grief\\, and spat in my face. It spat in the face of so many others who held the solid story of the first so near and dear. TLOU2 is a graphically beautiful game that holds some of the ugliest storytelling I\u2019ve ever seen. I\u2019m not an angry fanboy. I\u2019m a broken girl who was dealing with the grief of losing my father and found solace in the relationship between two other broken people. TLOU2 throws away all that development which is the very thing the first had going for it.f\\, and spat in my face. game that\u2026 Expand","true":true}
