Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know what all the bitching is about. I wasn't a fan of The Force Awakens because of it too closely following the formula set up by A New Hope\\, but fans seem to be upset that The Last Jedi didn't copy The Empire Strikes Back verbatim\\, which is why I enjoyed it so much. I wanted these new SW films to be different (like Rogue One) and branch out into new territory\\, and that's exactly what The Last Jedi did. It took risks with it's characters\\, went into unpredictable territory and gave us some great action and blockbuster moments to fill out the film. It was flawed\\, yet fantastic. I absolutely loved it.","true":true}
