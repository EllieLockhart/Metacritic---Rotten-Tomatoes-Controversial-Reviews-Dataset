Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They ruined the franchise.  Nothing makes sense.  It\u00b4s basically extreme feminist social justice propaganda.  Luke Skywalker is like the opposite of himself and is completely ridiculous like Hamil argued himself.  The plot is stupid and character arc is not thought out at all. And why the hell are they trying to be funny like it\u00b4s a Marvel superhero movie.  I\u00b4m never seeing a Disney Starwars Movie ever again. Horrible in every way...","true":true}
