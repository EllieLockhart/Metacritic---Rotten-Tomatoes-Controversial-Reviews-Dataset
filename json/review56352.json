Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible\\, just terrible. Worse than the prequels. All of the prequels had moments that make them watchable and even re-watchable to some extent. I have no interest in seeing the movie again. It was horribly silly at times\\, the film was too long and disjointed.  I understand the desire to make an original film and to move away from the same formula as the prior films. You can do that and still make a Star Wars movie. This was not a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
