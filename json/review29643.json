Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"rian johnson singlehandedly ruined starwars. all the interesting characters are dead snoke\\, luke \\, leia. i am no longer interested in seeing ep.9 for what the same old kylo ren vs rey again. which rey is no longer an interesting character. shes not even a skywalker just a plain girl from jakku. TERRIBLE writing \\, all was set after T.F.A just took a turn for the worst. So much potential \\, very dissapointed","true":true}
