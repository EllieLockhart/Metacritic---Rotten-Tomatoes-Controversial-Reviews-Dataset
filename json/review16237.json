Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not a die hard fangirl but I like the originals movies and Force Awakens still holds on strong for me. However\\, this film just felt off. I'm still baffled as to why. It took everything which worked in Force Awakens and either dropped it or turned it too much into parody of itself. \\n\\n-Plot lines they built up were either forgotten or dropped. \\n\\n-Too many comedic relief scenes or characters. What felt funny and natural in Force Awakens felt cheap and cheesy. Maybe it was the editing I don't know.  \\n\\n-Everyone from their granny to a kid understands these movies\\, but it really felt like this film was patronizing. Over-explaining every plot point and emotion. Even using the force to have more people sitting around explaining plot points than just doing something clever with it. \\n\\n-Characters felt like dumbed down versions of themselves. Poe turned into a psychopath a little bit with the kill count he caused. His story arc is better placed in Rogue one than a film with this many one liner gags. Lot of it felt like seriousness Rogue One mixed with the humour of a muppets movie. \\n\\n-Some of the dubbing and green screen work looked off or was too obvious to pick out. \\n\\nI was hyped but I'm left feeling unattached to this film and disappointed in what was meant to be a follow up to the excellent Force Awakens.","true":true}
