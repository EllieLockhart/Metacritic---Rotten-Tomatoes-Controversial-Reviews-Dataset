Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Ok boys i want to tell you the true\\, when i finished my first run on tlou2 i was really confused and the end disappointed me.But after 2 day i finally understand!This is a story about humans!!! I know this is an weird thing to hear but think i little. In the whole story of videogames we can finally see all the story of the good (Ellie) and the bad guy(abby) with all their feelings.Tlou's world is horrible and violent but there is also love. If you steal the the thing that a human loves most (like joel and abby's father) he\/she want take his\/her revenge\\, its obviously\u00a0 because we are monkeys!\\,we follow our instinct and feelings first.but if you know why your enemy have done this you star to ask your self if the real villain is you.Now guys i want to talk about the ending.If you are a kid and you want a good ending you can find it on comics and cartoons\\, because tlou 2 ending it was the most realistic one!The ending is realistic because the protagonist's chooses have consequences and the Ellie's chooses was the most egotistical ones but their was the most human.Im sorry if i have made some grammar mistakes but English is no my first language.Thanks for reading--------------------------------------------------SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILERBTW i felt like an **** when i killed the dogs and in the final battle i dropped down the controller and i started to cry because i didn't want to kill abby.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
