Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All the answers you were waiting for from Force Awakens are left unanswered or totally disregarded. Plot holes galore... a complete disaster that may be impossible to recover from.
