Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is hot garbage which has been overinflated by the egos of Hollywood icons in the pocket of Disney. It would have been a good film if it wasn't for the terrible writing and direction which occurs at the very start of the film where it thematically does a 180 degree turn not once\\, not twice but four times in a row within the first 15 minutes... If you don't think that might be jarring the character development arks aren't much better e.g. my twin sister died sacrificing herself for the values we both believe in but hey\\, since your a guy I've known for what collectively only accounts for a day or two I'm going to throw that all out the window so I can get laid. If your looking for a good Sci-Fi film with lots of action and a good narrative it definitely isn't here... and the special effects whilst pretty\\, don't save this one.","true":true}
