Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have not hated anything so much. \\n\\nI never review movies\\, my bar for a good movie is so low it's actually hard to disappoint me. If I could go back in time and not watch this movie\\, I would. It was not only a bad movie\\, it literally ruined the trilogy for me. I have 0 interest in seeing 9. The disdain this movie has for the rest of the lore is mind blowing. I've never seen a movie take a literal shit on things I love about a series.\\n\\nI left in utter disgust and disbelief.... and I liked the prequels.","true":true}
