Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How did Star Wars get so retarded. Female generals that act like control happy idiots. Meaningless storylines. Bombs that drop in 0 gravity space. They managed to make Luke pathetic. Nice job Rain J","true":true}
