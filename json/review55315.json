Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like many\\, I have created an account just to review this and honestly this is more of a protest than a review. This movie is a tarnish on a legacy that has already endured the awful prequel trilogy. Star Wars is just a movie to some but to many of us\\, it represents much more. It is a world of imagination we were introduced to and fell in love with as children and learned to appreciate and cherish as adults. There are many glaring flaws with this movie\\, as there were in the prequels but what sets this apart is the treatment of the legendary hero Luke Skywalker. Luke deserved a much better ending than this and honestly I will never forgive Disney for this. The opportunity to give a beloved character and actor an epic send-off was squandered here for an edgy dark twist that was not interesting or in line with the Luke we know and love. Mark Hamill did his very best. I wish I could boycott Disney entirely but sadly they are the gatekeepers of much of mainstream creativity and these properties we've grown to love. I wish I could say I will boycott future Star Wars films too and I genuinely would encourage it\\, but I love this universe so much that I think other directors and writers deserve a chance to give it another go\\, but I can never support Rian Johnson again.","true":true}
