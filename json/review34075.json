Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terribly disappointing.  There's just so much wrong with it.  They literally torched Jedi lore.  I honestly don't know where they go next with this weak storyline.  Leia should've perished\\, Luke should've continued on...etc\\, etc.  Arrrggghhh\\, just plain sad that I'd rather watch a prequel.  JJ has an even bigger task ahead of him now than he did reviving the franchise with TFA.","true":true}
