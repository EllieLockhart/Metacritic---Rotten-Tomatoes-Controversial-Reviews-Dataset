Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As I left the cinema\\, I was already dreading talking about the film. I could see many people around me buzzing having enjoyed it. Then I was asked \\\"what did you think...that was great wasn't it ?\\\" I had to think....I felt sadly disappointed....\\\"erm it was alright yeah !\\\" I found myself saying. But it was not alright\\, far from it and in the days since I've seen so many media justifications of the movie\\, I can only assume to save face because the critics may have loved it but many others like me didn't. I'm glad people did enjoy it\\, it keeps star wars going\\, however it's not any closer to being a true star wars movie than the prequels. \\n\\nThe good:\\nThe new characters are great. The visuals are also great. This is a very well shot and produced film and yes I liked the porgs. I had given this one star but porgs and Finn's rebel scum line I think elevate this to a 2. Should it be more ? maybe yeah if the plot\\, characterisation and script backed it up. \\n\\nThe bad:\\nThere are giant leaps of faith required to reconcile all the plot holes in this and TFA or just a 'don't care it looks cool' attitude. Fair enough\\, it's not like the originals didn't make us scratch our heads a few times. \\nMore worrying are the massive character issues in particular with Luke and a kind of illogical disregard for the characters from the original trilogy\\, who don't really need to be in this trilogy at all as main protagonists and seem to be involved just so they can kill them off\\, but this ends up just being predictable and irritating.\\nThe moral dilemma's. Let's just remind ourselves there are forces at work in this story that are intent on the destruction of planets\\, genocide and imposing totalitarian rule on an entire galaxy. The stakes are high\\, thats what the rebels are fighting against\\, yet somehow through a mix of naval-gazing and inappropriate humour the baddies seem laughable and nearly every scene where there should be genuine tension is derailed.\\nThe bad cgi middle. A pointless side-quest intended to sell cgi dog merchandise.\\nThe plot is centred on a drawn out slow chase\\, so anyone who thinks this is cool\\, watch ROTJ and the mayhem that space battles are in the established Star Wars Universe\\, why do the First order ships seem unable to out-pace a few rebel ships this time ?\\n\\nThere is a lack of a cohesive vision for this new trilogy. I don't really feel like they know where to take it from film to film\\, it feels messy and disjointed and without a real feeling of purpose. The focus on the new characters and their personal development along different  paths has become the centre of the story\\, but it's never really clear why Rey hates the first order or Kylo-ben loves it. For all these reason's I don't think this will age like Empire\\, which left us on a cliff-hanger just the same\\, but the feeling I was left with was more 'what happens next?' than 'wtf?'. In general I'd advise any star wars fan or sci-fi fan to watch it\\, it's an entertaining ride but it's a marmite movie....I don't like the marmite\\, I'm not sure I'll be back for another slice.","true":true}
