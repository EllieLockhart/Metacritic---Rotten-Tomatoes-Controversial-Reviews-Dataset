Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lightsaber fight was cool\\, but needed more of it.  Leia flying in space way stupid.  Rey parents reveal\\, way stupid.  Snoke's lack of background information\\, way stupid.  Everything with the casino\\, way stupid.  Luke's arc and astral projection\\, way stupid.  Only one light saber fight\\, with no name bad guys was bad.  It needed more light saber fighting.  Laura Dern smashing the transport into Snoke's ship\\, pretty stupid.  Why had that tactic never been used before?  Once again Rey can do everything with scant training.  And ghost Yoda interacting with the physical world is just the worst.","true":true}
