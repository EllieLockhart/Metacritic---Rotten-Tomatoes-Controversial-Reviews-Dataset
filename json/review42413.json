Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a  complete joke. 20 Minutes in and I was ready to walk out.  Complete train wreck with plot holes\\, pointless subplots and crappy acting. Its obvious that the \\\"top critics\\\" are nothing but spineless weasels who wouldn't dare say anything bad about Disney. I call BS on the 91% approval rating\\, ask yourself this question when was the last time 91% of people agreed on anything? That's what I thought. \\nFor the people who liked this movie what did it for you? Was it the corny jokes at the beginning? Was it Finn walking around in a water bed? Was it Snoke probably the most powerful dude in the galaxy getting killed by Emo Kylo? Or maybe it was Leia pulling a space Jesus after being blowin up? Maybe it was Rose the completely pointless plot filler? Did you like how they made Luke a coward? Or perhaps it was Mary Sue's performance? \\nI completely understand why Mark Hamil said\\, \\\" I fundamentally disagree with everything you decided about my character.\\\" It makes perfect sense\\, he knew this movie was a mess. GOOD JOB DISNEY!!!! YOU WANTED TO KILL STAR WARS AND YOU DID IT! A++++","true":true}
