{"101487":155584,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-22","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My SPOILER-filled review of Star Wars 8 - The Last Jedi (SW8-TLJ)\\n* 2.5 of 5 stars \\n* ranking of Star Wars movies (great to worse) Ep5 Empire Strikes Back Ep4 A New Hope > Ep7 The Force Awakens & Rogue One (like both equally) > Ep3 Revenge of the Sith > Ep6 Return of the Jedi > Ep8 The Last Jedi > Ep2 Attack of the Clones > Ep1 Phantom Menace\\n\\nIn summary\\, this movie is made for casual movie goers and not the Star Wars aficionado\\, nor one who values great story telling. Of all the live action Star Wars movies\\, only Episode 5 and 4 are great movies. The rest are popcorn flicks and home-theater reference scenes. But IMO SW8-TLJ even lacks great reference sound scenes. Ep2 AOTC was overall weak film but had unique sounds like audio black hole of Slave 1's depth charges.\\n\\nIf you enjoyed this movie then really I am happy for you. Star Wars is billed as event movie. This movie was a disappointment. My adult son holds Lord of the Rings in the highest regard. He was disappointed in the Hobbit trilogy. IMO\\, SW8-TLJ is like the Hobbit trilogy.\\n\\nComplexity and shocks do not equate to great story. I feel the people who value the shocks in this movie do not fully contemplate this in the SW story arc. Many on Rotten Tomtatoes and IMDB members are movie lovers and for an event movie like SW8 TLJ to disappoint is why we are seeing negative reviews and the Rotten Tomatoes audience score over 35% difference from professional critics score.\\n\\nSome of my major criticisms of the film: \\n(1) Please don't imply it a new trilogy if what happened in Episode 7 and the Original Trilogy (Ep 4\\,5\\,6) can be completely disregarded.\u00a0\\n\\nExample#1. Leia-Poppins (or Leia Superman) scene. In no other SW movie has Leia used the Force in physical way. Here she can survive the airless of outer space and Force her way back to the Raddus ship bridge. Here she can do the Superman-like flying because the script calls for it. Disregard all prior precedent. In part this is also lazy story device\\, IMO.\\n\\nExample#2 Luke acts way out of character. Please see the web link at end of this post for Mark Hamill's own opinions posted on Huffington Post. First scene with Luke is he receives Anakin's lightsabre from Rey and he chucks it over his shoulder. This was clearly done in part for big laugh and shock. The mood at time did not call for any humor. Already by then forced humor of Poe prank-calling Hux and FN=2187 leaking bacta fluid suit. A better more realistic action and in keeping with \\\"hermit Luke\\\" as written would have been: he looks at Anakin's lightsabre and hands it back to Rey with facial expression I do not want it and leave me alone. Rejection of the Force as Luke has done in SW8 TLJ does not equate into action of disrespecting his father who he fought at risk of his life to redeem in Ep6 ROTJ. Audiences also saw huge importance of Anakin's lightsabre in Ep4.\u00a0\\n\\nAnother example of Luke acting out of character in SW8 TLJ : his fleeting thought of murdering Ben Solo while Ben slept. This is from same Luke who redeemed his father in Ep6 ROTJ?!\u00a0\\n\\nExample#3 Snoke is built up in Episode 7 to be one the most powerful (if not the most powerful ) Force user. In SW EP8 TLJ they continue this idea and theme (e.g. he wields Force lightening on Kylo Ren in their first scene). He toys with Rey literally like she is a puppet. Then Kylo kills him and no backstory and no more Snoke; just another disposable character. I am first to call this movie to be made \\\"Snoke and the First Order - A Star Wars Story.\\\"\\n\\nExample#4 Rey is the ultimate Force wielder. We saw her defeat a multi-years trained Force user (Kylo Ren) in Episode 7 though it was 2nd time she ever touched lightsabre. Excuse in that movie was Kylo was injured from Chewbacca's laser shot to his flank. Well Kylo is healed up in this SW8 TLJ and again Rey is the ultimate lightsabre user as she defeats her portion of Snoke's Elite Praethorian guards and assists Kylo as he could not. All this from self training on Temple Island on Ahch-To?!\u00a0\\n\\nIMO lazy story telling in having Rey advance to master Jedi lightsabre skill with effectively no training. Why did we even bother showing experience needed in Episodes 1\\,2\\,3 and 4\\,5\\,6? Rey is just born with it and has video game like \\\"God mode.\\\"\\n\\nAlso Rey can force sense the good in Kylo and instructs Luke that Kylo can be turned to the Light side of the Force. She is the now the Master and not Luke because hey that is what the story calls for. Yoda in SW8 TLJ even mentions she has mastery of the Force. So what with Yoda's >800 years experience. Again video game like \\\"God mode\\\" for Rey.\\n\\n\\n(2) SW8 TLJ breaks the rules it establishes. Raddus bridge blown out by Tie Fighter and all on bridge including Leia sucked out to space. Leia then wakes up from frozen state and Superman\/Mary Poppins flies back to Raddus bridge (where again clearly shown there is no gravity and vacuum of space). She is seen by Poe and Connix (played by her real life daughter Billie Lourd) and they do not later ask her about this power. When Leia is back from Superman\/Poppins flight on Raddus bridge\\, Poe and Connix open bridge door to let Leia back in. Uhhh....shouldn't Poe and Connix be sucked out into space? Of course they were not.\\n\\nRose Tico states she is pipe cleaner and Finn (FN2187 ) states he was floor moper for First Order in SW8-TLJ. And FN-2187 can't fly ship in episode 7. However both can pilot relic Crait fighters with ease and very well in SW EP8 TLJ.\\n\\n(3) Way too many bad jokes\/inappropriate. For example Luke drinking green milk from nipple of Thala sirens\\, and way too long Poe prank calling Hux.\u00a0\\n\\n(4) For all the changes that Rian Johnson mentions\\, very unoriginal callbacks to prior SW movies.\\n\\nExample#1 Dialogue of Snoke to Rey in his throne room on Supremacy is very similar to SW 6 ROTJ Emperor to Luke. . Example #2 Crait battle is like Hoth (even had new AT-M6 and some original AT-ATs).\\n\\nExample #3 Millenium Falcon (MF) flying inside Crait cavern like MF flying inside Death Star 2 in SW6 ROTJ.\\n\\nExample #4 Rey quits training (if can even call it training) with Luke and goes to confront Kylo and fails. In EP5 Luke quits training with Yoda and goes to confront Vader and fails.\\n\\n(5) Canto Bight story could have been trimmed down 95%. It appears the only reason for it was for FN-2187 and Rose to get ship past Supremacy's shields and establish Broom boy (Timiri Blagg) and make statement that rich people & military industrial complex are bad.\u00a0\\n\\n(6) Useless Poe mutiny story and stupid of Vice Admiral Holdo to withhold plan from Poe.\u00a0\\n\\nThis is only 1\/4 of the problems I have with SW8 TLJ. But the above are the major ones. I have seen in twice (2nd time with my two kids). They both rate it 2 out of 4 stars.\u00a0\\n\\nI skipped the Dolby Cinema screening as picture rated not excellent by AVSforum.com and it would have been $20\/ticket and closest Dolby Cinema is over 30 miles from my home. This movie is not worth that time and expense..\\n\\nhttps:\/\/www.msn.com\/en-us\/movies\/news\/mark-hamill-rips-his-role-in-last-jedi-hes-not-my-luke-skywalker\/ar-BBH9JU6?li=BBnb7Kz&ocid=mailsignout\\n\\nSadly for me\\, I likely will have to move on from Star Wars. Let's hope JJ Abrams and the script writers can correct the SW story for Episode IX. FYI I do enjoy new science fiction since 1990 like (in no particular order): \\\"Children of Men\\\" \\\"Arrival\\\" (Amy Adams) \\\"Dark City\\\" Matrix (only first one) \\\"Minority Report: \\\"Moon\\\" (Sam Rockwell) \\\"Gravity\\\" (Sandra Bullock) \\\"Mad Max Fury Road\\\" \\\"Edge of Tomorrow\\\" \\\"Wall-E\\\" \\\"Blade Runner 2049\\\"","true":true}
