Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars movie so far (Yes\\, including the prequels and Rogue One).\\nBasically nothing happens the whole movie that moves the plot forward\\, except for the two obvious death. The humour feels like it's from a bad sitcom. All of the scenes including Finn or Poe are useless. Phasma came back from the trash compactor just so she can fall in a pit of fire. It is still a mystery to me why Rose's character is in this movie. There is way to much Fan-service : Here comes Yoda's ghost controlling lightning\\, Leia can fly in space\\, Rey and Ben can have FaceTime Force conversations.\\nThe actors are still terrible\\, the twists are obvious\\, there are plot holes everywhere.\\nAnd the list does not stop there.\\nHowever\\, there are a two good scenes :\\n-\tRey and Ben's fight against the praetorian guards\\n-\tThe \u00ab light speed kamikaze attack \u00bb\\nFor thoses two reasons\\, I won't give TLJ the worst grade possible.","true":true}
