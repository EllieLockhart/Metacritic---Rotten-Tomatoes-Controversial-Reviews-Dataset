Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good movie IF IT WASN'T A STAR WARS MOVIE.  The opening sequence is VISUALLY FANTASTIC BUT RIAN JOHNSON CRAPS ON THE LEGACY OF STAR WARS JUST FOR THE SAKE OF DOING IT FROM THE SECOND LUKE SKYWALKER APPEARS ON SCREEN.","true":true}
