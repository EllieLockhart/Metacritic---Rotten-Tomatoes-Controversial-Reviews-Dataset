Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie managed in a few scenes to accomplish what Phantom Menace\\, Attack of the Clones\\, and Revenge 9f the Sith could not: give the antagonist a plausible motivation for turning to the Dark Side. I was iffy about Adam Driver after Force Awakens\\, but now I'm all in. My only complaint was a bit too much comic relief.","true":true}
