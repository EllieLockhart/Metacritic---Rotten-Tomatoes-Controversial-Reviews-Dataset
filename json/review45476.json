Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointed\\, I thought that they would fix a lot of the mistakes from the Force Awakens\\, and they did not. Throughout the movie it was very hard to feel connected with anyone\\, and the acting is pretty bad.","true":true}
