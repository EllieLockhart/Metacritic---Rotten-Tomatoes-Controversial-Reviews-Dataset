Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars yet - incoherent narrative\\, zero character development\\, pointless side-plot\\, and to top it off it totally shuts down everything set up in The Force Awakens. I was especially disappointed that Luke was written as a bitter and lazy curmudgeon who can't even leave the planet.  What was the point? Disney needs an inclusive business model that considers all fans.","true":true}
