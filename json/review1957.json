Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As much as I wanted to enjoy the film\\, there were too many plot points that were purposely made to be the opposite of everything that should have happened for the sake of doing the unexpected that the movie didn't make sense.","true":true}
