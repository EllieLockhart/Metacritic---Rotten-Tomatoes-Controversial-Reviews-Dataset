{"101487":129508,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am no crazy huge Star Wars fan\\, but after seeing Last Jedi\\, I have a lot of sympathy with them and I am myself extremely disappointed by this movie. \\n\\nBesides the action battle scenes and the twist with \\\"Supreme leader is dead\\, long live the supreme leader\\\"\\, Disney and Rian Johnson screwed up  what they could: \\n-SWJ  education through out the movie (selling guns bad\\, torturing animals bad\\, eating meat bad\\, women in leadership etc etc.)\\n-physics - gravity-bombing in space\\, no sucking out to space after opening door\\, loud explosions in space and more...\\n-jokes everywhere - call prank to general Hux\\, first Jedi lesson and more...all cinema laughed\\, but I was at the same time asking - WHY? This is Star Wars\\, not a comedy\\n-characters playing last man standing - movie direction wasting one great character after another\\, some new ones before they could even make any impact in the story line\\, some old ones we are just casually informed about their death\\, not being even captured on screen...In case the director's point is to restart Star Wars anew without all the old classic characters\\, why to go through this excruciating way of killing them one by one\\, youngsters taking their place\\, instead of writing a script from Start Wars world say 300 years after?\\n-plot development - was there any besides shrinking Rebel forces to a size of Millenium Falcon crew and Kylo Ren becoming boss of First Order?\\n-stupid things with no meaning - vice admiral Holdo's character (btw in a dress\\, not a uniform)\\, Luke Skywalker milking Lochness-sea-cow and extreme spear-fishing\\, casino side-quest...\\n-character development - screwing Luke completely\\, no progress of no-need-to-be-trained hyper-tallented Rey-Jedi\\, Kylo Ren still just immature angry boy (this time without helmet) and a leader\\, nothing\\, nothing...\\n-film-making - tension-building does not work when there are constant unexpected switches\\, jokes or comedial situations. I never for a moment was worried about Rey's\\, Finn's\\, Poe's character characters. Ending of the movie with all nearly all rebels masacred by saying \\\"We have all we need\\\"...ugggh.\\n-cheap lines like \\\"Let the past die\\\"and \\\"books are boring\\\" ...\\\"That was a cheap move.\\\"\\n\\nI was sitting there for the most of the movie not believing my own eyes that this is supposed to be Star Wars moview and that someone rated this 90+%. I want a Disney movie critic job ever since. \\n\\nHuge disappointment.\\n\\nOh and no I am not a robot and yes\\, I have registered to Rotten Tomatoes for the first time as the pro critics saying this movie deserves 90+ % motivated me to publicly say what I think about the movie. I have seen movies that deserves this rating and this was nowhere close to them.","true":true}
