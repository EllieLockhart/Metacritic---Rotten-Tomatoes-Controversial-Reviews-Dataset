Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This isn't the Star Wars you saw as a child. It's a Star Wars that has been through the school of hard knocks and seen its heroes grow old\\, die\\, or become painfully disillusioned while the next generation tries to find their way in the universe.\\n\\nIf you go in expecting to see the cycle of the original trilogy continue - go home and watch Empire Strikes Back instead. It's a great movie. As the by-line of the trailer says: \\\"This will not go the way you think it will!\\\"\\n\\nMany things seem familiar\\, until they are not. Its great fun\\, but don't go in expecting your favorite fan theories to hold water. They will all be dashed.","true":true}
