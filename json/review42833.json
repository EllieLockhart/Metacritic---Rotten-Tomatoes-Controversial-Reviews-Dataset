Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie wasn't ok. Last third had no star wars feeling at all. The terrible jokes made it even worse. And Leia\\, Snoke\\, Luke scenes were garbage. I hope Disney breaks down and there wont be IX episode from them.","true":true}
