Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this movie was awesome.  Great drama\\, fantastic suspense\\, and most of all\\, it put all of those fan theories cooked up from watching .25 seconds of a trailer on their asses.  It also solidifies Luke Skywalker as the baddest Jedi that ever lived.  People are flawed and this movie certainly explores that from Poe's inability to see the bigger picture to Luke having a moment of weakness that undoes all of his efforts in the original trilogy.  I mean\\, who WOULDN'T that break as a human being?  Great show!  Don't believe the haters\\, just go see it for yourself.","true":true}
