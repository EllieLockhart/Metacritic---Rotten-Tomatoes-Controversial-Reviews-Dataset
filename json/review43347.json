Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a horrible movie\\, with a handful of visually pleasing scenes. As an adult male\\, the best part about this movie were the cute little penguin things and the disgruntled caretakers. That's it. I expected more from Luke coming back\\, but it was just a disappointment. Perhaps the best part of TFA was the teasing the return of Luke at the end. For so many men of my age\\, it would be like bringing back a part of their childhood. I'm sad to say\\, they never should have brought the character back. He\\, and Mark Hamill\\, deserve better than that. \\n\\nAlso\\, while trying to be \\\"diverse\\\" in casting\/role development\\, Hollywood still remains mysteriously racist towards Asian males and keeps driving the whole agenda that Asian females are to be incorporated into their world in stereotypical roles. You can tell they purposely cast a throwaway Asian on the First Order ship just to cut between him and the first Asian sister who sacrificed herself to set off the bombs. I am sure not many noticed it because they aren't Asian\\, but on a rewatch\\, they had a very specific cut between their two faces\\, back to back. Horrible First Order Asian male; heroic Asian female rebel killed by male's actions. You don't really see any other Asian males until the Casino subplot\\, where another Asian male pops up as one of those \\\"bad people\\\" profiting off of selling weapons so they can gamble decadently. To be fair\\, there was one older Asian male in the background of a rebel meeting\\, and I do believe the other new SW movies did try to add some in the background. I did praise Rogue One's treatment of Asian males until I read that they were supposed to be homosexual\\, which is a another common treatment Hollywood has for them (see Captain Sulu). Also\\, Rose ended up the Julie to Ross (Finn) and Rachel (Rey)\\, in what was a completely superfluous plot development. This was just an awful love triangle\\, and completely unnecessary. \\n\\nJust like the \\\"Diversity Oscars\\\" a year or two ago\\, Hollywood doesn't care about being truly diverse or fair when it comes to race. They just care about what is popular at the time. So if Race X or Gender Y is popular now\\, and they fall into the trap of bombarding us with those casting choices\\, how is that different when the White Male was the most popular choice? It isn't. It's just a different decade\\, and a different trend.","true":true}
