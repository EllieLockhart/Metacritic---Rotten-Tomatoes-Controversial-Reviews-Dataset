Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Without analyzing the individual details the glaring problem representative of the movie as a whole for me are the contradiction between the movie's theme and plot\\, and that of the recurring characters with their previous iterations.\\n\\nThe film's narrative professes to be about letting go of the past and building something new\\, (several characters\\, quite on-the-nose\\, verbally extol this very theme) while all that 'happens' in the film is a repeat of The Empire Strikes Backs's plot with the addition of resetting the Star Wars universe back to exactly where A New Hope began. \\nThis isn't moving on from the past\\, this is literally repeating and (an attempt at) recreating it\\, from the ground up. Unfortunately it doesn't have the heart nor soul to pull that off.\\n\\nWhen the core theme of the film and the outcome of its plot are at complete odds you get a bizarre cognitive dissonance where the film comes across to the viewers who pick up on such as being about nothing\\, except to undo or destroy everything that has come before it. \\nThe Last Jedi is seemingly being given a pass only by those unfamiliar with the Saga that comes before it and thus unaware of inherent contradiction it creates\\, or are willing to switch their brains off and treat it as its own thing\\, but pick and choose for it all of the setup they like from the previous entries.\\n\\nThis movie would actually work at a conceptual level if it wasn't a continuation of the previous saga or was\\, akin to Spaceballs\\, a separate work of satire; but then it would have to stand up to its structural\\, pacing and execution issues instead of all the goodwill audiences have brought in with them for the franchise.?\\nA disappointing entry which seems to have actually been aiming to disappoint the Saga - and it's only bold decision is to claim that move is a virtue.","true":true}
