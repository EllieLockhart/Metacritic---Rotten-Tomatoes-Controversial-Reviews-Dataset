Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie kind of goes in its own creative direction\\, kind of spitting in the face of the 40 years of canon created\\, all the novels\\, all the rich history.  The movie itself was pretty entertaining if it didn't bear the Star Wars logo.  If this was just a generic space movie I would have found it pretty good\\, but because they took all the rich history of the Star Wars universe and basically \\\"burnt it\\\" I came out more disappointed than satisfied.","true":true}
