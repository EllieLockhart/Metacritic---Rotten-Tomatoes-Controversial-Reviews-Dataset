Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*CONTAIN'S SPOILERS*\\nStar Wars: The Last Jedi\\, directed by Rian Johnson\\, will\\, as Luke tells Rey\\, \\\"not go the way you think\\\". The Last Jedi begins straight after the end of the Force Awakens and it is immediately apparent that Rian's vision for the new Star Wars is being put on the big screen. This is the most ambitious film in the franchise to date\\, as it settles all the fan-theories that have strangled every Star Wars fan for the past two years\\, by simply scrapping them\\, and I seriously liked it. First and foremost\\, all the characters\\, bar Han Solo\\, return in this epic\\, action-packed and emotional film\\, including Rey\\, Finn\\, Poe\\, General Leia\\, and Kylo Ren. After appearing briefly at the end of the Force Awakens\\, we finally see Luke as the old\\, rugged and isolated Jedi\\, who simply does not want to go back to what it used to be\\, saying that \\\"it is time for the Jedi to end\\\". We are also introduced to a trio of new characters: Rose\\, a maintenance worker in the resistance; Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo\\, a leading officer in the resistance; and DJ\\, a codebreaker and a thief. Each character\\, both old and new\\, have a shining moment\\, few\\, in particular\\, were visually stunning to watch\\, such as Kylo Ren slicing Snoke in half with Luke's lightsaber and Holdo sacrificing her own life for the escaping resistance ships by flying the command ship straight at the First Order fleet at lightspeed\\, silencing the film so the audience could stare in awe. The acting was the best that's ever been in a Star Wars movie\\, with Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker and the late Carrie Fisher as Leia Organa the highlights in that department. The action was spectacular\\, particularly as the Rey and Kylo team-up against Snoke and the rebels escaping the First Order fleet was panning out at the same time. The story arc of Rey\\, Kylo\\, and Luke was incredibly well done\\, with Rey planting herself as a powerful force user and Kylo apprehensive on his allegiance to the light and dark sides. The reveal of Rey's parentage I believe was very well done and came as no surprise to myself\\, but I'm am certain that many who were expecting something more grandiose will be dissatisfied. Admittedly\\, however\\, many Star Wars fans will find these revelations and events irritating and conflicting. One such being of Supreme Leader Snoke\\, who was simply a red-herring this whole time\\, and though his death was shocking\\, it was somewhat unwarranted that the Force Awakens painted him as the ultimate villain\\, similar to Emperor Palpatine\\, for then to be killed off. Despite this\\, the whole sequence of events spanning a short period time that led up to this moment was suspenseful and thrilling to watch\\, and the immediate team-up of Rey and Kylo\\, as well as the kamikaze of Holdo into the fleet\\, culminated in without a doubt\\, one of the greatest Star Wars moments. My other issues\\, some are nitpicky\\, include Captain Phasma\\, who was a wasted opportunity again\\, and will be known as the Boba Fett of the current trilogy; the Finn\\, Rose story arc was weak and the ensuing romance felt forced; how did Finn\\, Rose and Poe know to call Maz Kanata to find the codebreaker when only Finn had met her for barely a brief moment in the Force Awakens; and how did DJ know about the escaping rebel ships when they were captured. I know many found Leia's using the force to fly in space far-fetched (I initially found it weird)\\, but knowing this was Carrie Fisher's last movie as Leia\\, it was a nice to see her using her force sensitive powers numerous times. My lowest point of the Last Jedi was Canto Bight. What was the point really? The entire plot to find the code-breaker was utterly pointless and eventuated in a total failure. It introduced nothing that was relevant to the rest of the main plot and in the end\\, they found a less qualified thief in Benicio del Toro's DJ. Overall\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\, despite its weaknesses in some aspects\\, is one of the best in the franchise\\, equal second with a New Hope behind Empire Strikes Back\\, and where many of the negativity comes from maybe because it is the least like any Star Wars movie previously. Many of the complaints are fair\\, but the surprises that we were least expecting made this a far more thoughtful film and its ambitious take on the universe of Star Wars is a refreshing new step.","true":true}
