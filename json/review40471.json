Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the first time I've left a public review of a film.  Simply put\\, I found the movie awful and beyond its obvious slapstick attempt to not take itself too seriously and bring a \\\"modern\\\" edge to the series\\, it was simply unentertaining.\\n\\nFirst\\, the plot makes no sense both in terms of purpose and pacing.  Second\\, there's no real drama as one feel as if the fight between the resistance and the first order is a plot device rather than a struggle of substance and meaning.  Third\\, characters are at best\\, skimpy (excluding Ren)\\, at worst\\, appear to be written with more than subliminal nods to subverting stereotypes\\, which unfortunately plays into tropes\\, like Vice Admiral whoever.  Fourth\\, the entire casino planet was an absurdist and reductionist critique against capitalism and wealth\\, particularly the line about \\\"it feeling good to make the town hurt.\\\"  What?\\nWhatever this film was\\, it had precious little of the mix which has made Star Wars what it is.  I've found films in the franchise disappointing before\\, but never so terrible.","true":true}
