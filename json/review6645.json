Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't believe the anti-hype.  This is a tremendous film that leaves me extremely excited to see where Episode IX goes.  Btw\\, the second viewing was even better since I knew where the story was going and I could get the feels\\, and it was all waterfalls.  Just beautiful.  And I say this as someone who grew up on the original trilogy\\, a fan of forty years: this was exactly the movie I wanted.","true":true}
