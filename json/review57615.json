Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To me The Last Jedi was an awesome addition to the Star Wars episodic narrative. I have seen it twice in theaters now and both times I was enthralled the entirety of the movie. Rian Johnson did a wonderful job! He brought something new to Star Wars and I am very happy for it. The movie has great storytelling and character development and I felt invested in certain characters even though I had just met them this in this episode. There were some things that I didn't care for as is the case with any movie\\, but they did not detract from the movie. I will say that I am not a fan of pop-culture humor and I did find some of that in the movie; sometimes it tried to hard to be humorous\\, but most of the time I felt like the humor was fun and worked well with the story. Overall I put this in my top three favorite Star Wars movies. My only gripe is that I have to wait two years to see Episode IX.","true":true}
