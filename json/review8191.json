Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":". Fantastic movie that feels like the second act of the story. It borrows from ESB but throws in many surprises and isn't afraid to take risks. Not sure why so many early fan reviews were so mixed. My guess is that 45 year old fanboys are crying out\\\" Not my Star Wars!\\\" Go\\, watch and enjoy.. From a 48 year old fanboy.","true":true}
