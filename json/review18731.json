Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a film the trilogy needs to recover from\\, and with one film left that's just not possible.\\nThe Force Awakens did a good job of setting the trilogy up\\, the characters worked\\, the direction of travel was pitched but not set \\, and most importantly the framework of a story was established.\\nTLJ destroyed all of that\\, knocking down all of the hard work done to set it up. Very very disappointing","true":true}
