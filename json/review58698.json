Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"So\\, I've played a fair bit of this game I pretty sure I'm close to the ending. The game play isn't too bad it has the odd issue with a few bugs. Though it was only released a few days ago. So\\, they may patch a few who knows at this point.  As for the story it isn't that bad at all it makes sense some disbanded fireflies wanted Joel dead. For killing the only person who could make a vaccine and one of their fathers. It's a revenge mirror storyline in a way. If you look at the protagonist's team and antagonist's team. They\\, are very similar both driven by the same force. Cold hard revenge at any cost.Which in a way messes Ellie up a bit mentally after she kills the one woman at the aquarium place It really does mess her up.(she literally vomits on the floor). I would say it a very harsh story it makes you hate the antagonists then\\, almost understand them. It makes you see how revenge can be all consuming. If you were wondering about Abby she is a muscular\\, straight female character.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
