Also non-lethal weapons are not existent (This is a problem for me since i like to not kill people in games if i have the opportunity)\r\r- Also in some levels even though you got pass all the enemies around they will get alerted because the only exit is blocked by a QTE.\r\r- The story structure; While at the climax of Ellie's story\\, there is an abrupt rewind where you play as the secondary protagonist to see her side of the story.\r\r- No skins \/ funny unlock-ables: Previous game gave you a few skins to have fun while replaying the campaign\\, almost all games that came from this company (Naughty Dog) have this feature (Eg: Uncharted 2\\, Uncharted 3\\, Uncharted 4\\, The last of us)\\, you could unlock in-game stuff like Models\\, concept art but nothing you can use in the campaign.\r\rAt least you have new game+ with all your upgrades and weapons.\r\rNo chemistry: Previous game had you sympathize with all its cast (Bill\\, Tess\\, Ellie\\, Marlene)\\, while this game introduces many more characters to the cast you don't feel the same level of attention put into them\\, at least on the first half of the story\\, second half introduces a character from a faction known as \\\"Scars\\\" and i liked their part of the overall narrative.\r\rDefinitely a game you should try at least once\\, but overall i did not like a few design choices\\, mostly stealth levels and sometimes i felt like the game dragged for too long\\, the story was interesting but overall it didnt captivated me as much as the previous entry.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
