Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've given myself a week to post a level-headed review. Here it is.\\n\\nIf you're a casual Star Wars fan or someone who hasn't followed the movies\\, you might like parts of this movie. Sure\\, one of the three plot lines goes absolutely nowhere. But the movie looks nice and the acting is mostly good\\, even if the dialog is awkward.\\n\\nHowever\\, if you are a Star Wars fan\\, this movie is an insult. I don't care that it defied expectations\\, that isn't the point. Rian Johnson shows a fundamental lack of understanding of what makes Star Wars 'Star Wars.' With one script\\, he completely negated Luke Skywalker's entire arc in the series. The only person in the galaxy who saw good in Darth Vader contemplates murder and gives up on everything and everyone.\\n\\nI understand the new movies are meant to focus on the next generation of characters. That's fine. But if you cannot lift them up without destroying the previous generation\\, you are unfit for the job. Anyone can destroy\\, it takes talent and skill to create.\\n\\nRian Johnson was more concerned with defying expectations than actually telling a story. The problem with only setting up expectations to upend them is that\\, by the end\\, the story has not progressed anywhere.\\n\\nThis movie was an insult. I cannot recommend it to anyone.","true":true}
