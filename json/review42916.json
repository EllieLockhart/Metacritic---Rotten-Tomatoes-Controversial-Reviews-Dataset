Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was so good. While the pacing felt off throughout\\, all of the actors were pitch perfect. Johnson took risks (something I was beginning to think Hollywood as a collective whole were immune to) and most of them paid off. The sets were beautiful\\, Rey and Kylo's story is far more interesting than anything that has come before it. Someone finally realized that Mark Hamill can do so much more than he's been allowed to as Luke. It is a lot to take in and that's what a middle sequel should be I think.","true":true}
