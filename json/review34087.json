Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TFA and TLJ use almost all SJW tropes to make its plot - Finn is the ONLY (maybe there's one more black character in both TFA and TLJ) black character\\, specifically a token black character\\, there is a strong\\, independent woman who don't need no man\\, stupid and cocky men\\, masculinity shown as the ultimate evil while femininity is the ultimate good.\\n\\nSequels may not be entirely politically correct\\, but it's very near that. For example: Trump is politically incorrect because he demonizes illegal immigrants and wants to ostracized them from the country.\\n\\nBy this standard\\, TLJ is not politically correct because it belittles men compared with women. To a lesser extent\\, it specifically belittles white guys.\\n\\nMen and women: Each of the 3 arcs consists of a good woman admonishing a flawed man. Holdo admonishes Poe for being a hothead (even though destroying the Dreadnaught was the right move). Rose admonishes Finn for desertion. And Rey admonishes Luke for retreating from the Galaxy. The pattern is the same. Women are righteous and wise\\, men are weak fools. \\n\\nAnd these are just the tip of the iceberg. \\n\\nNow about Di$ney: When they acquired everything that Lucas sold them\\, one of the very first things they promised was a \\\"new & original\\\" SEQUEL trilogy. That is what got people excited for this new trilogy - the fact that finally\\, they were going to get a sequel\\, a continuation to the events seen at the end of 'ROTJ' and what did they give instead? A re-hashed\\, re-mashed remake that NO ONE asked or was waiting for. THAT'S what most people wanted\\, they didn't want a \\\"homage\\\" or a \\\"tribute\\\" to 'ANH'\\, they wanted a true sequel (and I'm not even going to go into Di$ney\/KF's lies to the fans behind the making of TFA). \\n\\nMany think TLJ is the film that \\\"ruined\\\" SW but the truth is\\, TFA did that 2 years before. The only reason it didn't get the backlash that TLJ got was due to the fact that\\, even though it was not what most fans were waiting for\\, it brought back Ford\\, Fisher and Hamill. That was the main reason that people didn't tear it to shreds (like they should've). If you remove those 3 characters\\, the entire film would've flopped on it's head. I think most people know and would agree that there's no way in hell that TFA could've survived with just flaccid\\, boring\\, mediocre acting and characters like Rey\\, Finn\\, Poe\\, Ren and Snoke. \\n\\nPeople give it a \\\"free pass\\\" simply for the \\\"nostalgia factor\\\" but\\, was that what Di$ney and Kennedyfilm promised everyone back in 2012? No way\\, not by a longshot. If Lucas hadn't sold anything to Di$ney\\, announced he was making Ep. 7 while making all the \\\"promises\\\" that Di$ney made to fans and in the end\\, delivered the exact same film that is TFA\\, do you think all the Prequel haters (who oddly enough\\, are now the majority of Pro-Di$ney drones who defend TLJ in a futile attempt to keep people believing that Di$ney would make SW \\\"better\\\") would've praised this film like they're doing now that it's made by Di$ney? Hell no. They would've crucified Lucas saying he was a hack that promised everyone a new and original sequel trilogy but\\, who was now cannibalizing his old films and the EU\\, just to squeeze even more money from SW fans. GUARANTEED. \\n\\nAnd even all of this is STILL THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG! Yes\\, it is that bad\\, and worse.?","true":true}
