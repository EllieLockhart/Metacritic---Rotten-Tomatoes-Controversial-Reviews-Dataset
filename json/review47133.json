Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a let down! What has happened to a once great franchise that had depth and now only seems shallow Disney crap. Bring back some raw feeling to the Star Wars movies\\, not just bloated social justice warrior nonsense.","true":true}
