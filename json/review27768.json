Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"People who know little about Star Wars will find this movie good. Fans of Star Wars will find this movie horrendous because it has little continuity with the previous episode. \\nThe acting and visuals were great\\, but the story was terrible. I'm fine with Rey being super powerful in the force and with a light saber\\, but not if she has little to no training. She already destroyed Kylo Ren in the Force Awakens without any training\\, so where's the threat?","true":true}
