Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A VERY DISAPPOINTED DIEHARD FAN. I haven't been able to get rid of this knot in my stomach of disappointment and feeling upset since watching Star Wars: The Last Jedi. I don't blame Disney because they got it right with The Force Awakens and Rogue One\\, but I do most certainly blame Rian Johnson. He has single handedly ruined\\, if nothing else\\, the story of Luke Skywalker. Remember\\, the very last time that we saw Luke was as a wise\\, strong\\, teachable\\, and good natured young man that had just faced his Father and the Emperor. He had very humbly burned the suit of Darth Vader after having a heart wrenching first and last conversation with his real Father.\\n\\nJump to now\\, The Last Jedi\\, we meet a resentful\\, selfish\\, and angry Luke who is only worried about himself as he says \\\"I came here to die\\\". And why? Because Kylo Ren turned on you to the darkside? So that's how this once wise\\, strong\\, teachable\\, and good natured Luke deals with challenges\\, to isolate and think only of his failure? Not to mention the fact that he has 'lost his faith' in the Jedi and his once perfect understanding and humble use of the force? Just because it would appear Mark Hamill is a little resentful and overly sarcastic at times doesn't mean that's who we knew Luke Skywalker to be. How can anyone really watch the original trilogy now with the same feelings towards Luke knowing what a loser he ends up becoming? Why care about Luke at all anymore? He doesn't even care for Yoda it would appear. How contrasting was that compared to the last time we saw them together? \\n\\nThe movie felt like constant projection of Rian Johnson\\, projecting his own person opinions and resentments and humor (that he personally finds funny) in nearly every single scene. There were times I felt like I was watching The Hunger Games and no longer Star Wars. Purple hair\\, come on. Why do we have to modernize\\, and in turn ruin the greatest movie series ever made? The planet of gamblers and casinos also felt like Hunger Games and the police looked like they belonged on The Incredibles. My son adores Star Wars at age 6. But he won't be able to watch this film for years to come with all the overly intense and dark nature with Snoke\\, far too much compared to what we're used to which is saying something. And when did Star Wars decide to swear constantly? Talk about trying to 'get with the times' in a world where swearing isn't nearly as offensive or uncommon as it now is. \\n\\nI could go on and on about flying Princess Leia's and how pathetic those AT-AT's now look compared to those pointless other machines next to them that are far larger and apparently supposed to be cooler. I want Episode 8 back with a clean slate and pray that someday\\, someone will remake it and retain the sanctity of what it once was. But how? Mark Hamill will be gone soon and we'll be left with the memory of how we once viewed him in his role of Luke Skywalker before Rian Johnson destroyed it all with his own projection and agenda.\\n\\nAny movie can entertain you\\, but Star Wars has always been about more than that.","true":true}
