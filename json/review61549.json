The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Look\\,  The plot\\, is just bad. Gameplay\\, Repetitive. Only Pros I'd give this game is the graphics. Graphics are amazing. But the plot is absolute Bull crap. Ellie's whole revenge story makes no sense and the way they killed joel off within 2 hours of the game is just stupid\\, wrong and horrible writting. First\\, The characters. Ellie acts like the freaking female version of sasuke uchiha throughout the whole game and it doesnt make anyone want to play as her. Dina doesnt even need to be in the story its just cringey teen love. Jesse was a decent character just to get freaking shot in the head 2 seconds within walking through a door. Tommy is Just.. ugh.. Joel doesnt even act like joel. After years of experience\\, you'd expect him to be smart enough to not trust strangers\\, especially in this apocalyptic world. Speaking of apocalyptic world\\, The whole god damn story is all about Ellie getting revenge on the people that killed joel\\, Massacring All Wlf\\, And Scars that stand in her way. So the infected play no god damn role in this game. The fights are useless and not fun at all. Okay back to the characters. Abby\\, The she hulk herself. They have the audacity to make us play as one of the people that killed our most beloved character\\, thinking that we'd sympathize for her. No\\, We wont.\rAll the other people are just nobodies that we dont care about. Okay now lets get into depth here.\rYes\\, i get what they tried to do\\, A person we do not know kills one of our beloved characters because of what he did in the past and she wanted revenge. That was a semi good idea. But the WAY they did it was absolute Dog doodoo. The pacing is horrible\\, the characters are not likeable\\, the gameplay is repetitive\\, And its just downright BAD. We lived for 7 years knowing that ellie and joel has always been the good ones (Not good people\\, but the people that we know and love) But in this game they try to FORCE you to hate them\\, and sympathize for Abby cause of what joel did. That just isnt smart at all.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
