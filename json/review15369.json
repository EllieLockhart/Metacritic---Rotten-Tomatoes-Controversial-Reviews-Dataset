{"101487":135099,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I logged in specifically here to comment on this movie even though I am risking now to get my email and Facebook wall filled with lots of Rotten Tomatoes. \\n\\nI do this because it has come to my attention that there is a campaign underfoot to discredit the people who dislike this atrocity of a movie by claiming they are bots or fake Facebook profiles.\\n\\nThis movie failed me in pretty much all my expectations. \\n\\nThere are 3 types of expectations. The first type is character-specific expectations like \\\"Snoke is Darth Plagueis\\\" and \\\"Ray is a clone of Palpatine\\\". Indeed\\, the movie is not obliged to satisfy these\\, and honestly I don't give a damn about all of them. However\\, I do feel a sense of disappointment that the potential of all characters (and not just these two) was sacrificed in the process of \\\"killing the Star Wars past\\\" that comes next.\\n\\nThe second expectation is \\\"be consistent with the rest of the lore\\\". If you are going to market this as \\\"Episode 8\\\" of a saga\\, don't crap on the first 7 (and all of the associated content) just so that you can say to the fans \\\"Gotcha!\\\". This is compounded by failure to come up with anything compelling after the past had been so brutally dispatched. I do not want to see the past killed\\, I want to see it either built upon or replaced by something equal or even better. This part is where  \\\"Rogue One\\\" brilliantly succeeded and this movie utterly failed - failed me as Star Wars fan who enjoys not only the \\\"episodes\\\" but also associated content like the animated TV series and the books. Thinly veiled political propaganda of the sort we got is definitely not going to cut it - especially when it comes from a big corporation like Disney to boot. So I shall respond accordingly\\, which is ignore  \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" from now on. No second viewing in theater or DVD or in-flight entertainment\\, etc. Actually I wish I could get my ticket money back\\, but I don't think Disney intends to cough back any of their fabled \\\"second highest opening weekend gross of all time\\\"\\, to which I also contributed\\, much to my disappointment.\\n\\nAnd finally there is the generic expectation of good story telling\\, compelling characters\\, believable plot\\, etc.. This part is connected with the one above. These are the actual devices that whoever was responsible for the concept and creative choices made - you now who you are - used to destroy the legacy of Star Wars. That is why even though I could have been able to tolerate them in other movie\\,  I find them so utterly disappointing in this movie . The humor - well done on its own - utterly destroys the mood of the movie. Who is going to take The First Order seriously after that \\\"Skype\\\" between Poe and Hux? If I want to see a good humor superhero movie\\, I will go see \\\"Despicable me\\\". And then the flying SuperLeia? When I saw that I cringed. Force ghost Yoda suddenly becoming like Zeus conjuring a mighty thunder? Imagine all of the other things he could have done to ward off evil\\, but he somehow didn't.  Cringed again. I can go on and on for every specific cinematographic choice they made\\, but you get the drift. The Last Jedi would have been a good but generic action hero movie\\, but as a part of the  \\\"Star Wars\\\" saga fails miserably. Regrettably\\, no amount of flashy action sequences and brilliant special effects - very well done\\, I admit - can save it. These are the only thing this movie got right - but so did Rogue One.","true":true}
