Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It does take a while to get used to this movie. What I mean is\\, it's not the Star Wars I grew up with. Sure there are lighthearted moments but this movie is all action and takes a turn that that most fans hate. We know what happens to Leah and Luke was a surprise but this is the pass to torch to the new comers and there is no limit where this might go. ","true":true}
