Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Quite simply\\, no story\\, or at least none that you would care about. The space opera of my youth has been put aside for a blastfest with each scene feeling like it was being made up as it went along. Hailed as being new\\, it felt like scenes from ESB and some of ROTJ played out of sequence.\\nA waste of Luke (why was his lightsaber blue)\\nA waste of the build up of Reys backstory \\nNo explanation of Snoke\\nNo knights of Ren\\nAn anti-hero message that any attempt at heroic ingenuity is reckless and to be discouraged. Perhaps true in the real world but this should be swashbuckling fantasy escapism. \\nJokes inserted as if to pre-empt the eventual Family Guy parody.\\nNo good reason to make episode IX. \\nFinally\\, i am frustrated reading 5 star reviews which simply say 'well i liked it'. \\nIgnoring my detailed complaints above\\, you liked what exactly?. There was simply no story to this movie.","true":true}
