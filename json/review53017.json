Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a movie\\, the Last Jedi was entertaining to watch. As a Star Wars movie\\, it was terrible.With seemingly no creative direction and lore breaking concepts\\, I'm not sure how the franchise continues as an epic space opera with no solid structure to work from. If a new director can just come in and change the core aspects of the franchise that have been carried from film to film. What is the point of tying any of the films together? Something needs to be done in the third installment to turn this ship around\\, because it's on a collision course with irrelevance.","true":true}
