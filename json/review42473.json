Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a huge letdown and a smack in the face to all the fans who have enjoyed these movies for the past 40+ years. Luke was made into a horrible character and the hero that many children grew up with and looked up to was made out to be a coward. There were many political opinions that were forcefully put into the movie\\, many of which actually conflicted with core themes and ideas of the good guys\\, especially the weapons trading with the X-wings vs Tie fighters! \\nI just hope that JJ Abrams can redeem the next movie\\, I'd even be willing to have George Lucas come back and direct the next movie\\, this one was so bad!","true":true}
