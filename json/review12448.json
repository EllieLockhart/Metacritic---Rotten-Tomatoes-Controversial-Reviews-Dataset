Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I cannot believe people cried at this movie; because they were so disappointed?!?\\nI was not impressed and I had such high hopes. It seemed disjointed when compared to the meticulous care reflected in so many which came before. I hope this did not ruin future films for me.","true":true}
