Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best thing about The Last Jedi is that it surprised me. While early on\\, it hinted at being a \\\"soft-remake\\\" of Empire (similar to the TFA & New Hope)\\, thankfully TLJ took a very different turn and told some very different stories.  This meant that the audience didn't really know what to expect\\, which characters would turn\\, and who would make it out alive. I was really happy that the took some risks\\, even though they all didn't pay off\\, as it made for a much more thrilling movie.","true":true}
