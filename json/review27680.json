Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pathetic writing\\, bad acting and unoriginal.  This is social justice warrior nonsense.  Disney is destroying the franchise.  I can't believe that I actually missed Jar Jar Binks this movie is this bad.  Star Wars is not quite as wonky towards science\\, but you have to wonder if the writers\\, producers and director understand zero gravity.  Free fall bombs in space\\, space ships that stop when they run out of fuel\\, not to mention Leia's\\, Mary Poppins scene makes this movie cringe worthy and insulting.  It looks like Disney was trying to piss off white males a large segment of this movie's market.","true":true}
