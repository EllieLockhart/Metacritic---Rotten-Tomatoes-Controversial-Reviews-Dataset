{"101487":134785,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked the Last Jedi and yet it is the most frustrating Star wars movie I've ever seen. \\nI liked:\\n1. The risks. The story took everyone by surprise. \\n2. Luke and Kylo Ren perspectives of the night that changed both of their lives. \\n3. The anti star-wars heroism approach\\, showing that the result of heroism is often misery and pain.\\nI didn't like:\\n1. The discontinuity with The force awakens. When you spend an entire movie to open so many doors\\, you need to provide a valid reason when you close them one by one. \\n2. The plot holes. I'm usually very easy with plot hole when they help the story ... but here it's pretty flabbergasting. If you can destroy an entire fleet with 1 cruiser\\, why don't they always do it! If they can turn on and off other Jedi lightsabers why don't they always do it? \\n3. The lack discontinuity in the plot\\, as I said the anti-heroism thing is great\\, but the movie does not even give a damn. Some substantial portion of the movie (with Finn and Rose) would have had a reason to be if there was an effect on the characters but here.... nothing\\, not a word\\, no guilt\\, no change in Finn behavior\\, no WTF talk with Poe about what they did. ok ok in a way\\, it's very human. Yes\\, we are so good at ignoring our mistakes\\, and blaming others\\, but it kind of makes this all part of the movie useless. 4. The character's situation at the end of the movie. [CAUTION SPOILERS]. In the Alliance\\, except for Princess Leia and Rey\\, all the others are either dead or have lost a lot of credibilities\\, as they are responsible for the death of the others. On the new-order side\\, their new leader keeps been beaten by untrained people and inspires sadness more than fear. Their main general has been ridiculed by Snoke himself and keep been beaten by Kylo Ren.  \\n\\nThere is way more to say about this movie. So to enjoy this movie\\, lower your expectations (by a lot) and you should ok.","true":true}
