Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably my least favorite Star Wars of all time and that's saying a lot considering Jar Jar. Felt like Riann was trying to hard to make this his own. Jokes seemed forced\\, acting was rough in the beginning. Some of the cinematography was sub par. The music was gone\\, never had that Force music moment like all before. When you thought it was coming it didn't. I absolutely hated what they did with Luke. With that said the movie does have some highlights it def had its moments in a few cool scenes. For me it just wasn't a Star Wars movie. May as well been guardians of the galaxy. Good action but did not compare to quality of force awakens ??","true":true}
