And then when you disapproved of what they have done\\, they spit on you and slapped your kids and your wife\\, kicked your dog as it tried to defend your home\\, and flipped you off as they drove away to the cemetery where your ancestors are buried\\, to shit and piss on the graves. essentially this is TLJ.","true":true}
