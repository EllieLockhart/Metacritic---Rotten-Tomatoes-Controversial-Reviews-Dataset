Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"first time it seems like a good movie\\, but after watching again i realize how terrible the writing was. just a bad movie all around which is a shame cause the cast is very good.","true":true}
