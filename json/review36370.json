Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The more I think about this movie the more frustrated I get.  I'm tired of writers using Source material with complex mythologies to tell us that not everything needs to be so complex..  Maybe that's what some of us are there for.","true":true}
