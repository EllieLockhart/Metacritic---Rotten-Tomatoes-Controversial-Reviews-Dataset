Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love star wars and I understand that they need to move away from the original characters. This movie was visually stunning but the story was bad. The characters were horrible. The worst\\, they are actively trying to get away from everything that made the original films great. As much as I love the series\\, if this is how it's going to be\\, I predict that the star wars movies only have a couple left before its totally dropped by its fans.","true":true}
