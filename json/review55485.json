Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie was horrendously\\, terribly bad.\\n\\n- extremely wooden\\, lazy dialogue\\n- inability to create an actual mood or atmosphere due to poorly timed jokes. People laughing and smiling and joking right after losing 90% of their fleet? Doesn't make sense.\\n- Repeated deus ex machina. Basically the entire movie is a string of people making stupid\\, illogical decisions and then miraculously being saved.\\n- Pacing was awful. So many times I thought we were finally at some sort of climax \/ resolution\\, only to get plunged into some random issue. It sort of felt like nothing was actually happening. The thing is\\, though\\, things were happening constantly. They just didn't feel like they mattered\\, and they weren't woven together in a continuous way. It felt like I was literally watching a series of storyboards that just go \\\"and then this happened and then this happened and then this happened\\\"\\n- Very little character development. Rey and Luke were more fleshed out\\, but everyone else felt superfluous and I had no reason to care about them.\\n- Action and visuals were okay. Things blow up. Spaceships zoom around. Animals were (perhaps overly\\, beat you over the head) cute. I felt like I was watching Power Rangers when they fought against the imperial guard though.","true":true}
