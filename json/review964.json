Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An obvious attempt to get rid of all iconic characters and fans. Job well done. Time for modern day fans to swallow this type of garbage. Star Wars is now on par with Transformers. So long folks. Enjoy the subpar crappy ride.","true":true}
