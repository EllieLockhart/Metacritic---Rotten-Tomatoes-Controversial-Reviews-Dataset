Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Another classic film franchise lost to so-called progressive sensibilities\\, wielding the PC\/diversity sledgehammer like the dull\\, blunt instrument that it is. Humour is hit-and-miss at best. Would have been better if Lucas had not sold out to Disney\\, and left the series 'unfinished' at six instalments.","true":true}
