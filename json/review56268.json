Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Stunning visual effects and props design and good acting from Luke\\, Rey\\, and Kylo. However\\, many things in the movie didn't make any sense. I believe they could have done a better job with the transition from old charaters to the new ones\\, I mean they could have given both Luke and Rey a larger screen time to flesh-out their characters and grow. I'm not a long-time SW fan (just watched all the movies maybe 4 years ago) but it felt off when they used the hyperdrive as a weapon and how General Lea tricked death with The Force. Maybe everything was rushed. Honestly\\, I don't have much to look forward to in episode IX.","true":true}
