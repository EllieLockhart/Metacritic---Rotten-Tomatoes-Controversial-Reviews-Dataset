Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was good\\, some parts i didn't like (such as the canto bight scene) but besides that it was good. Luke's character was good and the whole story with Kylo and Rey\\, The effects were amazing and the characters were great.","true":true}
