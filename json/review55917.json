Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson deconstructs the Star Wars formula\\, and in doing so\\, gives us a near-perfect Star Wars film. It has characters we care about\\, heart\\, depth\\, and all of the ships and space battles you come to expect. One of the very best films of the franchise! ","true":true}
