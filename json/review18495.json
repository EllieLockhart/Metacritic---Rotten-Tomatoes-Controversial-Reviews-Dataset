Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is obvious that in 2017-2018\\, the movie-going public has lost touch with the true and great films. It is a shame to see that the audience score is so low but when you think about it\\, my voice nor the voice of others in the audience score section really have any credibility too the critics who understand good films.","true":true}
