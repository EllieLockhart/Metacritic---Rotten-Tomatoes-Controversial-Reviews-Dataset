Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Seriously 91%. This movie is a pile of poop and an insult to The star wars franchise. \\n\\nI obviously watched a different film to the one people are rating here. The story is full of holes and BADLY written and I mean BAD - With poor continuity and lack of any story what so ever. A complete hash up of childish attempts to captivate the star wars fan base with constant badly thought out homages to ROTJ and ESB. \\n\\nI feel let down in a big way\\, \\n\\nThe infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type a given text\\, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare or The last Jedi...\\n\\nThe plots and scenes from RTOJ and ESB - Truly shocking and there is NO WAY this film deserves the high score the critics have given it.\\n\\nSHAME ON YOU DISNEY and shame on the positive reviewers.","true":true}
