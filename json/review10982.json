Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Having loved TFA\\, I went into TLJ with high hopes. That was a mistake!\\nWorst SW movie ever made! \\n\\nPhantom Menace is like Empire Strikes Back compared to this trash.\\nAnd Rose is way more annoying than Jar Jar Banks.\\n\\nAnd just think: Disney want to give Rian Johnson his OWN Trilogy of Star Wars movies!!  Was this not bad enough?!\\n\\nOh and the score should be way lower than 49%!","true":true}
