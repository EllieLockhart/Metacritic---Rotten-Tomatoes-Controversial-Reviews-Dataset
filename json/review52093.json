Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing TLJ for the third time\\, I realized that the movie wasn't only amazing in terms of its scenes and dense character development\\, it was also great because it was easy to relate with\\, very political\\, intriguing and emotional. \\n\\nThis is writing like no other. Kudos Rian.","true":true}
