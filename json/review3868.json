Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bloated. I can accept the ditching of what J.J. Abrams set up but this film is too long. Several storylines should have been left on the cutting room floor. This from a serious Star Wars fan.","true":true}
