Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Agenda driven narratives and symbolism unsubtly in place of any potentially decent story-telling. Poorly timed and delivered humour by non-comedic actors and actresses partnered with an obvious dispense of craft leaves the viewer knowing precisely what the producers consider of their intended audience. All of which amounts to the least enjoyable episode of the franchise to date despite any advances made in visual and audible techniques for which this film could be credited for.","true":true}
