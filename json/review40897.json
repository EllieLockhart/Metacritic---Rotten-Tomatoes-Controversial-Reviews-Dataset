Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie destroyed all previous characters and has no plot at all! There are three useless story lines and a plot hole every few minutes.\\nI wasn't expecting too much of this movie\\, but it couldn't deliver a single good moment\\, see what they did with Star Wars is totally depressing.","true":true}
