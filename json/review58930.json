We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"A real disappointment\\, if anything. Graphical fidelity and environments are beautifully crafted\\, although the game switches from an open area style to a more linear style quite early on\\, which I thought was odd\\, because the open environments were some of the best in the game- regardless the graphics and environments are what I would almost call groundbreaking- if death stranding didn't exist. In terms of gameplay\\, it's almost unchanged from TLOU1. Gunplay and fighting all work more-or-less the same\\, crafting stays from the first game and are identical\\, very little innovation in that sector but honestly\\, it holds up fine. The story\\, however\\, is where this game takes a massive nosedive. Most of my points have been noted already\\, but here's what I found absolutely awful about the story. Uno: the way Joel's death was handled. Joel had to die\\, let's be honest. The story wouldn't have been able to take a step forward without his death (although admittedly the story didn't mean to take a step forward- the story was concluded in TLOU1 and should have stayed that way). But the way they handled it was absolutely laughable. If they had structured the game differently and included some of the Abby sections and flashbacks BEFORE Joel's death\\, it might've worked narratively. But this game fails to do that\\, and instead of an emotionally charged scene where we develop hatred towards Abby\\, we get an emotionally charged scene where we develop hatred towards Neil and his **** self-insert. Couple this awfully-done plot point with characters being forgotten about by both the player and the actual in-game characters (i forgot Manny's **** NAME after he was killed\\, and only knew him as \\\"Neil's **** self-insert for the rest of the game\\, and apparently so did Abby because he's never **** mentioned again). Along with the single worst ending in the history of any videogame ever\\, and it all amounts to a story that goes nowhere\\, stands for nothing and utterly ruins everything that was great about the first game. Well done Naughty Dog\\, you done **** up. In the words of Joel: \\\"There was a sequel. Wasn't as good.\\\"\u2026 Expand","true":true}
