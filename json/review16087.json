Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Im a pretty casual fan of Star Wars and dont emidietally decline anything in the franchise but I feel this movie contradicted everything The Force Awakens created. JJ Abrams is gonna have a bad time fixing this mess. Also the Canto Bight seen was too long and was blatenly obvious filler. Id say this could be a really fun movie if your wasted as hell but as a Star Wars movie it does not like up to its potential.","true":true}
