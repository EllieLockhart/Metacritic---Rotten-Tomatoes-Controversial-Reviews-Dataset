Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Quite a step down from the original films. Characters lack chemistry\\, feels like they are plug and play\\, borrowed from the past (especially first) films.\\n\\nThe visuals are nice\\, actions scenes are decent. But several decades of technology don't make up for the fundamentals of what makes a great movie.","true":true}
