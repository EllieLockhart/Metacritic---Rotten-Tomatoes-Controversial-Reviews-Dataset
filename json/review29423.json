Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson drops the ball\\, and basically kills Star Wars in one fell swoop. From the disrespect to characters people have loved for forty years   to the implausable scenes to the snarky progressive\/left leaning undertones\\, TLJ accomplishes an impressive feat....that being that I don't care about Star Wars anymore and that I won't be viewing Episode IX.\\n\\nThank you Rian Johnson for ruining a movie. Hopefully your position for the upcoming trilogy is replaced and reconsidered\\, and that JJ can reboot Star Wars properly. \\n\\nBall dropped\\, and opportunity wasted.","true":true}
