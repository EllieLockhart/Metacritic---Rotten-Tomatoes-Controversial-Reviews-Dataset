Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a fan of the saga my entire life\\, but this movie was by far the WORST. It doesn't hold true to the understanding we have of the Force from Lucas's movies\\, the books\\, and games. The movie COMPLETELY ignored who Snoke was. This was supposed to be a huge reveal. Oh\\, and Rey's parents? Thanks for the colossal letdown\\, Rian. And Luke Skywalker...really? That's how you're going to treat him? Don't get me started on their blatantly stupid treatment of the fate of Leia. Congrats on screwing yourself for Episode IX. \\nThe positive is that this movie was very entertaining. That's about it\\, though. Finn's entire story arc in this movie is a waste of time. Literally. He's a great character and literally everything he did was pointless. \\nI will not be watching the next movie in the theaters. I'm going to wait for the reviews\\, read them\\, and sigh in exasperation just like I did after I walked out of the theaters after this thing ended.","true":true}
