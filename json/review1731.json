Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a stand alone movie\\, it is good. Awesome visual\\, one of the best I have ever seen. But as a Star Wars movie\\, it is a disaster.\\n\\nI am not going to go into all the negative points that other audience has made\\, so my bigger question is....why did Disney do this? Why did Disney try to unwind all the past legacies of Star Wars?.  Even from a business perspective of selling toys and merchandise\\, it still doesn't make sense.\\n\\nLook\\, this film has the theme of \\\"forget the past\\\" all over the place.  Even Kylo has a line on that telling Rey to forget the past. Ok..I get it.....new characters need to be introduced\\, storyline need to evolve.  But a good movie maker should try to make this transition in a subtle manner so that they do not turn away the older fans.  I mean this is a 40 years old franchise\\, not a 4 year old one and million of fans have Star Wars in their blood. To ask these fans to accept the abrupt changes and still liking the movie is clearly an impossible task....\\n\\nWhile moving forward with a movie cast and new storyline is important for the franchise\\, Disney should also remember that it was the past that brought 40 years of successful track record that made Disney bought the franchise. And now Disney wants the fans to forget the past? Does that make any sense from the business point of view?\\n\\nAnd please\\, remove the jokes.....they are not even funny and truly annoying. They remove away the tension that was so much needed in a Star Wars film.  \\n\\nI think after 40 years\\,  I am finally done with this franchise. And thanks to Disney for helping me to make that decision\\, otherwise I wouldn't know when should I stop spending my money on Star Wars stuff.","true":true}
