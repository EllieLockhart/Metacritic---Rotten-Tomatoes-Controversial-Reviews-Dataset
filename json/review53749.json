Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great movie. But a terrible \u201cStar Wars\u201d saga movie. Someone needed to think about the DNA of \u201cStar Wars\u201d first\u2014which has to do with light vs. dark\\, not just good vs. evil\u2014related but distinct concepts. This film has plenty of the latter\\, but little of the former. And Benicio del Toro\u2019s character seemingly exists to drive that point home. A decent movie\\, but a betrayal of the themes that make \u201cStar Wars\u201d \u201cStar Wars.\u201d","true":true}
