Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First time around I really wasn't sure\\, but on a second viewing\\, when I got over the excitement of another Star Wars movie\\, I was really impressed. I think it will stick with me (in a good way) for longer than The Force Awakens. Certainly one of the most emotionally resonant of the saga.\\n\\nWe could definitely do with less star \/ director cameos in future SW movies\\, though.","true":true}
