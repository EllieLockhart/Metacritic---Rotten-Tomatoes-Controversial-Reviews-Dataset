Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the new storyline seems like it could have been good\\, the execution is extremely bad. From editing that is reminiscent of the prequels\\, to feeling slow\\, to the introduction of far to many new characters\\, the movie just isn't good.","true":true}
