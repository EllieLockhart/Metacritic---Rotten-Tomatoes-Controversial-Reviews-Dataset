Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well shot\\, very cinematic\\, lots of action\\, diverse cast and completely unpredictable.\\nThe new director took a lot of chances and gave us an enjoyable albeit less inspiring story. Lots of issues with time and storylines that don't go anywhere\\, it's a mixed bag of good ideas that weren't presented well.\\nUnfortunately some of these choices left me with more questions (in a bad way) than I care to discuss. Most of the new characters have not endeared themselves to myself or others I've talked with about the new trilogy. Just days after viewing the movie\\, my normally scifi excited son couldn't even remember the plot of the movie. He liked it but wasn't awed. \\n\\nI left out of the movie liking what I had saw but not loving what I saw. Being happy for the story but not being fulfilled by it.","true":true}
