{"101487":184482,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a Social Justice Warriors wet dream at the expense of basic storytelling. Every male character is whiny\\, stupid\\, egotistic\\, immature\\, irrational\\, or make the wrong decisions or not to be trusted. And guess what\\, the \\\"new\\\" Luke Skywalker has some of them traits too! \\n\\nThe leaders in this movie are female\\, the protagonist an over-powered female (with little training). The people making sacrifices to save everyone? Overwhelmingly female apart from one character. And most are infallible. The days when men saved women? The roles are well and truly reversed in this movie. Not to mention the diversity\\, interracial relationships just for the sake of it that add nothing and the only joke when it came to racial issues was at the expense of white red headed male character when mentioning his \\\"pasty\\\" skin tone. \\n\\nIt was comical to see Chewbacca becoming conscious of being a meat eater (but not in the way they intended)\\, and Luke Skywalker disgustingly milking a sea cow (there was absolutely no point in this). This is supposed be a galaxy far away\\, and yet you're reminded of the war-profiteering and rich people being evil. \\n\\nHaving animal rights issues thrown in there and a female who looks like she teaches gender studies in the role as an Army General with dyed purple and we're all set. The only thing I wasn't surprised at\\, was that Luke Skywalker didn't come out as transgender or wasn't accused by Kylo Ren as being a \\\"white male\\\" as an insult. Oh! and did I mention that white people are evil? \\n\\nFor what it's worth\\, I enjoyed it. The visuals are well and truly beautiful\\, and the action sequences are great. However\\, without that it offers nothing\\, because the writer is so politically driven with Feminism\\, Diversity\\, and anti-white male bias. The focus is lost.\\n\\nLost that is\\, on telling a remarkable story that makes sense! The last Jedi's plot has more holes than Swiss cheese. The character development is so bad that you simply don't care about any of them. Characters come and go\\, you don't know who they are\\, and even worse you don't care.  \\n\\nDisney tried so hard to wipe the slate clean that even the Characters blatantly tell us to forget the past on BOTH sides of the war. Luckily\\, I'm not a huge Star Wars fan and I found some parts amusing that I shouldn't. Something happens with Princess Leia that made some people including myself in the cinema laugh. Like wtf is going on here moment? otherwise I'd be completely gutted. \\n\\nWhat made Star Wars great\\, like the Jedi\\, the Luke Skywalker of old etc is not in this movie. Whoever wrote this movie surely must get the award of 2017's most successful troll.","true":true}
