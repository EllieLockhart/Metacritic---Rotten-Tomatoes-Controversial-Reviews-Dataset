Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I walked out of the theatre almost in shock. I didn't know what to say...but now with some time to think\\, here is my honest review. There are no spoilers in this text.\\n\\nFirst off the movie looked great\\, the visual effects were mostly on point\\, though bland in some instances. Certain shots looked too perfect though I can forgive that. I thought the actors tried their best with what they were given\\, and I think the new porgs(?) are cute.\\n\\nThe main problem with this next chapter of Star Wars is that it completely dismantles everything the prequels and the original trilogy had going. It is pretty much a slap in the face to long time Star Wars fans. Now I understand they want to clean the slate in order to provide more stories and novels to the wide open future of Star Wars\\, and many questions as to why certain characters turned out the way they did will be covered in upcoming novels detailing the time spent between Episode 6 and 7. However\\, I feel like this is all a cop out move by the writers\\, directors\\, and creative minds in Lucasfilms. In fact\\, this movie betrays The Force Awakens. Some of the archs in the movie are not necessary\\, characters come and go and provide no depth to the movie\\, the audience is left asking questions as to why they should care about certain characters\\, there are too many plot holes that shake both the foundation of Star Wars and the future set ups\\, and I feel like most of the themes surrounding this movie revolves around unnecessary political stances and agendas. This is a science fiction movie that is supposed to take me away from the current political climate. Instead I get more SJW agendas shoved down my throat. I mean\\, I don't really mind anyones political ties\\, but don't shove this down our throats\\, especially in Star Wars...it just feels out of place.\\n\\nThere is no world building of any kind. Nothing new was added to the franchise. There was no imagination brought forth by the directors or the writers. It was pretty much The Empire Strikes Back combined with Return of the Jedi with a HUGE slap across the face of any Star Wars lore fans.The way certain characters bowed out was disrespectful towards the actors\\, and the direction this franchise is taking seems to be forced. There are too many questions to answer. I don't mean from a Star Wars point of view\\, but from a PR and creative direction approach. Did they really need to crap on everything the previous Star Wars set out to create and establish?","true":true}
