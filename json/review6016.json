Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointment! Commercialised for Disney to sell silly 'cute' characters which were unnecessary through the film. The film focused on the wrong areas giving air time to less important bits and in turn only giving a few seconds to the bits we all came for. Too silly\\, borderline slapstick comments \\\"chrome dome?!\\\" What an original Star Wars material.\\n\\nOverall it has been Marvelfied. Far too many super tight camera\\, stupid in house jokes and a little too long.","true":true}
