Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a fast paced action extravaganza from start to finish and a fantastic film made with loving dedication to the Original Trilogy within its own right.  Excellent Story\\, Excellent Battles and Visual Effects\\, Excellent Drama and Character Interaction and a Brilliant Return to form for the Star Wars Universe for fans young & old\\, or indeed new to these Cinematic Universes.","true":true}
