Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dec 15\\, 2017\\nBest movie in the series! No complaints at all! Honestly\\, It gave me answers I wanted and left me wanting more Star Wars! I can't wait til Episode 9! WONDERFUL JOB DISNEY!!!","true":true}
