Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"star wars the last jedi is a really great film most of the characters were developed well and tge film had alot oftwists and expanded ourknowledge about the force and the star wars galaxy. this film had its flaws but overalisthe best star wars movie for me since the empire strikes back. most people did not like this film becuase they said it left the fans with a mess\\, the same comments were told when episode 5 came out saying that the film was left witha mess i personaly think that when episode 9 comes outand they deliver with the moviethe last jedi wouldbe accepted by the fans just like what happened with the empire strikes back","true":true}
