Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A garbled mess\\, it was like being stuck in Kylo Rens head with no point or fist-pumping moments.  Luke's character was misused\\, Leia's character was wholly unnecessary\\, Poe was \\\"poe\\\"larized and Fin was..well Fin.  We don't visit a lot of planets which is typically a mainstay in these trilogies and our expected \\\"cantina scene\\\" was tired at best.  Wait for the DVD or Digital release there is really nothing that can be spoiled here as truly nothing happened.","true":true}
