Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some interesting ideas poorly executed - tone is a mess\\, plot is a mess. Is this supposed to be the same series as rogue one \/ empire? At least we got Bladerunner 2049 this year - think that might be the movie remembered in 30 years time","true":true}
