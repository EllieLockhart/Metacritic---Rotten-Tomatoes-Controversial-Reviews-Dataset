Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"SPOILERS below...\r\rFar\\, far\\, far too long. It's like they included a DLC that you have to play between the end of the game and the epilogue (which should have been on the idyllic farm - Ellie should never have gone to Santa Barbara).\r\rThere was also no good reason for Ellie to go through all 3 days. She barely escaped with her life from a few scenarios and she could have just turned round and gone home at any time\\, especially once she found Jesse & discovered Dina was pregnant. Tommy was fine on his own. The stakes were never high enough (unlike the first game where Ellie was going to be the source of a cure). I just spent most of my time thinking what's the point?\r\rI wouldn't have minded playing as Abby - I think it's a good idea to see both sides of a story - but the whole thing was just dragged out far too much. I was bored of playing as Ellie at the end of day 3 and thought I'd finished the game. Then I had to play as Abby for another 10+ hours (which I also got bored of\\, literally an hour or so into day 1). Some scenes were also very hard when playing on hard.\r\rThere was absolutely no reason for Ellie to leave the farm and go after Abby again. It was just pointless. It also annoyed me again because I thought I'd finally finished the game and Ellie had found happiness\\, only to have her inexplicably throw it all away to go back to hunt for Abby\\, and again\\, why? She and Joel were survivors... I think she'd have been glad to have been in love and with Dina. She wouldn't have gone.\r\rIn this game I also couldn't help wondering how zombies stay alive. I mean\\, Ellie goes into a building that's been deserted for 20 years and there are zombies walking around in there? I did think that in the first game but I let it go. In this game though\\, when she falls through a floor or something and there's a monster waiting for her it was just a farce. But it's a zombie game\\, so I almost let it go\\, but couldn't really this time.\r\rI played the first game a second time. I'll never play this again. It was far too long and just wasn't enjoyable (although it looked great).\u2026 Expand","true":true}
