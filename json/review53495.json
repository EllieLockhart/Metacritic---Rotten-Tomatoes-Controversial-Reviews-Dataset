Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't watch this expensive Disney fanfiction. \\n\\nI grew up with Star Wars\\, and this movie was the ultimate betrayal to me. The complete and utter destruction of the lore was inexcusable. I may be able to forgive the plot holes and bad jokes\\, but what they did with Luke and the lore was unforgivable. If my memory is correct\\, the word \\\"Sith\\\" was not said once in the movie\\, and I am simply left with unanswered questions. You don't even know if Snoke is a Sith or just some force user. Nothing was accomplished in this movie\\, apart from the destruction of a great modern fantasy.\\n\\nNo\\, my childhood is not destroyed. Thank God for EU","true":true}
