Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So I've spent 11 euros for the 'iSense' experience\\, starting time was at 21:00 but it actually began at 21:40\\, after 40 minutes of ads.\\nAt half length of the movie I was sure that I would have preferred to watch 2 hours of ads instead of this garbage.\\nThe plot is written by a monkey\\, simply one of the worst movie I've ever seen.","true":true}
