Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After second viewing with family. I hated the movie the first time I saw it. The milking scene and the Mary Poppins scene were cringe worthy. Rey\u2019s parents... Snoke.... ugh. The problem was I had all these theories in my head going in. Questions I wanted answered. The second time I had a drink before hand and just relaxed. Actually just watched the movie for what it is. It\u2019s actually pretty good. I\u2019m still disappointed some things were not answered and the milking \/ Poppins scenes are still some of the stupidest things I have ever seen in a Star Wars movie... but I actually am ok with this movie. Not what I wanted or expected but good. Here\u2019s hoping JJ Abrams listens to fans and give us some of what we want in this next movie. I understand the anger from core fans. Disney obviously blew us off. Surprising to say the least. You would think they would do some research and provide some of what we wanted and expected. You don\u2019t pay billions of dollars for a franchise only to anger the core group of loyal fans.","true":true}
