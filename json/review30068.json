Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ryan Johnson should be banned to direct or write or even to contribute to any Star Wars movies. He literally f&$& the Star Wars saga. The story\/script is so disappointing. Why Disney gave him full control of the story when he was writing it!? Now I understand why they put JJ for the final movie because they really need something to fix this complete mess that Ryan did! I give 58% for the movie and 25% for the story. I don\u2019t want to give spoilers in my review but man!! I\u2019m so disappointed. I\u2019m going to still watch it 2 more times but\\, I don\u2019t know how JJ will fix all this. Ryan ruined the story!! If you see the Force Awakens and loved the story that JJ created\\, this movie\\, TLJ\\, is doing all the opposite\\, to a point of destroying the story from the TFA. Worst Star Wars movie CERTIFIED","true":true}
