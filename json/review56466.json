Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Farce Awakens\\nIn an apt metaphor for 'The Last Jedi' as a whole\\, Luke Skywalker takes the lightsaber-baton handed to him at the end of J.J. Abrams' safe but rehashed 'The Force Awakens' and blithely tosses it away. In what could have been a moment of subversive genre deconstruction\\, we instead establish the first of many glib evasions that punctuate the emotional tapestry of the movie\\, turning its characters into parody and its scope into farce.\\nThe tone-deaf attempts at humour miserably dilute the most poignant moments of the film\\, as if the director is afraid of the sincerity of the canon he's inherited. I'm all for the shirking of constraints and protocol\\, but 'Star Wars' always worked best as a modern interpretation of mythological themes and archetypes\\, and to sacrifice those themes to clunking irony at the behest of character feels jarring and brutally misplaced. Luke's character\\, in particular\\, is not so much betrayed as assassinated\\, transitioning into a broken and bitter anchorite with the disposition of a wise-cracking\\, petulant teenager. This is not the movie you're looking for.\\nAs with other modern fantasy creations\\, the appeal of the 'Star Wars' universe was multifaceted. The films worked on the level of surface narrative\\, while suggesting a deeper complexity of veiled intrigue and history for fans to explore. 'The Last Jedi' actively undermines this imaginative intrigue by diluting it in the acid of satire and self-parody. Parody is interesting if targeted and\\, as is often noted\\, satire is the cruellest of genres\\, but both parody and satire are unwelcome when they turn against their own source material\\, leaving a mindless and not-as-clever-as-it-thinks encomium to vacuous irony and a demoralised voiding of what once made this series special.","true":true}
