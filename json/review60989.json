We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Spoilers! Don't read if you don't want to be spoiled.Let me start off by saying they killed the main and one of the most beloved character in the game with the first two hours and you only play as Joel for 5 minutes!!!! Thanks Naughty Dog\\, you know how to make people happy!  I also got the impression they we're trying to make Joel out as this bad guy\\, I didn't like that. Deep down we all know Joel was a great person.  Then they make you play this person called Abby after she kills Joel! I didnt care for her character\\,I didn't care about her story. I cared about Joel and Ellie's story that's what I waited seven years for this is what happens when you give Neil druckman full control of the game! Plus to make us play as Abby and make us almost kill Ellie! Man that got my blood boiling. Why make your fans go through this I don't understand\\, are you a so sick deranged person man? The best part of the game were the flashbacks with Ellie and Joel and the graphics. The story was horrible and you're lucky I'm giving it to Stars instead of a zero but I understand a lot of people went through a lot of **** making this game. But\\, maybe just maybe if you would have Joel go out another way people maybe we would appreciate it game more. This is a spit in the face to me and to true fans of this game. Now the ending was horrible\\, we get no satisfaction and everything we go all through with are these emotions are for nothing and to have Ellie be all alone and have nothing left in the end is total BS! These are my opinions about the game and does not mean you will feel the same as me. But\\, you might enjoy it. But for me\\, I didn't and I encourage you all to play it and have your own experience and judgement.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
