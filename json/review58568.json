However\\, some components of toxic players are outrageous\rwilling to throw critics who positively review the game and criticize the game heavily even though not playing it yet seems to make some critics \\\"shaky\\\" (typically Mr. Skill) Upload something) !!! It seems they don't want to \\\"accept the fact that The last of Us 2 is truly excellent\\\". Now\\, any positive review posted online will receive a fair amount of disliked besides the cue lines teased !!!!!\rEveryone\\, please keep an objective attitude about the game\\, not because of the leaks\\, but say the game without thinking !!!
