Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many weird plot holes. Side story seemed to halt the movie . Too many deaths of major characters that didn't make sense or were completely unsatisfying. So much potential wasted. Yoda scene felt like an episode of Sesame Street. Overall dissatisfied. I feel like the director complete disregarded everything Abrams set up in TFA.","true":true}
