Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A decent movie\\, but not a \\\"moving\\\" movie. You remain unengaged by the characters\\, except for Princess Leia's son\\, who is the sole spark of Life in this movie. \\nAlso\\,  I noted was how wooden Carrie Fisher's acting was as well as Mark Hamill's\\, giving a surprising emotion-LESSness to the movie until near the end. Even Laura Dern looked like she'd taken a Valium or two. You just didn't FEEL anything\\, regardless of how enjoyable it was to see Fisher and Hamill onscreen together again. There's no \\\"magic\\\" in this one\\, especially compared to earlier ones. I was surprised how unmoved I was. Fisher just looked like she was tired the whole time she was on the screen\\, something I didn't expect of her. Then again\\, she died a month after the movie wrapped. It was almost a \\\"sobering\\\" feeling throughout\\, despite the action sequences. Perhaps the desperation of the Rebel Resistance was designed to convey that feeling. If so\\, they succeeded magnificently. But that was the only thing magnificent in this episode.","true":true}
