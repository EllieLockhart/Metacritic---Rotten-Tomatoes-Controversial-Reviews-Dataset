Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was better than the last one. Some scenes were reminiscent of previous movies\\, it dragged in the beginning but picked up the pace later. Overall\\, it was a good effort but Lucas would have done better. Loved the score though. ","true":true}
