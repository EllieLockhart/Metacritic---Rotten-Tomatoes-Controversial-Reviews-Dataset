Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\\, like every super fan had to see this movie as soon as it came out\\, but what I got was something completely unexpected. So many character arcs I wanted answers for\\, but instead they cut them all short. In short the only character who received any kind of character building was Poe Dameron. Rose and Finns whole story could have been cut and the movie would have been the same. They took Luke to places that I could never imagine him going.  Princess Leia apparently can fly now( like Superman). Kylo Ren and Rey FaceTime with the force every 20 minutes or so\\, which honestly got a little old. \\nAnother thing that seemed to bother me most is them trying to force the comedy in the movie down your throat. It's almost if Rian was trying to make a SciFi action comedy at points\\, and it left a sour taste in my mouth. \\nAt this point\\, JJ Abrams has his work cut out for him for episode 9. If you were looking for answers to any of the questions in the force awakens\\, you will not find them here.\\nI personally hope they cut the movie from the episode lineup and label it a fan fiction. Because of this movie here\\, if Rian ever makes another starwars movie you can bet your A** I will not see it.\\nTo: JJ Abrams\\, may the force be with you when trying to fix Star Wars.","true":true}
