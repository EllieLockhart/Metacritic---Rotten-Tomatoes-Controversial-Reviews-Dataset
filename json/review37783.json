Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were a lot of nonsensical dialogue and some new uninteresting characters but the movie is exciting and gorgeous. I had a great time watching it.","true":true}
