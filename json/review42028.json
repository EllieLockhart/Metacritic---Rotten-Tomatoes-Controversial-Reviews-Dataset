Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie made Star Wars seem small. They were far too busy making cheap jokes (of a Gaurdians of the Galaxy variety\\, not Han's smooth one-liners from the original) to worry about making a movie that felt like Star Wars. This was exacerbated by how they pushed their many-faceted social justice agenda-issues that I am for\\, to be clear\\, but that felt forced and out of place and even slightly ridiculous in this film.","true":true}
