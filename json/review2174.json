Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A terrible film\\,I deeply regret having seen it. The Story\\, the characters just horrible\\, let alone the End of Luke Skywalker. For me this is definitely the end of the Star Wars saga. I own and read over 60 books and over 70 comics\\, I used to love this universe\\, but now I can only regret that Disney is allowed to destroy this universe by making such horrible movies. In conclusion I can not recommend this film\\, certainly not to a fan and neither to viewer interested in well developed films.","true":true}
