Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The cinematography is gorgeous. That's the only positive comment I can make about this film. Glaring plot holes\\, completely changing characters from the original series and blatant misandry all add up to make this the worst movie I've seen in years. Needless to say\\, I'll be avoiding Episode IX. I don't think I'll ever forgive Disney for destroying my favorite universe.","true":true}
