Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I feel like Disney has ruined a good thing. Just very disappointed in the direction of the movie and the lack of a sound plot.\\nThe best thing about the film was the visual aspects which were done very well.  Not sure that I'm interested in Episide 8","true":true}
