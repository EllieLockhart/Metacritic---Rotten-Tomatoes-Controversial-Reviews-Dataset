Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i would say this is pretty bad because they ignored alot of big questions asked in previous movie as well as huge plot holes everywhere.\\n\\ni will name a few things i think is wrong with this movie.\\nignored all questions the force awaken left us with\\nuntrained rey can use the force to move hundres of pounds of rocks easier than luke and yoda can move a x-wing\\, she also spreads them to two piles so the cast can walk through them without breaking a sweat.\\nfirst order can't light spead ahead to blockade the rebels.\\nif they could kamakazi at light speed why didn't they do it right off the bat and let the rest of the ships escape in light speed?\\ncasino planet is a big filler and adds nothing to the story unless that kid at the end gets recruited and turns jedi.","true":true}
