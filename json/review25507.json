Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No spoilers here\\, but just wanted to say that I saw the Last Jedi. If you would have told me that I could watch new Star Wars movies with original cast that would make me miss the prequels I would have thought you were insane. The only thing I can think of is that these movies are being written for folks that didn't really watch or read any other Star Wars at all. Rogue One was great\\, that guy got it\\, but episode 7 and 8 not sure what going on there. Don't get me wrong the writing on these two movies is a 1000x better than that of the prequels but maybe the difference is that Lucas at least knew his characters. No one since his selling of Star Wars seems to. Fine movie\\, if I had never read or seen Star Wars before I would have loved it. Check out the Mark Hamil interviews\\, he knows what I am talking about. Wish they would have just left the original cast out. On the positive side\\, Poe and BB8 relationship is adorable\\, if you have a dog who is also your best friend it makes total sense. ","true":true}
