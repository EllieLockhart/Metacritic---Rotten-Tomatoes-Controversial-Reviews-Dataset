Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is so much potential or you can say expectation that there is a high possibility for disappointed. I feel that JJ Abrams should have made the movie so I have some \u201chope\u201d hearing that he is doing the next one. There are some nice scenes and there are scenes that make you scratch your head. The force is becoming to easy attainable without training. Some things are not even believable. Too many will this person die. Mark Hamil is awesome as an actor but I feel he could have better material. It\u2019s basically written for children. Some stuff is just so cringe worthy. Especially the inappropriate humor that was just awkward. It\u2019s 2.5 hours but actually they needed to edit out 30 min of rubbish ","true":true}
