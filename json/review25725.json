Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a Star Wars core fan. Found the movie to be long with unnecessary plots\\, same repetitive space ship fights\\, and a lot of cliches. Some parts involving Rey\\, Luke and Kylo were good but character development was confusing. Overall an average at the very best.","true":true}
