Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible. Just nonsensical and contrived the whole way through. There are so many idiotic plot holes in this movie that I was amazed something like this was even made\\, and the critics reviews is so idiotic that  I will never again bother with  what the critics say. This movie is objectively bad. It has stunning visuals\\, but  that is just not enough for a movie. I am not much of a star wars fan\\, having only watched the prequels (and been thoroughly unimpressed by them)\\, but even those movies were much better than this. This movie is just so dumb that it reminded me of movies like Jupiter Ascending\\, and the Transformer movies. Just spectacle and no substance. Characters are bland and their motivations are ridiculous\\, out of place humor that falls flat\\, and some of the worst scenes I have ever seen in a movie (old woman floating back from outer space through some magical power). I love sci fi\\, but this movie is just garbage. I can't believe this is the same director behind Looper. That movie was excellent.","true":true}
