Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was the movie visually stunning...absolutely\\, but I left the theater kind of empty as I felt like they killed Luke in more ways than one. I feel like this is no longer the Skywalker family saga as it was meant to me.  Just disappointed. That's the word I think of the most. I'm not angry\\, but disappointed at what I feel was a wasted opportunity. I get wanting to establish the new cast\\, but you don't have to take a dump on the former to get it done.  Will be really interesting to see how JJ handles IX. Think a lot of newer\/younger fans will like this more than those that grew up on the OT.","true":true}
