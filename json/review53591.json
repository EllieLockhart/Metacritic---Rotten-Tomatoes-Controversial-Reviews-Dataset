Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic\\, surprising\\, and every bit a Star Wars movie. I was exhilarated from start to finish\\, and loved both the development of new characters and fleshing out of those players we met in Force Awakens. This Star Wars defies the rules at every turn\\, but never leaves you feeling lost in space. I would challenge those who may be up in arms or indignant about this 'upset' to take a good look at Episodes 4-6. As if there weren't head-turning twists in the original trilogy! If you like your movies to predictably recycle the same old tropes and give you the same staid characters of yore\\, this ain't the movie you're looking for \ud83d\udcab\u270b\ud83c\udffd But if you are here for the best parts about Star Wars stories\\, big laughs\\, occasional tears\\, daring heroics and tenebrous evildoers\\, saddle up. The Force is strong with The Last Jedi.","true":true}
