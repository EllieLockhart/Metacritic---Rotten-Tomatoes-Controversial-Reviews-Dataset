Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed the improvements that were made on top of the movie such as the AT-AT walkers on steroids and CGI. I didn't care for the story and the lack of urgency throughout the movie. The overall tone and usual seriousness of star wars just wasn't there. I won't be watching any new star wars after this ones unless it's something closer more mature.","true":true}
