Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a mess. I came out of the cinema confused and emotionally all over the place. The film tried to fit way to much into its runtime\\, which only resulted in its main plots feeling weak\\, as they weren't developed properly. Both Finn and Poe's stories were\\, in the end\\, pointless\\, and Rey and Kylo's storyline was left feeling weak and out of character because it was not given enough time to feel well rounded. In each thread of the story the tone flip flopped between serious drama and slapstick comedy at the drop of the hat\\, leaving almost all of the scenes empty of emotional impact\\, because they didn't give the audience any time to process what was happening. A hot fucking mess to be quite honest.","true":true}
