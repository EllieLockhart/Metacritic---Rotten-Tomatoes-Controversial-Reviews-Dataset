Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It looks good\\, there's lots of cool design choices and effects\\, the actors are great specifically Hamill.\\nBut poor character development\\, poor world building and a really awful plot are where this fails. \\nThe Force Awakens provided a wealth of plot holes to fill and build a new mythos around and opportunities for a hypothetically great sequel\\, this one may as well have come out of left field with no concern for a continuous storyline. \\nObjectively it's terrible and I hope I never have to see Rian Johnson torture an audience ever again. Lucasfilm\/Disney\\, please for the love of god cancel his trilogy.","true":true}
