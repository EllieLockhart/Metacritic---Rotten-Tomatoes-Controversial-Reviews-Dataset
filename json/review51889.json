Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A few visually great sequences but overall cringeworthy edition to Star Wars. Badly used the characters and introduced too many new characters that have no real influence on the story. A couple of cringey jokes and lines that just ruined it a bit. Also think the camera was out of focus slightly on a shot of Mark Hamil. Not the greatest cinematography for a Star Wars film in all honesty. The best shots in the film were full VFX shots that probably had more direction from the VFX artist and supervisors (not the director\/cinematographer!)","true":true}
