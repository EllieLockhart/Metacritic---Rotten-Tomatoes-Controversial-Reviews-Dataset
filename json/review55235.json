Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just no... fell asleep twice in the cinema watching this non-event of a \u00e2~movie\u00e2(TM). Kanto Byte scene is a waste\\, Luke is not the Luke I remember\\, as a matter of fact his character is destroyed here. Rey overcomes all obstacles without earning her power (again) and all the plot lines set up in TFA are lost in this film....\\n\\nThis trilogy will not be canon in my house.... terrible and unwatchable","true":true}
