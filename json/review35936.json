Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is what happens when a hack writer with no vision or respect for a pre-existing franchise destroys beloved characters and introduces plot holes in the name of \\\"deconstruction.\\\" Avoid this film like the plague.","true":true}
