Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is kind of one long \\\"force chat\\\" between Ben and Rey.  At one point\\, Snoke starts to troll their relationship so he gets cut off the call.  Luke is kind of a father figure that says stay away from that boy!  They cut him off of the call too.  At one point\\, Ben turns the conversation into a video chat showing Rey his abs\\, this makes her uncomfortable and she decides she needs some distance but he still might make a good mate down the road.","true":true}
