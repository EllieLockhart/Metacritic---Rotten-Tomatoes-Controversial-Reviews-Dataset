Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Being old enough to have watched every movie of this franchise in theater\\, building the excitement and anticipation of the \\\"next part of the story to come\\\"\\, I was terribly disappointed and deflated for this installment. The utter and complete void where a story should of been being the primary deflating catalyst. This hollow commercialization of the 'Star Wars franchise story' has just left me empty and sad. This felt very similar to playing the battlefront II game\\, 'join the game\\, mindless killing in a tremendously rendered environment for 30 minutes\\, then move on to something else'. So very hollow and disappointing. For me\\, \\\"if there is no story\\, you have no movie\\\". This wasn't a movie but a snapshot in time of the Star Wars universe with no explanations rendered. Please bring the story back! or your fans won't be. I will be waiting for the disc for the next installment to see if we get \\\"the return of the franchised story\\\". (perhaps a good title for the next installment)","true":true}
