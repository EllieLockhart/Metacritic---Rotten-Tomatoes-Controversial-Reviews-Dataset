Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One positive is this movie is probably the most visually appealing of all the Star Wars films\\, but for me\\, that's pretty much where the positives stop. \\n\\nThis movie is full of plot holes\\, inconsistencies with the rest of the franchise\\, poor character development\\, and things that just make no sense whatsoever. I'm not going to type them all out\\, but basically YouTube any reviews of this film\\, and you'll see its many problems. \\n\\nMany longtime Star Wars fans despise this film\\, and understandably so. I'm glad there are those who can like it\\, but people who don't like this movie are being shamed as \\\"fanboys\\\" or \\\"misogynists.\\\" I'm not going to get into the politics\\, that in my opinion this movie DOES force down your throat\\, but even those issues notwithstanding\\, this movie is filled with problems.","true":true}
