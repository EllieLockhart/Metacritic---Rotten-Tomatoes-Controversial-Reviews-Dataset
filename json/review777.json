Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An enjoyable\\, but not perfect movie.Takes a whole new direction to the Star Wars films of old\\, which has me excited for future instalments. It seems many complained that VII followed the formula too closely\\, and yet VIII is now wildly too different. I guess you can't please everyone.","true":true}
