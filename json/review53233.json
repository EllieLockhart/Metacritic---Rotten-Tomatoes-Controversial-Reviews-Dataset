Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bottom Line: Disney has told fans that it has out grown them and deliberate seeks to alienate them in favor of a new audience without character-loyalty.  Spaceballs meets Guardians of the Galaxy. The movie is a thin plot clearly meant to move beyond the Skywalkers by making Luke into a complete and total idiot. Humor destroys all sense of drama\\, and a massive fleet cannot overpower one ship's shields. Abhorrent writing.","true":true}
