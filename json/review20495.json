Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a star wars fan since the start but New Hope and Empire Strikes Back still are my favorite for story and acting by a mile.  Last Jedi seemed average of the pack with a lot of the same and thus predictable story lines.  I was impressed with Mark Hamill and Daisy Ridley in their acting and role.","true":true}
