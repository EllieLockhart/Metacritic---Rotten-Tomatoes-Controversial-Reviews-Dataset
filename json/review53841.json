Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Here is the deal: Disney bought this franchise to make money. They do not care about the fans as anything but sources of revenue. To them the fans are morons that paid George Lucas hundreds of millions of dollars for the subpar\\, to put it kindly\\, prequels. The powers that be at Disney do not understand Star Wars\\, and they do not care. It does not matter to them that they broke the laws of the universe by having Holdo crash her ship at light speed into the First Order ship. It does not matter to them that they portrayed Luke Skywalker as a coward and a quitter. People paid them hundreds of millions of dollars to watch The Last Jedi. THAT is all that they care about.","true":true}
