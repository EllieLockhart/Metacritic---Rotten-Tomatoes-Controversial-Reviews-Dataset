Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you are a fan of Star Wars\\, the mythos\\, the adventure\\, the characters then look no further than this unique and fun film that steps out of the preordained path of mimicking the originals to take Star Wars into places it has not been except in Expanded Universe. This is the first time I have seen this series take a unique approach since Disney purchased it\\, and it comes off as the best film since Empire Strikes Back. Rian Johnson crafts an amazing story inspired by the past history of Star Wars\\, including many subtle nods to Knights of the Old Republic and other beloved Expanded Universe material\\, and creates something wholly its own from it. If you love Star Wars as much as I do you have to see this film\\, it is the Star Wars movie we've always deserved.","true":true}
