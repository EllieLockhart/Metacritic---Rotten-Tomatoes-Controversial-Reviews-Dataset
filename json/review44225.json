Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Took aaages to get going but when it did\\, holy fuck did it. Could have had a section in the middle taken out and a couple of plot points resolved quicker but the action and the art direction really shine\\, covering some of the flaws. Hamill reminds us just how good he can be and the supporting cast all give their all. I\u0092ll watch it again and rate it more fairly then\\, having suppressed the fanboy in me\\, but I really enjoyed it.","true":true}
