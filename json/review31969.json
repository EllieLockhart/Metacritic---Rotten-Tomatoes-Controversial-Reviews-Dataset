Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS AHEAD\\nAfter countless hours of sitting at home\\, and wondering what happened with the force awakens I was left with tons of questions \\\"who is smoke?  Who are Ray's parents? Why did they kill Han Solo so quickly?\\\" and to my disbelief none of these questions were answered.  The opening scene with Leia flying through space was CRINGEY!  We wait years to find out that Ray's parents are common junkers?  The fight scene with snoke's guards and kylo ren and ray was AMAZING. that was literally the only reason I gave the movie half a star.  Pretty to watch is about what I will be able to tell my friends and family about this awful movie.  Disney needs to quit ruining franchises for the bottom dollar.","true":true}
