Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Messy\\, with lacking structure\\, characters that are neither meaningful nor interesting nor coherent. Too long. Too much stupid slapstick. \\nA few awesome looking scenes but with no point. Two major character deaths that don't mean anything. And a never ending side story on a casino planet that feels  extremely out of place (concerning story relevance and visuals and atmosphere). It's like a big f**k you to everything they managed to set up in \\\"The Force Awakens\\\". \\nI have exactly zero interest in watching episode 9 now.","true":true}
