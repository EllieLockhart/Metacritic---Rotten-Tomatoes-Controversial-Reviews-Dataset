Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After only one viewing it's hard to give a just review. But overall\\, I enjoyed it much more than VII\\, and many things that I didn't like about VII were made better by this movie. Rian Johnson is a visionary\\, and I give him credit for martyring himself to create this beautiful film. OT Fanboys will probably hate it. PT Fanboys will enjoy the few reference bones they are thrown. True fans will love the evolution of the series.","true":true}
