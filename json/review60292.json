Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"First the  attention to details in this game is phenomenal\\, the gameplay feels satisfying \\,and the graphics one of  the best out there\\, However all I mentioned was present in the first game \\,sure it has improved a lot \\, but that's technology \\, we shouldn't judge the game by these aspects but by the story\\,\\, The idea is smart \\,the execution was horrible \\, the game is based around characters doing stupid decisions \\,2 or 3 bad decisions we might understand but the game is filled with them \\, the characters are nothing like the  ones we've seen in the first game \\, they lost everything defining them and that is annoying  abby is not likeable at all \\,\\,the game failed at making me build any sympathy for her \\, abby and ellie are both unlikable in this game and this is coming from a fan of the first game \\, the only one I liked was Joel he did bad stuff but reddemed himself  and he was portrayed as this evil monster At the end I felt no progress whatsoever \\, the abby hours felt boring and annoying and added nothing to the story \\, the game is all about killing people we spend hours murdering people in cold blood  that had nothing to do with abby and  were only protecting their land \\,\\, and when one of abby's friends die ellie feels bad for it \\, it's weird and forced \\, the only good parts were Joel and ellie's flashbacks \\, they took everything that made the first game brilliant and just destroyed it Revenge is bad for ellie and good for abby huh \\,what a Joke \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,To quote Joel's words \\\"SEE THERE WAS A SEQUEL \\, \\,\\,WASN'T AS GOOD .\u2026 Expand","true":true}
