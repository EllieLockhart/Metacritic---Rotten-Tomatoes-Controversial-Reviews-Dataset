Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the visuals are admittedly an improvement over the other films (this apparently being the first to discover the color red can be used for something other than blaster fire) the story and characters are not only a mess\\, they are downright insulting. Rian Johnson's apparent need to subvert the audience's expectations and avoid following fan theories left the old and new characters acting in ways that make little-to-no sense. I was not a fan of The Force Awakens but I saw that there was potential if certain plot elements were explored in the movies following it... this unfortunately was not the case. I will not be seeing Episode 9 as this movie has made me refuse to further fund these soulless continuations of a timeless and iconic story.","true":true}
