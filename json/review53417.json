Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney gave the keys of the kingdom to a freestyler\\, Rian Johnson. Johnson tried to be original and break new ground - but he failed to realise Star Wars was a success because fans were emotionally invested in the characters. Luke lost his adopted parents\\, mentor and had his limb slashed away by an evil father. Despite this adversity\\, he saved the galaxy and forgave his father. Who has sacrificed anything in TLJ? Why should the fans care? Instead\\, Rian Johnson denigrated the one character who fans actually cared about - Luke. No wonder Mark Hamill was so appalled when he read the script. The character he loved would never act this way. Added to all this\\, there is gaping plot holes\\, poor pacing and numerous important unanswered questions. \\n\\nThis is the beginning of the end for Star Wars - the franchise has lost its loyal fan base. The wreckage is so great\\, it's impossible for JJ to piece together a worthy finally instalment. He might be able to squeeze some juice out of Rey and Kylo (the only developed character) to pull off something adequate\\, but the magic is gone.
