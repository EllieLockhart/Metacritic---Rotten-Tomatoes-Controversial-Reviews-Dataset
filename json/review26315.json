Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not the Star Wars I grew up with. A very well made film\\, but a terribly made Star Wars film. Takes very little consideration of established lore and in my opinion nearly ruins the character of Luke Skywalker. I write this after watching The Rise of Skywalker however\\, and I am happy to say it fixes a lot of what I disliked in this film.","true":true}
