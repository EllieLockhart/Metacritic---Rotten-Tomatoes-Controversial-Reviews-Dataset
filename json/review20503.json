Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been hearing too many excuses for why this film is receiving a LOW audience rating; fans still upset over the SW Legends\/Canon controversy\\, sexist men who don't like a woman protagonist\\, yesterday I even heard it was DC comics fans upset over those movies under-performing so to get at Marvel\/Disney are taking it out on Disney owned Star Wars. What's next\\, Russian hackers? I made an account here specifically to make my own feelings clear and join the chorus of people who are rejecting this movie (and with good reason.)\\n\\n  I was actually angry the night after watching this film\\, thinking it over. I don't remember the last time a movie made me actually angry about it. This movie hurt all Star Wars lore (canonical and otherwise) that came before it in such a way that it made all three prequel trilogy movies better by comparison.\\n\\n  At least when George Lucas made the prequels they stayed true to how the Star Wars universe functioned\\, even the creation of midoclorians (although contentious) didn't negate the use for some learning\\, training and practice to use force abilities and martial skill. Yes\\, fighting with lightsabers was always helped by use of the force (hence why non-force wielders typically didn't use the Jedi weapon) but it was always backed up with skills honed over time. \\n\\n  As if to really drive the point home\\, they have Rey beat up frickin' Luke Skywalker in a stick fight!?!?  All of the excuses fans were making for Rey during The Force Awakens prove to be nothing\\, because her parents were apparently nobody. The Force just \\\"decided\\\" to give her immense power because Kylo Ren turned to the Dark Side. This is why Rey can speak any alien language? Why she can drive any vehicle as well as fix them? Why she can fight on par with Luke Skywalker\\, and is able to use force abilities (like the Jedi mind trick) without ever having seen them performed? She even lifts half a mountain of boulders and makes sure to hold them up long enough to show the resistance what she was doing\\, only setting them down after they've witnessed her effortless miracle. Us longtime Star Wars fans are expected to swallow ALL of this just because Kylo Ren dared to go to the darkside so the Force of it's own accord \\\"chose\\\" to grant Rey unprecedented native talent with the force?\\n\\n  They've decimated the idea that skills in the force and lightsabers have to be developed over time. Rey has had NO training in these things but can compete with or defeat Kylo Ren who's been trained by Luke AND Snoke. Why? Because the force likes to equalize things\\, that makes ZERO sense in the traditional context established in the Star Wars Universe. Even though Luke didn't train for that long before defeating Vader he at least spent SOME time learning from Yoda and briefly a bit with Obi Wan\\, and Luke LOST his first battle against Vader.\\n\\n  Anakin as a preteen had experience as a pod racer - somewhat translatable to flying a small spacecraft with the help of R2-D2. It was luck (the force) that guided him into the vulnerable part of the CIS spacestation in the Phantom Menace\\, where he was able to cause it's destruction.\\n  That's different than expecting the force to unlock a skill in a martial art. I don't know why people can't see the difference. If this was a man\\, a boy\\, an alien or a purple penguin it wouldn't matter. It's ridiculous to believe that everyone who has a problem with Rey being able to do EVERYTHING she tries is just an issue of sexism.\\n\\n  My issue is Rey being good at EVERYTHING she tries\\, no training\\, no practice\\, no significant effort. She was a Mary Sue in The Force Awakens and instead of checking that or giving it a good explanation in The Last Jedi Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson double down and make her Mary Sue-ness even more blatant and put together a whole movie which says\\, \\\"Its time to let old things die.\\\" with a sort of subtle messaging to tell us they don't care about continuity\\, or the way things have been working for decades\\, the logic of the whole SW Universe.\\n\\n  The feminist agenda supercedes the importance of sticking to established and even REASONABLE sensibilities in the minds of showrunners Ms Kennedy and Mr Johnson. Third Wave Feminism is only ONE of the many agenda driven messages included in this piece. I lost count of the number of times the characters speak of the #resistance\\, beating us over the head with where they stand in American politics. Maybe someone can tally that up eventually.\\n\\n  Those were just my own biggest gripes over the film\\, other more dedicated reviewers have gone into much greater detail\\, and listed more of it's many problems.\\n\\n  So\\, Disney-Kennedy & Johnson want to hide behind excuses for apparent audience rejection of their piece of crap film. Unbelievable!","true":true}
