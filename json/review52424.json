Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A great movie in itself\\, just disappointed on the emphasis between a forbidden bond between the main protag and genocidal antag over exploring Kylo Ren and Finn as darkside foils. So much sexual subtext and symbolism left a puzzling moral conundrum. They tried to force a reverse Anakin\/Padme too much\\, when Kylo is too far into evil for condonable redemption and deep connection.","true":true}
