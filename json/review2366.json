Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At time of viewing it was entertaining - upon reflection\\, however\\, its a badly written and uninspiring mess.","true":true}
