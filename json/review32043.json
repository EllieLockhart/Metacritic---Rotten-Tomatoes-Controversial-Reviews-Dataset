Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*Spoilers*\\nGood: \\n- Amazing performances from the whole cast. Did not expect to end up rooting for Ben (especially after how obnoxious Kylo was in tfa)\\n- Beautiful set design\\n- Diverse cast\\n\\nBad:\\n- Slopy transitions between story lines\\n- Weak film score\\n- Too much CGI\\, not enough practical effects\\n- Casino scenes \\n\\nUgly:\\n- The first 75% of the movie had one distinct underlying theme (breaking the wheel of war\\, ending the Jedi and the sith\\, abolishing absolutes in favor of balance). After  the crash at light speed\\, the theme suddenly changed to \\\"we must keep up this fight where people keep dying because that's just what we do\\\"\\n- The ending. I was really hoping Kylo and Rey would team up to dimantile the machine perpetuating the war (which would have justified the casino misadventure) but I guess Disney execs vetoed that anti-capitalist message\\n-","true":true}
