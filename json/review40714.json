Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This looks and feels like a Star Wars movie\\, but be assured that the plot is not the much-repeated themes that we've seen before.  I greatly enjoyed going to see it\\, but if you expect a repeat of Episodes IV\\, V\\, or VI\\, you'll be disappointed.\\n\\nIt's visually stunning to say the least\\, and I loved seeing what would happen in certain battle circumstances (sorry\\, don't want to give too much away\\, but you'll know what I mean when you see some of the space fighting scenes).","true":true}
