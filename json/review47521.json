Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What on earth people are on about!!?? People moaning and groaning about Disney killing Star Wars? Killing off the original story lines? What do you people want to see? The same film every year over and over again?? That would be boring and predictable! A story line needs to move on to be interesting but it\u0092s still Star Wars. Stop living in the past!\\nThis Star Wars film is the best so far. Visually is incredible and the story line has taken it to another level whilst keeping the Star Wars integrity. Loved ever minute of the film\\, 2hours and 40 minuets flew by and I did not want the film to finish because I was enjoying it so much.\\nWell done Disney you are nailing it. Keep it up.","true":true}
