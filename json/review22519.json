Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let me start by saying that I am not a hardcore Star Wars fanboy and I've only followed Star Wars through the the major films.  I'm reviewing this movie based only one viewing and I have to say I left the theater feeling somewhat disappointed and empty.  I didn't feel the force with this one.  Without spoiling the movie\\, overall I felt the movie lacked depth in character development for the main characters\\, and focused too much on support characters.  A lot of scenes felt cut off short and plot development  felt forced\\, unnatural\\, and inconsequential.  Now without a doubt there were some very memorable and beautiful scenes in this movie\\, but overall they felt fleeting.  The good parts of the story that actually felt fitting as a sequel to The Force Awakens and Star Wars story in general seemed to be overtaken and overcast by a side story that I could care less for.","true":true}
