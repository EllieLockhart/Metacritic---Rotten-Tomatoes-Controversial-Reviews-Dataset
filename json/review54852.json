Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I totally understand the movie. It went in the direction it had to go. Obi Wan Kenobi evaporated the same way Luke does in this movie 30 years ago. He did his part and stepped aside for the new characters to resolve their own conflict and create balance. It's what's supposed to happen weather we like it or not. When Yoda let the temple burn Luke was shocked but it served it's purpose. Let the past die is what he says. Nothing will ever replace the original 3 movies. Honestly looking back I wish they let the whole series die after the first 3. But it makes a billion dollars a film so they are gonna keep making them","true":true}
