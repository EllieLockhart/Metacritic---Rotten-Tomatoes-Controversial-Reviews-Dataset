Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ep. 8 is a miserable movie; it finished destroying Luke's character\\, it provided no development for Rey at all\\, it provided an unsatisfying end to Snoke without revealing the mystery\\, it completely fails to explain why the First Order exists\\, why its so powerful and what happened to the New Republic\\, and due to their collective idiocy the Resistance is gone. There's no need to make another movie. The shark is jumped. Stop. Please let this be the Last movie about Jedi. If they Return from this\\, it'll only make it worse.","true":true}
