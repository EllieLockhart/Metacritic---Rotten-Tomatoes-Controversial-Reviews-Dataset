Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fun\\,  exciting and surprising. A true star wars movie. Not the best one\\, but certainly not the worst. The haters need to calm down and enjoy it for what it is.","true":true}
