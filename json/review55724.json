Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot holes\\, plot holes\\, plot holes. Should have been a great movie\\, instead it was just meh. They didn't take their writing seriously and is filled with contradictions and other rookie mistakes. There is just too much wrong with this movie. One more round of editing could have make world of difference.  I would have cut most of the casino sub plot. Either Phantasm should have been removed or have her actually doing something like fight a clean up mission against the rebels and a meeting with with the other Order leaders where they give a plausible reason for the who chase scene. There is no real character development for anyone.  Finn or Rose should have died taking out the cannon.","true":true}
