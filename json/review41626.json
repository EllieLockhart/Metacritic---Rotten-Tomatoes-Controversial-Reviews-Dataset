Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is horrible if you're a Star Wars fan. Filled with moments that rival the introduction of midichlorians. All space combat rendered pointless due to the ability to weaponize light speed. Luke attempting to kill his nephew because he showed some dark side in him. He believed he could turn his mass murderer father from the dark side but can't help his sisters son who has done nothing wrong? Canto Bight was the lowest point in all of Star Wars. How this story was thought to be a good idea is beyond me. The plot is a car chase in space at the speed of the steamroller moment in Austin Powers. As a Star Wars fan all my life\\, I couldn't find any moments in this film that were at least interesting to watch. The prequels were terrible but we got incredible moments in them\\, such as pod racing\\, light saber fights\\, space combat\\, etc etc. There are no moments in this film that were even fan service.","true":true}
