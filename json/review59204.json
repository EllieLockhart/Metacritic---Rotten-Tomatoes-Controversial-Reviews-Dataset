Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"No character development\\, Abby was more interesting then ellie. Still hasnt addressed ellies immunity\\, I highly doubt there was only one person alive that could develop a cure. Bouts of long exploration followed by 10 minutes of action\\, exploration was boring. Forced you to explore for collectibles. I was more interested in the story from the letters then the games story. Completely mealiness ending\\, kills everyone else for revenge but the person who actually killed joel\\, even kills a pregnant woman. Forced ending\\, forces you to fight a group with no context besides that they take prisoners for forced labor. Ellie loses her fingers in the last fight and cant leave joels guitar legacy behind unless she learns to play the guitar lefty. Very poorly written and leaves you with more questions about what happens at the end. Unfulfilling.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
