Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poor story-telling\\, with little to no character development for the new characters introduced in this trilogy. Sub-plot unrelated and inconsequential to the greater story of the movie\\, and the saga as a whole. Johnson\u0092s use of poorly-timed comedy delegitimizes the dire situations the protagonists find themselves in. \u0093Let the past die\u0094 because Star Wars isn\u0092t special anymore.","true":true}
