Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is one of the worst Star Wars films ever made. Change is normally a good thing\\, but no one likes their heroes deconstructed. This was not Luke Skywalker\\, this was not the Force\\, and it certainly did not feel like Star Wars. Some of the ideas were good\\, but most of the execution\\, clumsy dialogue\\, and jokes that failed to land were not. Rian Johnson ruined the amazing climactic ending to The Force Awakens with one stupid joke and a toxic take on Luke Skywalker. I will not see another film under his care. Would Luke Skywalker brush the dust off his should like some spaghetti western cowboy? Would he quip\\, \\\"See you\\, later kid?\\\" like he's Dirty Harry? Moreover\\, would act in a way unfitting of one whose life is one with The Force? No\\, no\\, no... Lastly\\, those fish-like nuns who take care of the Jedi island belong in the same corner of the Star Wars universe as Jar Jar Binks... Could that corner be the awful casino world revealed in this film? So very disappointing.","true":true}
