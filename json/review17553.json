Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I signed up to this site just to make sure that Disney Executives understand that the Audience Score on this site is valid and relevant and isn't some made up\\, hacked or false indication of what ordinary people thought of this movie. It's real. This movie fails on all levels and is the weakest of all the Star Wars Movies. This was the only Star Wars movie screening I have attended where the audience didn't cheer\\, clap or react to what they were viewing. The total opposite to the screening of the force Awakens\\, where audience members cheered and clapped throughout the movie! As for the so-called movie critics were they watching the same film as the rest of us?\\nWatch this movie to see how poor writing can create obvious narrative problems. I feel the majority of Star Wars fans didn't like direction taken by The Last Jedi and the film does have some major flaws (hyperspace ramming\\, flying Princess Leia \\, bombs falling in space\\, but to name but a few) not to mention political ideology and feminist propaganda which has been so obviously placed front right and centre\\, in a Star Wars film. In the original Star wars Princess Leia was a strong female lead character\\, well written and well acted not just placed there to push a view point or an agenda!\\nMain stream media insinuates that the Star Wars fan base is made up of primarily older white males\\, who are all toxic\\, sexist\\, racist\\, misogynistic bigots\\, man babies to name but a few. There's a big difference between having an opinion\\, criticising something or hounding someone for no good reason. What I personally feel is wrong though\\, is that Directors\\, Writers\\, the Creative team and Representatives at Lucasfilm keep on attacking the Star Wars Fan base\\, as a unit\\, on all media platforms.\\nI believe that everyone has a right to an opinion about movies and if a successful franchise is being steered in the wrong direction\\, then fans should have a right to express this in a constructive way.  Director Rian Johnson cannot handle any form of criticism regarding The Last Jedi in any way and will retaliate publically with words such as unhealthy and man babies. As he is so self absorbed he has stated he will not listen to the fans and ignore them (subvert expectations) reject all criticism and make the film\\, as he sees it? Is it not the ordinary fans that by spending their hard earned cash on everything related to the Star Wars saga\\, which made it the success it is today? Are we not important? It seems so!\\nStar Wars Fans are a broad church and their only concerns are with getting a good story and a good film. This is a P.R disaster for all concerned\\, especially the person in charge of production namely Kathleen Kennedy. Kathleen Kennedy who is responsible for firing Phil Lord and Chris Miller so far into production of Solo and then firing acclaimed Director Colin Trevorrow for episode 9 losing Lucas film millions of dollars. Continuing attacks on the main fan base by the main stream media\\, the loss of revenue is a direct result of the fans becoming disillusioned with the whole franchise\\, don't throw away what took 40 years to build up! The force is not female Kathleen Kennedy\\, it is neither male or female! So let's take on board what the fans are asking for and move forward.","true":true}
