Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poor writing\\, plot holes\\, and more original trilogy shake and bake layered with arbitrary twists. I feel bad for the actors\\, who are doing great work with poor material\\, especially Boyega\\, who was totally wasted in this film. Kylo Ren continues to be the least compelling villain I've ever seen and Rey got flattened out into a cardboard character. Not to mention the poor pacing and plethora of plot holes. I won't even be bothering with the next one.","true":true}
