Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have no issues with the trajectory Rian Johnson sent the saga on\\, I have a major problem of how it came togther in his movie.  I liked moments of this movie\\, but as a movie\\, it was a hot mess.  This wasn't about disappointing fanboys\\, this was about failing to live up to the previous film and provide continuity\\, as well as an inability to tell a story without using preachy dialogue to over explain why the story matters.","true":true}
