Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm posting after having seen the movie a second time to confirm my opinion. This movie was an attack against true Star Wars fans. \\\"Let the past die. Kill it if you have to.\\\" This was the studio talking to SW fans. The rules of the universe no longer apply. The universe we've spent decades studying and learning about is foreign to me now\\, and I don't like it. Now\\, anyone can be the greatest Force user ever\\, WITHOUT ANY TRAINING (Leia\\, Rey). The worst infraction was Luke's personality. Luke has always been the goody-two shoes of the group\\, the Captain America\\, if you will. This is not a bad thing\\, it was necessary. I'm also not opposed to Luke changing\\, the same way I enjoyed Cap becoming darker. But with Cap\\, we SEE why he changed\\, we can understand why he changed. The last we saw of Luke\\, he had just SUCCESSFULLY turned Vader from the Dark Side. This should reinforce his belief that he can help bring people back to the Light. But with no viable explaination\\, Luke is ready to kill Ben because he MIGHT one day become evil? That's not Luke. You didn't give us a viable explaination and thus killed Luke's personality for no reason. There are so many other issues I have\\, the plot holes\\, the military tactics\\, the political brainwashing\\, but the biggest issue is that the creators have no idea what Star Wars is. My case in point\\, is that the line \\\"Godspeed\\\" would not be in a Star Wars movie. If the creators knew Star Wars\\, they would have known this.","true":true}
