Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Truly my favorite of the entire Star Wars franchise. Walked out of the theater on a cloud. Finally heroes and villains who aren't mere cardboard cutouts but show humor\\, empathy and most importantly a struggle with the decisions they have made and must continue to make. Mark Hamill's performance as a grizzled Luke Skywalker was a beautiful redemption of what I always felt was the most weakly portrayed and insufficiently developed character in the  original trilogy. He lent this film the sagacity and gravitas required of a future classic in cinema history\\, which is what I do believe The Last Jedi will eventually become. Well done to Rian Johnson and the team for having the guts to revolutionize a franchise that was in need of a systems upgrade.","true":true}
