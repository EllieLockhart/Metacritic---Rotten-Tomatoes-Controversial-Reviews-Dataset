Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where to start on this dumpster fire. Visually I would say this is almost a 5 star. Character\\, story\\, development\\, canon\\, believability and flow don't deserve half a star. I won't be watching the next movie. Good luck Disney. Lol no quotes yet? Not surprising very forgettable. ","true":true}
