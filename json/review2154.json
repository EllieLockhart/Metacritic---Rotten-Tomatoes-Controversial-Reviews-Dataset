Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At 2 1\/2 hours\\, this movie is an hour too long. The plot\\, characters and special effects are the same as all the other Star Wars movies. Ask me in a week what the plot of this movie was\\, and I won't be able to tell you.","true":true}
