Sadly the awkward pacing of this game's story due to flashbacks and character switches removes from the emersion which the previous factors tried so hard to achieve.\r\rI have completed this game as I wanted to give this thing a chance\\, so I remained open-minded about the character arc of Abby and pushed through the needless potholes that this game has to offer. Upon completion I can safely say I do not feel that this game pays off in any shape or form\\, the story seems utterly pointless and disconnected from the characters and world that we came to cherish within the first title. The actions and decisions of Ellie throughout this game lead to nothing and has left me confused about what the message of this game is. The ending could have been resolved by offering the play a multiple choice of either killing or sparing Abby; making for the 10 hours of Abby gameplay mean something.\r\rIt is such as shame because this game will influence how I view Naughty Dog in regards to future titles\\, as I am sure it will be the case for many other gamers. This is a game that doesn't need to be played. This is a game that is not a must-have\\, unlike its predecessor\\, The Last of Us Part 1.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
