Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I don't understand the low ratings\\, but each to their own. Personally I thought there were enough nods to the original trilogy to keep the old school fans happy\\, while still looking to the future. It effectively handed over the continuation of the story to the next generation. I guess some 'fans' don't like the idea that things have to move on. The OT will always be there and I will always love it\\, but I enjoyed seeing something new and different.","true":true}
