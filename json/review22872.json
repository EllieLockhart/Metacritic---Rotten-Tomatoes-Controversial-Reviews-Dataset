Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Long time user of RT. First time making an account and I did it just for the sake of putting my perspective in. Ok\\, so even watching this without the expectations of a Star Wars fan and judging the film as a standalone sci-fi\\, it was pretty dire. Little to no character development\\, bad acting\\, hammy script\\, loaded with cheese. The plot development was severely lacking\\, it jumped all over the place. The score was flat and failed to create a sense of atmosphere\\, build tension or add to any excitement and both the directing\/editing were mediocre at best. It felt empty and the standout moments failed to make up for the overall blandness and lack of cohesion throughout. The action scenes and effects were excellent\\, the creature design also stood out as a silver lining along with the set design\/choice. but all in all\\, seriously unimpressive piece of film-making. That's all without putting it into the context of the trilogy\/star wars franchise. How this has such excellent reviews across the board mystifies me. I need to watch it a few more times to make sure I'm not losing my mind...","true":true}
