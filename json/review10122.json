Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great movie... but as a Star Wars movie....  Over all I loved it. It worked for me on so many levels but I  think they have a big job on their hands going forward.\\nI would give it 5 stars as a movie and 2 as a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
