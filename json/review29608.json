Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson's brash and bold attempt to take the new movies into a new and uncharted territory. It's a shame that the lore and mythos of the world of Star Wars were jettisoned somewhere along the way together with the unshakeable integrity of one of the key characters from the old trilogy. The humour falls flat\\, and an entire sequence on one of the new worlds is very reminiscent of the things we all hated in the prequels. Certain plot points that were setup by JJ in the previous movie are completely done away with in a very casual manner. Very disappointing.","true":true}
