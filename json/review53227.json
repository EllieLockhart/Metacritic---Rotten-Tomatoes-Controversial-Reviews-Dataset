Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bold\\, exciting\\, heart felt\\, revealing... absolutely loved this movie.\\n\\nNo\\, just because you didn't like the movie doesn't mean the critics were paid by mickey mouse. The Force Awakens was a very safe film. The Last Jedi has massive balls and takes many risks. You will either love it or hate it. It's unfortunate if you are the latter. It truly is. Because this is everything I felt when watching the original Star Wars as a kid; not copying anything else\\, but breaking new ground.","true":true}
