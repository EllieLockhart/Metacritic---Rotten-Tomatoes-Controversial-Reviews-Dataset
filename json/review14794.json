Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i have the same reaction to this movie as Luke had to Rey handing him his lightsaber. There are so many storylines going on and it's hard to get emotionally invested in any of them. The tension between Rey\\, Luke\\, and Kylo was great but it seems that for every good moment there are five terrible moments to go along with it. Snoke is a joke. We still don't really know why Rey is so powerful with the force. The Finn and Rose storyline could've been cut completely. I honestly have no desire to see where these characters end up in Episode 9.","true":true}
