Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have to be honest and state that I used to trust reviews by rotten tomatoes but never again .\\nThis was a totally incomprehensible movie which could have been covered in a 45 minute time span instead of the 2 1\/2 hrs it runs.\\nBloody awful doesn't even begin to describe this film.....The plot is weak the storyline is non existent the characters are under used and it's almost like a box full of fan suggestions that never actually gel to form an actual storyline.\\nThe only Force you will encounter is the will to stay awake through an utterly boring movie.","true":true}
