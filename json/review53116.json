Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Best Star Wars film made as of yet. Everything about this movie was incredible\\, aside from minor issues. Every performance\\, the multiple extremely engaging plot points and insanely awesome character arcs and bonds\\, the ridiculously amazing fight scenes and chase scenes with the most stunning CGI\\, the humour and general Star Wars banter between characters and the creatures within the galaxy\\, the as-ever intense battle between the First Order and the rebels. The only thing which I think they could've handled better was the way they scripted Finn\\, as I was kind of disappointed at the way his storyline ended. 100% go and see this film\\, regardless of whether you know what Star Wars is or not. I shed a tear.","true":true}
