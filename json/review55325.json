Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like this a lot. It has it's issues\\, it's rather long and the climax could be longer perhaps in terms of the final confrontation but other than that. There's some great performances from Hamill\\, Driver\\, Ridley especially\\, there's plenty of the exciting action we love\\, it's pretty intense in terms of tone\\, far less light than The Force Awakens\\, yet it is surprisingly funny. The core story is quite emotional\\, deep and expands a lot of what we think about the force and how it works. There's a lot of controversy about Luke in this film\\, but I found where they took the character quite compelling in terms of how he's changed over the years\\, there are some amazingly unexpected twists too that completely change the game. It improves on things from TFA (especially Kylo's portrayal) in many ways but TFA is a bit more singularly focussed whereas this is very multi strand. As a lifelong SW fan\\, I enjoyed it a lot even with some minor flaws here and there. Looking forward to seeing what JJ does with the next one as without spoilers this leaves things in a very interesting place for the next one. The score is the usual John Williams mastery\\, the themes solidify a bit more this time and there's some beautiful reprises of older themes. Overall I'd give it a 4\/5\\, 8\/10 kind of mark. Not perfect but packed with intensity\\, emotion and fun and with a willingness to shake things up and change the game to take us in a new direction\\, something which The Force Awakens caught a lot of flack for not doing.","true":true}
