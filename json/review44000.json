Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Through sloppy pacing\\, rushed action\\, bad dialogue\\, and one of the most embarrassing moments in franchise history\\, there is enough of an engaging story\\, visual majesty\\, and nostalgia for Star Wars fans that makes it a barely passable experience.","true":true}
