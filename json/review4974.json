Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Could have so much better\\, Very carEless directing and writIng  ruined the experience. I Have tried twice to make it through a second view and failed boTh times due to boredom and frustration.","true":true}
