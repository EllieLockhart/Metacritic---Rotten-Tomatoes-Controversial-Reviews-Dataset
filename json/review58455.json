Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All over the place in its tone\\, changing it from dramatic to comedic to tense to even cynical without real consistency\\, the lack of an original plot and the inappropriate amount of stupid jokes make this movie a gigantic farse. After the first ten minutes you might think you ended in the wrong room\\, watching a rerun from some Mel Brooks or Leslie Nielsen parody. There is almost no real moment of drama or tension\\, since they keep cutting it with some very questionable \\\"funny\\\" moment or animal or situation. So much so that it becomes quickly impossible to take anything seriously at all. It is filled with cheesy one-liners and pseudo-witty jokes in the most inappropriate of moments. Oh\\, and yes\\, we discovered that Hoth is actually a salt planet\\, not an ice planet. So the whole opening scene in \\\"Empire strikes back\\\" makes no sense at all anymore.\\nThe only exception to this mess are the scenes in snokes room which are visually beautiful\\, reminding of \\\"Flash Gordon\\\" and keeping a serious tone throughout\\, but still it seems to watch a retake of \\\"Return of the Jedi\\\".\\nAll in all this might be the worst thing happened to Star Wars since the prequels\\, and maybe even worse. It takes a huge piss on everything Star Wars might have ever meant to anyone.","true":true}
