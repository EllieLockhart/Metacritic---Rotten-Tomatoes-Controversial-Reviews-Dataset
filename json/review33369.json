Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Tacked-on throw-away jokes that do not serve the story\\, but in fact\\, take away from it. Answers no questions other than how does Luke get his milk. Mary Poppins scene could have been done better. And now that hyperdrive is weaponized\\, it's going to make for some boring space battles in the sequels ;)","true":true}
