Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My least favorite Star Wars film\\, outside of the prequel trilogy. Flat. Many scenes seemed to lack meaning and purpose\\, other than providing something to happen rather than to create something awesome and meaningful. Mark Hamill saved the movie for me. I wanted to see more of Rey\\, and her development\\, discoveries\\, and actions... with meaning and purpose and powerful delivery. I like Daisy and think see was given a flat opportunity to shine. Outside of the prequels\\, this is the only Star Wars movie that I will not see in the theatre multiple times. Rian Johnson's writing of dialogue and his directing of the scenes felt so flat to me. Not impressed by his doing. There were no \\\"mystery boxes\\\" opened with his direction. Instead\\, expected scenes had emotionally flat \\\"twists\\\" that were predictable by need of plot and made each character's actions less interesting. For example\\, Finn's suicide mission was meaningless; obviously he wasn't going to die because it wouldn't allow for interesting plot line to follow. The scene was so flat that I didn't even care if I was wrong and he would have died at that point. Again no \\\"mystery box\\\" opened by Rian in that scene. I cared for the characters with the direction and dialogue in episodes IV\\, V\\, VI\\, VII\\, and even Rogue One. With Rian's direction and dialogue\\, I just didn't care for any of the characters\\, including those I've loved for roughly 40 years: Luke\\, Leia\\, Chewbacca\\, C3-PO\\, R2-D2\\, and Yoda; and including those I've loved for a couple years: Rey\\, BB-8. I liked and cared for Finn and Kylo too\\, but no more. Rian made them all boring to me\\, with the exception of Luke. Hamill acted his way out of the paper bag that Rian created with success. And as good as the other actors are\\, they all had to play in a flatline movie. BORING!","true":true}
