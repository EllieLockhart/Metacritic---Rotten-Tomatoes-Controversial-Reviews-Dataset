Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is an emotionally complex\\, beautifully crafted addition to the Star Wars saga. The performances are uniformly excellent\\, with Mark Hamil and Carrie Fisher putting in their best performances in the series. The script is incredibly written and provides so many unexpected twists and turns that made my jaw drop (it\u2019s quite funny too). The action is furious and exhilarating and the world of Star Wars has never looked better. All in all\\, it is truly terrific! ","true":true}
