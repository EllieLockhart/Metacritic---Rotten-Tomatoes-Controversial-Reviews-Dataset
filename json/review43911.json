Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Though the beginning plays as a bit unfocused an hammy\\, The Last Jedi gets progressively stronger as it goes on and has an interestingly different take on Star Wars. The franchise seems to be moving beyond a simple good vs evil divide between light and dark and I think this is ultimately a good thing. TLJ also deliberately subverts expectations of payoffs to frankly not very interesting and tired mysteries of parentage and cannonical origins in a clear turn away from the more derivitive trilogy Abrams appeared to be setting up. I can see why the blurred distinction between good and evil and turn away from trope reveals would make some fans uncomfortable\\, however\\, but Star Wars needs to grow up a bit to survive and I think this is the right move.","true":true}
