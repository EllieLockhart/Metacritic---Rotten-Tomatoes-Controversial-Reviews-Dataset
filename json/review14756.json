{"101487":133900,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I haven't been this disappointed in a Star Wars film since 1999. This isn't just a bad Star Wars movie\\, it's a bad movie in general. I would say Last Jedi is comparable in writing and directing to Suicide Squad. Everything felt forced\\, the dialog only served to blatantly explain the plot (just like in Suicide Squad)\\, the story was piecemealed together by characters introduced briefly only for the sake of driving the plot\\, there was obvious overarching social agendas being pushed constantly\\, the cast seemed as though they gave up on the script 2 minutes in\\, poor casting of newly introduced characters\\, almost everything was CG\\, the animations were on par with LOTR (2004)\\, and the lighting gave a campy\/comedy feel the entire movie (think Rob Schneider). They might as well have given the Star Wars franchise back to George Lucas. It was 3 hours of cringe worthy cinema where I was constantly rubbing my temples waiting for each predictable\\, poorly written scene to end. The best way I can describe this movie is Suicide Squad meets Avatar made for TV movie. Unlike Blade Runner 2049 where 3 hours felt like 20 minutes and I never wanted it to end\\, I found myself checking the time 30 minutes in then checking the time every 15 minutes for another 2 and a half hours waiting for it to end. It felt like I was being tortured A Clockwork Orange style by my favorite movie franchise. I kept thinking about that South Park Episode where George Lucus and Steven Spielberg are sexually assaulting a Storm Trooper and Indiana Jones (except Crystal Skull was a better movie\\, which is truly pathetic and sad). Rian Johnson should be ashamed of himself for producing such a shoddy piece of disappointment.","true":true}
