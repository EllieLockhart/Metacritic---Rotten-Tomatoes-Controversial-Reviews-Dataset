Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unbelievably disappointing overall. Whether you're a lifelong Star Wars fan\\, or new to this story\\, this was not a worthy installment. The pace is grossly flawed\\, the plot is not compelling\\, it diminishes almost all the mystery and intrigue setup in Episode 7\\, and it's too long. A good 30 mins could have been trimmed from this film. There was an overwhelming amount of out-of-place comic relief\\, and not enough tension to compensate. Worst of all it does a massive disservice to many of the characters in previous films.","true":true}
