Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hated this when I first saw it on the big screen. I rewatched it recently and couldn't believe how much stuff I missed searching for the nostalgia TFA gave me. It's actually a really solid movie and I really enjoyed the second watch.","true":true}
