We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game should be one of the best games of the PS4\u2019s lifetime to ever release\\, unfortunately\\, it\u2019s left me with lingering bitter taste for me to ponder on. While at many moments I will admit I do feel immersed into the game and I feel the character\u2019s\u2014 be it Ellie or Abby\u2014 emotions and understand their convictions. This game tried and failed to compare the two characters of Joel\\, and strangely\\, Abby. Her relationship with the scars child Lev mimics that of the relationship and travels done in the first game as Joel and Ellie. Abby kills anyone in her way to take care of Lev and Yara\\, even in the end betraying her own people. At times you can almost see a semblance of remorse that she may feel\\, like when invading the scars\u2019 island\\, but it is executed in an utterly terrible way. Abby even mimics Joel in the way her character plays gameplay wise\\, having a similar move set using her bare hands to pummel zombies\\, and being more stiff and rigid than Ellie\\, to even the return of shivs in gameplay albeit with a new slight twist. I very much so want to like this game which is why it leaves me with such a bitter conflicted feeling in the end as it simply doesn\u2019t live up to the first entry in any meaningful way except for the improvements to the engine\\, graphics\\, and gameplay\\, although too little in terms of change in my opinion. I\u2019d give this game a 3\/10 simply because of the graphics\\, the fighting animations\\, and set pieces. It\u2019s that golden pile of crap from American Dad\\, looks beautiful sure\\, but it\u2019s still a pile of **** at the end of the day.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
