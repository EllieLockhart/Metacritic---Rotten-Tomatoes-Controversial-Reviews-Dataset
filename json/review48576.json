Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worse Star Wars movie ever\\, hell just a terrible movie take the Star Wars titles off and you have two hours of crap. The goal most have been to sell more stuffed toys and cute little critter items because the movie had no flow\\, was in no way original and all around just losses me off. Luke\u2019s character was destroyed \\, went from one of my favorite to a self pity little birch. God this movie sucked. Star Wars has such a great premise it\u2019s amazing how they keep screwing it up.","true":true}
