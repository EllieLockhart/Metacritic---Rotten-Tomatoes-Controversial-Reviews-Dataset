We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"On the technical site the game really shines\\, everything looks amazing\\, the acting\\, the emotions\\, voiceacting everything is brilliant. 10\/10 for me. I got to say it kinda felt like Uncharted 4 with TLoU skin\\, gameplay wise\\, which in my opinion is not a bad thing as I loved Uncharted 4.\r\rStorywise and this is only my personal opinion and I'm happy for everyone who got what they wanted out of the game and the story. We knew the second game will be really dark and I looked forward to this.\r\rWe even knew that Joel would probably not make it and that he would go out one way or the other.. For me personally Joel was my character\\, I really loved him in the first game and while he may not always made the right decisions\\, I as a player could still stand behind him because we knew why he did what he did. In the second part we now get to see that some decisions have really harsh consequences.\r\rI generally like revenge plots in games and in movies but I really did not like the way they tried to play it out in this game. Maybe if we would have gotten more time with Joel & Ellie together\\, how they developed in the years we haven't seen them and then get to know Abby\\, her struggles\\, her story of revenge etc. before she gets her chance to complete her revenge it would have resonated better with me.\r\rPlaying as Abby after she killed Joel made it hard for me to continue and the end didn't do it for me. I think with a better order of events the same game could have been much more enjoyable. I really tried to feel bad for Abby but in the end she was still the one who killed the character I cared the most about. The story had great moments and I don't want to spoil to much but I think this game is still worth a playthrough. Maybe with knowing what I know now I wouldn't pay full release price but it is what it is.\r\rEnding the game left me feeling empty and unsatisfied\\, maybe that is what they wanted to archive but honestly I'm not looking forward for a third part.\r\rI would love to give this game a 10\/10 but I just can't. I love ND and I see where they wanted to go with this but it just isn't for me\\, and that is Ok. I think for anyone that is not as invested with Joels Character as I am the game will be amazing. That's why I give it a 6\/10 but remember for you this game could be a 10\/10 so play it\\, in the end it's just a game and it is not on us to decide which directions the creators want to go.\r\rOn a side note\\, I really have to disagree with people saying that they pushed some kind of agenda in this game. It didn't feel forced and I think it fits the way the game is designed. Sex scenes are normal in 18+ series\/movies and shows a side that is often dismissed in storydriven games.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
