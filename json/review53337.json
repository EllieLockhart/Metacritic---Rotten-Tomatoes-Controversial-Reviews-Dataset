Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dec 15\\, 2017\\nCan't believe some of the comments on here. Clearly\\, people are just angry their fan theories didn't come true. This film makes Star Wars fresh while providing an homage to what came before\\, as far back as the prequels. I really couldn't ask for much more\\, and I'll be damned if these bitter fanboys slander this film without response.","true":true}
