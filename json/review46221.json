{"101487":193237,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"WARNING\\, some spoilers! First off\\, for those complaining about the reveal that anyone can be a Jedi have really missed the entire structure of the Jedi themselves. Are Obi Wan and the Skywalkers the only Jedi throughout? Absolutely not\\, so why does Rey have to be connected to either? Why was the force so strong in Anakin from a young age? Well now we know and I am pleased that the story is branching from the Skywalker clan. Don't get me wrong\\, Luke and Vader were my favorite characters from the original\\, but it is time to develop this story further\\, which is exactly what Rian does. \\n\\nIt feels like those bashing the film are taking themselves to seriously. Sorry that your theories did not play out\\, and you should be happy about this\\, not angry (as it seems most reviewers here are). Sorry that Poe and Finn have relatively pointless plots in this story\\, but this was never going to be about Poe or Finn. This story line was always going to be about Rey and Kylo-Ren\\, which is why Luke was barely in the first one and why Han was killed. The casino scene was not good\\, especially when the drunk guy starts dispensing coins into BB-8 as if it is a slot machine. Then for BB-8 to use those coins as a weapon is cringe worthy. Other than the scenes at Canto Bight\\, the film was exciting and full of twists. Reviewers here seem to also harp on the plot line for Luke Skywalker\\, because it wasn't what they wanted or expected. Again\\, you are taking yourself to seriously. Get over the fact that this film is now run by Disney. Rian did a great job creating something new out of a 40 year old story. This film deserves the recognition it will get\\, as it will change the entire outcome of the story\\, just like Empire did.Those stating the movie was 15 minutes too long are probably right\\, but who cares\\, that's 15 more minutes of Star Wars we get to watch. As a die hard fan\\, I will be there again opening night for Episode 9.","true":true}
