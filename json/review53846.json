Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hey everyone\\, guess what?  Disney's managed to destroy Star Wars!\\nWhat's almost more disturbing is the realization that RT is just a place where Shitty movies get great reviews from \\\"critics\\\" who are more interested in praising leftist BS (in this case\\, strong\\, smart women vs. weak bumbling men) so prevalent in entertainment than admitting that for all intents and purposes\\, Hollywood Cinema is DEAD DEAD DEAD!\\nThanks Mickey!\\nGood offing riddance!","true":true}
