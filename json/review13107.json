Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don\u0092t know what these people giving negative review are talking about. If you like Star Wars and aren\u0092t going to nerd out over too much stuff that most people won\u0092t even understand then go see this movie! You will love it!! For real.","true":true}
