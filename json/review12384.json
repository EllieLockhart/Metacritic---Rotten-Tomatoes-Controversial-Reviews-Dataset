Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I believe I can show that the current audience score of 49% which RT displays for the Last Jedi is false.  I can only speculate as to why they are lying but they clearly are.  I did a statistical analysis of all of the audience reviews I was allowed to view.  There are nearly 2000 pages of reviews and I was able to access 46 of them.   This is a perfectly reasonable sample size which I believe represents an accurate reflection of the overall audience opinion.  A five star rating system translated to a scale of 1 to 100 means that each star is worth 20 points.  A half star is 10 points etc.   Here are my results...\\n\\n.5 stars - 339\\n1  star -  173\\n1.5 stars - 66\\n2 stars - 90\\n2.5 stars - 23\\n3 stars - 19\\n3.5 stars- 12\\n4 stars - 26\\n4.5 stars 25\\n5 stars 95\\n\\nA sample size of 868 audience reviewers awarded a total of 23390 points for an average user score of 33.8594.  Less than 34%.  \\n\\nI don't know why RT is lying to the public\\,  but they are clearly preventing the audience score from falling below a certain level.  If RT is protecting Disney's interests then this is a conflict of interest of the highest order and this site cannot be trusted.  Again\\,  the true audience score for this film is well\\, WELL below 40.  Avoid this movie.  Cherish the OT and ignore these cash grab rip offs.","true":true}
