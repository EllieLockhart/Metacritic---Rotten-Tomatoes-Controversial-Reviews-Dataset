Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Entertaining all around. I\\,m sure that Starwars geeks are torn and disappointed about the twists in the plots that conflicted with their own fantasies but overall the movie was satisfying.\\nSure we all have our own thoughts about what could have happened to Luke\\, Rey's training and  Carry Fishers's space walk\\, but the star wars universe is moving into a new a fresh direction. Curious  to see where the next flick will take us.","true":true}
