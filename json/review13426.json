Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed the visuals\\, scenes\\, most of the acting\\, and action.  I am not sure where i would rank it in star wars films but it would be near the bottom.  Ive never watched a star wars film before with so many plot holes.  Expect the direction from 7 to be completely demolished.  Want to know morr about snoke\\, knights of rhen\\, or Rey?  Expect to be very disapointed.  They direction\\, humor\\, and plot made it seem not even real.  You felt with all the others that iy wasnt a movie u were watching except for some of the 1-3 films.","true":true}
