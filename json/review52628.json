Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All I have to say actors and actresses are great but I can see why Daisy Ridley doesn't want to do Star Wars anymore after contractual obligation and Why Mark Hamil said at Star Wars con before he was interrupted by Kathleen Kennedy that The Last Jedi Luke Skywalker isn't even involved\\, and Also why Mark Hamil is fundamentally against everything Rian Johnson did to his character\\, Mark I should have listened when you tried to warn us instead I wasted my money.","true":true}
