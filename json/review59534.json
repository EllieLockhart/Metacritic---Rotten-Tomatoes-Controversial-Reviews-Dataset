Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I came into this game know full well the controversy following it\\, what with the leaks and all. I was always going to play this game regardless of reviews\\, cause normally I don't pay them much attention. Alas\\, here we are and I'm leaving a review.... oh how the mighty have fallen...ANYWAYS lets get into the game. coming off of what was maybe Naughty Dog's most successful endeavor (aside from uncharted I guess).\r\rI came into TLOU2 with high hopes that were deflated partially due to what I found out in the leaks however\\, I wasn't going to let that stop me from still experiencing it first hand. If I was going to be disappointed I wanted to be absolutely sure. As I played thru the first few hours I enjoyed the gameplay\\, the graphics\\, the beautiful scenery\\, hell I even enjoyed picking up the collectible cards that had super heroes on them. The accessibility options for the game are top notch. But this damn story!!?!? just all over the place. Ellie is demonized while were forced to try and empathize with Abby\\, who is no saint whatsoever by the way. actually her arc is already finished within the first few hours of the game! she gets exactly what she wants in a most convenient fashion. and just when you think you get to exact your revenge.... We are treated to 12+ more hours of why we should all respect this other character and demonize Ellie for......well for essentially killing a dog\\, in which we had no choice cause it was literally self defense\\, and well... there wasn't any other choice. skipping to the ending where as I played I felt like I had about 3 false endings... Ellie still cant cope and HAS to exact revenge...........but nahhhhhhhhh. just as you feel like\\, here it comes\\, here is the revenge literally EVERYONE is waiting for.......flop\\, she allows Abby to sail off into the mist while she gets to return to NOTHING! (and a few less fingers). and thats it. she cant even play her guitar anymore so she just leaves it and walks off to hell who knows after that butchered story most likely walk herself into a room full of clickers......Garbage Storytelling!\r\rand no... i'm not a close minded bigot of any sort. My problems don't have anything to do with the inclusion of LGBTQ characters. it's the **** job they did trying to justify half of the characters who were just as bad if not worse than Joel\\, Ellie\\, or Tommy. they spent so much time trying to make Abby likable and at no point does that ever resonate. i found myself wanting to know more of the seraphites and the prophet more than anyone else in the game. yet their abandoned and just labeled as crazy bigots.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
