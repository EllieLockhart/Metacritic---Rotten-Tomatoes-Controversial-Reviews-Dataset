Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ah! I also just created an account so I can bring this thing down where it belongs. It is\\, by far\\, the worst Star Wars movie. This makes the prequels look awesomely remarkable. Not only is The Last Jedi not a decent movie on it's own\\, it disregards everything that gave Star Wars its foundation. Say goodbye to the old and the past. A noble endeavour but there's little point in replacing something complete and potent with garbage. The story is riddled with plot holes\\, continuity errors and disgusting attempts at creating something better than what was. They grabbed one of the most beloved lore of my generation and turned it into Transformers. Yup\\, it's that bad. Good job Disney\\, you made your buck. Time to say goodbye. My sons will grow up far far away from this inarticulate mind-numbing nonsense.","true":true}
