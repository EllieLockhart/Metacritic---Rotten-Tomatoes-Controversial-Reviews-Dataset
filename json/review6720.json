Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don\u2019t know why audiences are so hard on this movie. True it had a few moments where the director tried to hard to be cute\/funny but come on! It\u2019s a space cowboy matinee not an art house piece. Four solid stars for me! ","true":true}
