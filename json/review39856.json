Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a terrible movie that uses the one of the most iconic characters in Star Wars and uses him to trash everything Jedi and the original trilogy. I don't know what they were thinking. I actually really liked the Force Awakens and was hyped to see this movie. Man did they get it wrong.","true":true}
