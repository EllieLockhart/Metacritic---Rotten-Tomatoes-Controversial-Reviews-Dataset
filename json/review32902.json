Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Stephen Colbert is an old man with senile dementia. I'm not surprised he really believes that the fan backlash essentially comes from white overweight bald impotent women-haters. The truth is that this movie sucks donkey's ass big time. Disney is reaching new levels of lameness every day and their desperation is becoming evident.\\nTheir last weapon of mass distraction (in order to avoid admitting Solo's failure) is the fake Kelly Marie Tran's drama on Twitter. You really think we are stupid\\, don't you\\, Disney? \\n\\nI read a lot of comments every day and a very few attacked the poor actress. The vast majority of the comments (say 99%) are about the futility\\, superficiality and lameness of Rose Tico character. And EVERY SINGLE COMMENT points out that it is Rian Johnson's fault.","true":true}
