Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When watching this film\\, think of Luke standing in front of the burnt dead carcasses of his aunt and uncle\\, no massive angst just \\\"I want to learn to be a jedi\\\". Think Hoth and a lot of deaths\\, think cloud city and the screams of torture of han solo.  \\nThis is Disney star wars for angst ridden teeny boppers being fed on hunger games","true":true}
