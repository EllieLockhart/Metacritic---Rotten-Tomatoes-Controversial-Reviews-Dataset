Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No spoilers\\, but huge plot holes\\, bad writing\\, and nothing made sense in a story sense or in a reality sense. People who seemed to like it the most were casual fans and new fans. I believe this was made purely for children. All of the questions I wanted answered from previous movies were either ignored or glossed over. Some will disagree\\, and to each their own. I love the original trilogy\\, didn't care for the prequels\\,  liked Force Awakens but HATED this.","true":true}
