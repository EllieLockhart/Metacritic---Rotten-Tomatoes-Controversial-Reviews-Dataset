Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So bad. Zero interesting moments. Felt small and contrived. It's not true that his is 4Chann piling on\\, or hard core fans dissappointed because their ideas weren't on display. I'm a moderate Star Wars fan\\,went with my daughter expecting a  fun afternoon out\\, and got nostaglic with the rolling titles at the beginning... and then just waited for the movie to get good. It never did.","true":true}
