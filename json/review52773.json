Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Almost pure crap\\, the critic consencus vs crowd rating shows exactly how \\\"biast\\\"(and fonded) the promotion for this new franchise is. \\nProblematic rythem\\, poor casting and acting (except ray and luke acters\\, no depth to ficticious character on screen as usual and actually manages to recycle some of the just seen sequences of the previous movie *SPOILERS AHEAD* (asian dual sacrifice) and of course the new pelpetin digital cesar giving the young sith a push of \\\"faith\\\" instead of doing things which he surely capeable of doing on his own.\\nNice few gestures to the earlier trilogy and the last preety shallow battle seen on the salt field gave it a bit of an artificial boos (giving that visual art being  the main thing in the previous) \\, but simply too long for doing nothing worth going again\\, except for cashing back the income from a way overrated hype!","true":true}
