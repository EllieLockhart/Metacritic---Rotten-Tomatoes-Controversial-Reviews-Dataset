Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like many others\\, I was beyond thrilled to watch this movie. But like MANY others\\, was truly saddened and disappointing. I was truly invested in these new characters\\, and all of their stories fell so flat. What is there to hope for in IX? A lifelong SW fan who has loved every other SW movie in its own way\\, now crushed by TLJ. Didn't even watch the Solo movie. Please\\, please fix SW\\, Disney.","true":true}
