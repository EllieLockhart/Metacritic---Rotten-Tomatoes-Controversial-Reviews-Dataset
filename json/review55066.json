Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've seen The Last Jedi a few times now and so I can say this without reservation that Rian Johnson does not know as much about Star Wars as he thinks he knows. The only thing I will consciously give this movie credit for are the visual effects\\, creatures\\, cinematography\\, locations\\, practical effects\\, and CGI. However\\, the core of the film - plot and character development\\, was absolutely abysmal. I'm all for taking chances but there were plot holes everywhere. There doesn't seem to be a master storyline to this trilogy and I really feel that perhaps a little direction pointing should have been considered by the saga's creator. Star Wars\\, now under the blanket of Disney has been ruined by it's 'Marvelfication' and formulaic storytelling. The humor was unsettling and not keeping with the tone of the rest of the series. I felt I was watching Thor - Ragnarock all over again. There were some great moments in this movie\\, but they were just that - moments.","true":true}
