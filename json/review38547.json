Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst star wars movie ever and I've seen the xmas specials.\\n\\nWhat ever disney's plan for star wars was but they have failed. love how the paid reviews rate the movie at 91% but the Audience rating is at 46% the says it all Disney are in full damage control after the flop that was SOLO.\\n\\nThe general critic consensus says Star Wars: The Last Jedi honors the saga's rich legacy while adding some surprising twists -- and delivering all the emotion-rich action fans could hope for.    This left me speechless","true":true}
