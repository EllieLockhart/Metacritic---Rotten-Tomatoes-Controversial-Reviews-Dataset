{"101487":138168,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-31","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Innumerable layers of stupid slathered over a heaping pile of dumb!\\n\\nRepost: it's been a month\\, and I am still nauseated from this vomitous mass of a movie.  The writing and directing is so derelict as to draw reflection in my mind with two other movies of similar ilk 1) the Last Air-Bender 2) Eragon.  All three movies present some of the worst debauchery toward the legacy and source material on which they drew.  In this respect\\, TLJ is the worst offender of the three.  Unlike the others\\, Disney won't have enough self-awareness to stop.\\n\\nBelow is my review\\, free of swear words (unlike this last installment of TLJ--a first for Star Wars).\\n\\nWhen looking for a rotten tomato suitably foul enough to throw at this work\\, a quote from a very quotable movie comes to mind (note\\, nothing was quotable from TLJ).  Remember the Booer from Princess Bride\\, the one from Buttercup's dream?  Seems appropriately directed to Disney and its TLJ writers\\, director\\, and management in this case.  Please permit a touch of literary license to make the parallel.\\n\\n\\\"She (Disney) had the crown jewel of pop culture in her hands\\, and she treated it like garbage.  And that's what she is\\, the Queen of Refuse.  So bow down to her if you want\\, bow to her.  Bow to the Queen of Slime\\, the Queen of Filth\\, the Queen of Putrescence.  Boo.  Boo.  Rubbish.  Filth.  Slime.  Muck.  Boo.  Boo!  BOO!\\\"\\n\\nYeah\\, this quote is starting to touch on the audience feeling about this movie\\, far truer than this falsely propped up audience score from RT.  No amount of Disney employed phony reviewers are going to keep this Titanic of a disaster afloat.with their over inflated reviews.\\n\\nUnlike Buttercup\\, no one who saw this movie is going to wake up from the nightmare spun by the writers and director of this dismal effort.  Boo! (as I throw my rotten tomato on the mountain already thrown in the past four weeks).\\n\\nSpoilers to follow.\\n\\nLuke Skywalker\\, the man who stood in the throne room of perfect darkness\\, fought off utter despair and negativity\\, with the lure of evil power in his grasp\\, who could have saved his friends by a seduction to the dark side\\, and having just defeated the biggest darkest villain ever created in pop culture\\, throws his light saber aside\\, choosing light\\, and thus suffers torture by the emperor (saving his father in the act).  This Luke Skywalker sets the entire premise for these post-quels by momentarily succumbing to the dark side to strike down his nephew\\, the dear son of his beloved twin sister?  This is  Nonsense!  That is just an utterly dumb premise for a Star Wars trilogy.  Luke would have found the darkness early (would sense it without having to sneak into Kylo's room at night) and fought FOR Kylo with moral certainty like he did when saving his father.  Disney disgraced the whole Luke story line and Lucas' entire message.\\n\\nChewbaca roasts a semi-sapient creature (presume it was a porg)? What!?  He then is shamed by the porg's horror and heart wrenching protests\\, enough to set aside his dinner\\, and then they are all BFFs in the next scene as they pilot the Falcon?  As if these bird-like porge are saying\\, \\\"hey\\, yeah...\\, you killed dad\\, but at least you didn't eat him\\, so you are alright; let's hang!\\\".  Then Disney has these porg thrown around the cockpit as comic window dressing (literally).  Ugh\\, this is utter stupidity.  This is fouled (or fowled) on several levels.  Let's just BBQ an ewok next.\\n\\nWhen has anything in Star Wars' saga ever run out of fuel?  The only thing running out of gas is this dead Disney franchise. (stupid)\\n\\nLight speed auto pilot space junk could win every war; far more destructive than any other weapon\\, including the force. (stupid)\\n\\nWhy haven't they figured out the great benefits of autopilot yet in that civilization?  Every ship's captain went down with the ship.  Why?   Because they have no autopilot\\, or droids!  Wait\\, What?!  (stupid).\\n\\nLeia's space walk: hair hardly muffed from being blown out of the cockpit\\, unconscious\\, body not boiling or bloating in space\\, poised like some angel figure we have seen in Earth renaissance art.  Was this some homage to the departed Carrie Fisher?  Or perhaps some decrepit artful attempt akin to the fetal\/womb moment of the movie \\\"Gravity\\\" (Gravity pulled the illusion off nicely)?  Whatever that was\\, it will go down as one of the greatest movie \\\"groaners\\\" of all time  One of the worst scenes ever shown in film.  What a terrible treatment of the Leia legacy (and Ms. Fisher).\\n\\nFor everyone's talk of SJW agendas and seemingly this portrayal of women's power and the debasing of men....  Yet\\, it seems this showed just the opposite.  I have never seen a more perfect display of managerial decrepit judgement and incompetence as was shown by Leia and Ms Purple Hair.  Hard-nose posturing in positions of authority is the epitome of pure managerial incompetence.  Ironically\\, that is what was strewn all over the screen in this movie by the two female leaders.  This is what Disney writers offered?  Really?  Even Leia at the end of the movie says\\, \\\"what are you looking at me for...?  Follow him! (referring to Poe)\\\" Ugh!  This whole movie is just schizophrenic\\, and these audience reviews don't call out the obvious contradiction from this failed story line.  If the writer was trying to depict female power\\, this movie goes down as an abject failure on that point alone.\\n\\n(An Aside) When will the cultures of the world  recognize that it's the synergy between men and women bringing our unique powers together\\, across generations\\, that draw out the greatest force within the universe?  When will that appear in pop culture?  This movie could have made that message.. Instead it was vulgarly handled by people of puny\\, fettered minds.\\n\\nPerhaps in part we are all misjudging Rian Johnson.  This movie is his surprise parody of the past seven Star Wars (as farcical as Space Balls).  His teat milking\\, baby-like dribbling Luke Skywalker moment is actually his metaphor of Disney gluttonously milking this for all it's worth\\, fouling the audience and its beloved stories.  Instead of taking the reins with honorable hands\\, Rian hates this saga and its moral based material\\, the audience fawning of the past\\, and the rich legacy\\, and this is his private insult to everyone\\, including Disney.  Drawing a bit on this metaphor\\, in choosing Rian and his team\\, Disney slopped this one worse than the milk running off of Luke's beard.  What a stupid scene.\\n\\nThe entire rebellion fleet (thousands of people) was just annihilated; a dozen or so people make it out the back way on the Falcon.  About 2.5 hours of mayhem just finished.  And there is a scene of exuberance and joy\\, framed like a Merry Christmas Card (a-la Disney).  Any sensible portrayal would have these people laying numb and weeping on the floor of the space ship\\, all requiring decades of therapy for the PTSD they will certainly experience\\, clothes torn apart\\, smoke soiled\\, picking crystals\\, metal\\, bones\\, and porg from their broken bleeding bodies.  Instead\\, Disney frames it as the \\\"feel good\\\" moment of the year.  \\\"We have everything we need to rebuild right here.\\\"\\, Leia says.  This whole wrap up scene is so out of place.  Disney just violated the audience's feeling in the worst way...\\, yep Disney\\, do you feel you have everything you need to rebuild this dead franchise right here (smile everyone for the photo)?  Ugh!  The depth of stupidity here is inexpressible.\\n\\nThere are about 4 dozen Lucas Films\/Disney employees that should be fired for this dismal effort\\, starting with the writers and directors (JJ has been snake tongued on this work as well) and running up through the executive levels of the corporation.  To say this is sophomoric is too generous.  Akin to the earliest efforts at motion pictures\\, TLJ feels like \\\"The perils of Pauline\\\" with 20 minute snippets of disjointed themes which constantly place the protagonists in farcical life threatening peril.  Vaudeville's vulgar methods\\, frivolously toying with the audience's senses\\, are gems compared to this work.  The writers are employing devices akin to the emotions of grade school kids to  play falsely on the sentiments of the audience (Finn's sacrificial kamikaze flight into a cannon comes to mind\\, as does Leia's space walk\\, and every captain that goes down with the ship).  This Disney effort suggests their team possesses the  intellectual depth and emotional intelligence of a jelly fish.  They have taken the pop-culture crown jewel of the last 40 years and thrown in into the mud\\, trounced all over it\\, and then used the mud hole as their personal latrine.  If you wanted a Disney-dumpster-dive this might just be the movie for you.  For those of us who enjoyed the genius of Lucas (George\\, we are so sorry we ever criticized your earlier work)\\, you will hate this movie...it is most deserving of your ire.\\n\\nDisney\\, save us and yourselves another horrible installment.  Please give this back to Lucas (and pay him punitive damages for your mistreatment of his legacy) with the sincerest of apologies\\, begging forgiveness of him and the Star Wars fans for your mishandling.\\n\\nAlso\\, I have been following the audience reviews since I saw this movie on opening day.  It seems about 4 of 5 audience reviews are giving it 1\/2 to 1 star ratings. Only 1 in 5 give it 4 to 5 star ratings.  Yet the average is 49% on the tomato meter?  Seems like fuzzy math from the tomato meter.  Audiences hate this far more than the rating percentile reflects.  And it seems Disney employees are writing the positive reviews\\, probably in defense of their dismal effort.\\n\\nTo the graphic artists\\, well done!  I don't mind the actors' work; given the material they are given to work with\\, they should be given medals of honor.  To Mark Hamill\\, my condolences.  How ironic the only heritage character left alive in this dead franchise is played by an actress who has passed (RIP Carrie Fisher).\\n\\nAs the final credits rolled in our opening day viewing of this movie\\, no one was cheering.  The sadness we all felt at the close was palpable and had nothing to do with the story line.  We had witnessed a disrespectful\\, contemptuous 2.5 hour trashing of a cultural icon (it was a Disney cultural war with America).  If you want to truly defeat a nation\\, destroy its cultural icons\\, debase its cherished stories and folklore which give identify\\, pride\\, or unity to the people..  There certainly is a war of some kind going on here in this movie\\, and it has nothing to do with a galaxy far far away.\\n\\nThere is nothing in the current story lines that draws on my imagination or desire to see another Disney \\\"Star Wars\\\".  For movie art\\, this sincerest of heart felt repugnance (and utter indifference for what follows in this trilogy) is the most condemning statement of all.\\n\\nThis movie truly is innumerable layers of stupid slathered over a heaping pile of dumb.","true":true}
