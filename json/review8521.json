Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First and foremost I think it was completely disgraceful how they treated beloved characters that made the franchise what it is and has been. As for the new characters that were completely over pushed\\, I found they were distasteful and poorly written. I also believe everything that JJ Abrams planted in episode 7 was completely ruined and disrespected\\, leaving episode 9 with not much to look forward to. With all that aside\\, I thought the last jedi holds some of the most entertaining scenes in the franchise. To me the most gripping aspect of the movie was Kylo and Rey's connection and is the only thing I'm looking forward to in episode 9. In my opinion Reylo babies is the best and only thing I can hope for the future of star wars. ","true":true}
