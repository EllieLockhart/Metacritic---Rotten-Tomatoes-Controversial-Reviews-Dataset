Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Looks like the new guard (Disney) just did their best to STOMP OUT the old guard (George Lucas\\, y'know\\, the man who dreamed all of this up and changed the face of sci-fi\\, inspired millions\\, created a modern mythology).\\nThis film completely disrespects and dismantles all that was left of this modern myth.\\nVirtually all of the original characters are now wiped out...and the ones that are left were completely underutilized\\, unimportant...just placed around the movie like furniture that you don't need\\, but are not quite ready to part with yet.\\nI really\\, REALLY\\, liked the FORCE AWAKENS. I thought Abrams honored the Star Wars legacy with that film\\, mixing the old with the new\\, and producing a stunning\\, fresh installment to the series. I accepted and liked all of the new characters and actors\\, and really thought I would look forward to another 20 years of Star Wars\\, growing to love the new characters like the family that the old characters have been to me and so many.\\nThen along comes \\\"The Last Jedi\\,\\\" and basically pisses all over all that was sacred to this incredible modern myth of Lucas' design.\\nThe script and the directing were disgraceful. Character development that took 9 years to happen apiece in each of the first series (I-III\\,  IV-VI)\\, happens (or tries to happen) in 2 and a half hours. Too much\\, too soon. Terrible.\\nLuke Skywalker is revealed to be nothing special. After all of that hype. He's just a bummed out\\, burned out shell of a man\\, who turns his back on the Jedi\\, and never redeems himself. He's not remotely likeable in this film\\, or inspiring (and it's not Mark Hamill's fault-he was just acting the part written).\\nRae's development goes BACKWARDS...she is barely taught anything\\, then shows Master Jedi powers at the end of the film.\\nThe Sabre duels are conventional\\, and barely present (again\\, pissing on the old guard\\, what was most sacred). Rae and Kylo don't look like they know how to use them. \\nThis film was designed to \\\"clean out\\\" all of the old\\, and usher in the new Disney ideas.\\nDisgraceful. Disrespectful. Heartbreaking.\\nI can't believe I'm saying this...but for the firs time in my whole life\\, I don't care about the next Star Wars...I really don't. They killed it for me and for all true Star Wars fans.\\nI woke up the next morning hoping that I had not actually gone to see the film\\, that it was just a bad dream...then I saw my ticket stub on my dresser(!)\\nWhat a disappointment. Don't believe the hype\\, folks...how this movie is getting favorable reviews\\, I just don't understand.\\nReally\\, this film is\\, in one word\\, \\\"DISRESPECTFUL.\\\"\\nNothing is sacred anymore. I'll bet Lucas regrets selling it.\\nWhy buy it to COMPLETELY reinvent it? Terrible.","true":true}
