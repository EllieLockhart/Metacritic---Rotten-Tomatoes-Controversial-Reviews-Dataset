Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson decided to dismiss all the subplots The Force Awakens had set up (Luke's SOS map\\, Snoke\\, Rey's parents\\, etc.) and decided to make his own stand alone movie with far too many plot holes of its own. On top of that\\, he decided to forget the basic premise of the original Star Wars and has tarnished the legacy of the Jedi and Skywalker. People had been waiting 30+ years to see Luke Skywalker again but instead got to see Mark Hamill play a completely different character with the same name. I will say that the first half of the movie was pretty entertaining but the second half was farcical. The jokes were also pretty lame along with the development of the main characters. In my opinion\\, the character of Finn offers nothing and the subplot with him and Rose was absolutely pointless. Unfortunately\\, Adam Driver's character\\, Kylo Ren\\, is  probably the best of the bunch but even his character development has made him appear as more of a weak minded individual than a convincing villain. The overall writing\\, especially for Skywalker's character\\, was exceptional poor. Also\\, the idea that anyone can be a Jedi now was Disney's way of making Star Wars very politically correct which is a slap in the face to the fans of the originals. However\\, I think Disney's main reason for this was to make it easier for them to make countless more Star Wars movies that the general public will pay to see. I for one will not help them in their pursuit for $$$.","true":true}
