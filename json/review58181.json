Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yes\\, this was a beautiful movie.\\nbut I disliked so much about this movie when I left the theater I had nothing to talk about. Characters felt useless and had no development. I did not care when people died because I did not know them and lastly the comedy was misplaced at times it felt forced and took away from emotional moments.","true":true}
