Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unbelieable action\\, even for a Star Wars movies\\, annoying characters like Rose\\, Finn\\, and Admiral Holdo\\, the dresteuction of Luke's character and everything he stood for in the original trilogy\\, and major plot holes and continuity errors. Second to worst Star Wars after The Phantom Menace.","true":true}
