Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With so many unanswered questions left from TFA\\, I had high hopes going into this film. Unfortunately\\, I left disappointed. There are some good fight sequences and one spectacular lightsaber battle. Amazing new worlds\\, new technology\\, everything you would hope in a Star Wars movie. Those were the great things. Some characters were just tossed aside\\, a la Darth Maul. Some burning questions about other characters were given\\, just off the cuff\\, and lessened the emotional connection you had with them. A large part of the story line was inconsequential and felt like it was fabricated to give those characters something to do. The biggest issue was it didn't actually move the Rey\\, Fin\\, Poe\\, Resistance\\, First Order story forward. It quite literally just kept them treading water for 2 1\/2 hours. Han Solo was dearly missed\\, his humor\\, the camaraderie between he and Fin. That humor when applied using some of the other characters just didn't work. Right now\\, knowing how this movie ends and with the added problem that Carrie Fisher had passed away\\, I don't see any good way Abrams is going to move it forward to a conclusion and it not feel forced (no pun intended). Any day is a good day if there is a new Star Wars movie\\, but this one is not at the top of my list.","true":true}
