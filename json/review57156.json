Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is obviously a polarizing movie. Polarizing\\, flawed\\, but (personally) completely enjoyable.\\n\\nThe key to enjoying it is to realize that the characters from the original trilogy are firmly supporting cast. This is not their story anymore\\, they're still important\\, but the focus is where it needs to be- with Rey\\, Finn\\, Poe\\, and Kylo. It's no longer just the stories of the handful of people from the original trilogy or prequel trilogy\\, and the movie makes this point through the reveal of Reys parentage.\\n\\nIt fleshes out the aforemented characters\\, giving them personality that was sorely missing from VII.","true":true}
