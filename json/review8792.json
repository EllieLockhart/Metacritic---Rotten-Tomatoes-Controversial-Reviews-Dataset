Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For every bada** scene\\, there's almost an equal number of \\\"what the f*** were you thinking?\\\" moments. The big twist with one of the characters is a complete let down. They end tension with at a plot point that makes you think \\\"Shouldn't they have just done that at the beginning?\\\" I avoided all the trailers so I could go into the movie fresh and excited\\, and I left the theater feeling extremely disappointed and angry. If Guardians of the Galaxy type of humor is your cup of tea\\, then you are going to love this movie. It's everywhere -_-","true":true}
