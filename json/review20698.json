Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I waited till the audience rating was down to 49%. I had too much love to the OT to be the person who brought it there. \\nThe movie was terrible. What's worse is the tone deafness of Rian Johnson and his apparent inability to hear why so many hate this film. Worse than that is reading JJ Abrams praise this garbage. \\nThere is nothing bold here. Nothing ground shaking. Some kid just got into George Lucas' toy box and broke what he made.","true":true}
