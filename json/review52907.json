Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An absurd\\, misandrist wasted opportunity. \\n\\nThere is nothing 'original\\,\\\" Rian Johnson\\, about moronic humor\\, insipid dialogue\\, imbecilic plotting\\, and the outright mischaracterization\/assassination of established characters to suit a narrative purpose.\\n\\nIn his hubris\\, Johnson attempts to impose Hollywood's favorite cliche\\, the failed disillusioned antihero\\, upon a man characterized by optimism\\, goodness\\, respect for life\\, and a never-say-die attitude. Fans of the OT are justifiably enraged. \\n\\nAnd don't get me started on the attempted romantic pairing between a shirtless MASS MURDERER and the designated Jedi. This is unbelievably screwed-up messaging to be sending young women and young men.  \\nDo not turn Rey into Carmela Soprano\\, making excuses for EVIL. \\n\\nAnd a note to the misandrists at Lucasfilm -- It isn't necessary to devalue and marginalize men in order to elevate women.  Yet this film does so again and again quite transparently. Which is a big part of the reason TLJ's 'plot' is an incoherent\\, self-contradictory train wreck. \\n\\nThanks so much for killing my interest in Episode 9 and ruining my enjoyment of both Force Awakens and the OT. \\n\\nOn behalf of the wonderful men in my life I deeply resent what you've done in this film.  My family will not be giving Disney another dime as long as Kathleen Kennedy is running Lucasfilm.","true":true}
