Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I struggle to understand how a movie with so much history in its franchise and such a massive budget could end up so bland. Where is the excitement and intensity? Where is the background and character development? Why do the fight sequences not put me on the edge of my seat? After waiting years for this movie that was hyped to be one of the best ever\\, why have I not gone back to see it five more times? Is this really the best Disney can put forth for one of the biggest movie sagas in history?","true":true}
