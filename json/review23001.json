Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lots of plot holes if your a hard core fan.  Jokes were too many and not very funny for this type of film.  Luke is always 2 seconds away from crying\\, his entire story is patchy and thrown together.  Chewie is not used well at all....I could go on.  SJW politics seems to find it's way into this film too\\, and ruins the scenes it's in.  Just an average film.  Great CGI.  Thats it. Go for the explosions.","true":true}
