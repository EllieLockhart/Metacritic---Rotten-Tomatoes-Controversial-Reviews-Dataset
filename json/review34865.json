Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The fact that the movie is divisive is proof enough that the movie is bad. At least the majority agree that the prequels is bad with a few good moments. At least the majority thinks TFA is good but safe. This movie is playing by its own rules and not by its predecessors. Saying let go of the past but using the past as a crutch to sell this movie. The theme of the movie is about failure and the movie itself is a failure.","true":true}
