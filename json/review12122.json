Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a huge star wars fan and never felt the need to take the time to write a review but that has changed after my first viewing of the movie. The disconnect between the force awakens and the last Jedi is what makes this movie so bad. There are so many plot holes and so many missed opportunities to take this reboot in a new and exciting direction. There is such a disconnect between the two directors\\, that I question if anyone really watched the force awakens\\, and they range from large ones (who was snoke and why is he even in the story) to small ones ( why is Fin wearing the same jacket that seemed to get slashed in the force awakens). I gave this movie 2 stars because to a child these plot holes can go unnoticed. Wait until it's on Netflix.","true":true}
