Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Personally I think all fans could enjoy this film\\, however there are some over the top extreme and who just spent two years of their lives coming up with Theories\\, that by the time they saw the movie it couldn't live up to any of their outrageous expectations\\, as well this same fans are the ones who love the force awakens despite it just being a newer Episode 4 with some different characters and planets. Truly The last Jedi is what Force Awakens should have been\\, an opportunity for a new generation of characters\\, stories And fans.","true":true}
