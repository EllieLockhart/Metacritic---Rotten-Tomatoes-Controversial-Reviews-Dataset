Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"'Star Wars The Last Jedi' makes 'The Star Wars Holiday Special' look good.\\nIt's beyond clumsy. It is\\, I believe\\, wantonly dire. Woeful in almost every way it must have taken a conscious effort to be so bad. On the internet is forum after forum of the worst kind of juvenile fan fiction. Hordes of the barely literate spew their collective stream of derivative consciousness into an all you can eat buffet of trite 1D characters\\, boring plots\\, laughable dialogue and senseless action - dross by any standard; all of it is a more valid piece of art a more erudite and entertaining work than the open sewer that is 'The Last Jedi'.","true":true}
