Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Weakest Star Wars ever! Force Awakens was a weak unoriginal rehash and this was just simply weak. Why is the rebellion weaker than ever? Why is the New Republic gone by blowing up a single system when Star Wars universe is 100000s of thousands of systems? What is the New Order and how they take over? I hate these new episodes with a passion!\\,","true":true}
