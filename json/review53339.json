{"101487":114744,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-29","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Deciding not to follow up with many of the threads the Force Awakens played out\\, the Last Jedi leaves many questions on the table. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi's faults come from the fact that it is trying to tell two stories. One story is about Luke\\, Kylo Ren\\, and Rey. This is a fine story with a beginning\\, middle\\, and end. The other story deals with the rebels. It starts with them running away and ends... with them running away. Nothing is accomplished in this story line and that is what drags down the movie. Weighed down by lame jokes and terrible leadership\\, the \\\"rebellion\\\" (despite it not being a rebellion)\\, loses more of its forces to the First Order. The character of Rose and the Canto Bight mission were tedious and unneeded in the storyline outside of causing frustration. Finn's backstory of being an ex stormtrooper is pretty much forgotten and is now a comic relief type. Yeah\\, I want to learn about alien animal rights when watching Star Wars. A big blunder is Snoke's death. No explanation of how Snoke and the First Order came to be and why Luke did nothing to prevent Snoke from gaining power. And he dies just like the nobody he apparently is. Darth Sidious got 3 whole episodes to explain the downfall of the Republic. Snoke just does it off screen after episode VI. 0 respect to the lore and world building of the Star Wars Universe.","true":true}
