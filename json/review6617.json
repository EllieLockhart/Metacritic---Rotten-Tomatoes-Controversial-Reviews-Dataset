Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Do not listen to others\\, see the movie for yourself! It was ok the first time I saw it\\, but I went home and processed what i had seen. After watching it a second time\\, it is now in my top 3 Star Wars movies! Btw\\, yes I am a Star Wars fanatic!","true":true}
