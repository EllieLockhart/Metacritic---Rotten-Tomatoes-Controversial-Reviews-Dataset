Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dear Rian Johnson\\, please stop writing hundreds of 5-star reviews. We all know it's you. Kathleen Kennedy has already lost her throne at Lucasfilm and you will NEVER make the trilogy she promised you. All mankind (and womankind too) would not be able to survive another abomination like The Last Jedi.","true":true}
