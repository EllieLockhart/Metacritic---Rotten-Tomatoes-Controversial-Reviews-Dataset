Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie totally violates Star Wars history\\, is a terrible story that contradicts itself\\, and is basically a social justice warrior propaganda film. Perhaps the worst thing for Star Wars fans is shows Luke Skywalker as a would-be murderer who attempts to kill his nephew in his sleep. Another unbelievable part of the story is Rey is a Mary Sue super woman with no training who is so powerful in the force that she frightens Luke. The needless casino scenes added absolutely nothing to the story but politically correct propaganda. The only redeeming parts of the movie are the battle and lightsaber scenes. The best acting is done by Mark Hamill by far who turns in a stellar performance of what is a terrible story line. Adam Driver's performance is truly outstanding. He keeps you guessing about his true motives until the last moment. Daisy Ridley's performance is well done.","true":true}
