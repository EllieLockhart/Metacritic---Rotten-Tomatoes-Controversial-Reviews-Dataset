Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it! Getting away from the same old back story. Rian Johnson took a much needed sharp left turn. I absolutely love all the original characters. I would love to see them stay part of the story for a long time\\, but only if the story wasn't so predictable every time. It was always too comfortable. This shakes things up a bit! Johnson does a great job with yoda and the reunion of R2 and luke. Every scene with our Princess was phenomenal and touching. Can't wait for the next one!","true":true}
