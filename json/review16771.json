Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In my opinion this The Last Jedi fails on many different levels. Let me try to elaborate on this.\\n\\n1) IT FAILS AS A MOVIE IN GENERAL.\\nThe Last Jedi is fatally plagued by plot holes. Deus Ex Machinas\\, poor plot choices. The idea of the cat-and-mouse chase between the first order fleet and the rebels is not bad\\, but it is poorly executed. When watching the rebels slow escape I never felt a sense of impending danger and that caused a sense of detachment from the all situation. A similar plot device was used by  Battlestar Galactica (the rebooted season) in a much more convincing way\\, because there the show manages to convey the threat of the pursuers. Additionally\\, the whole Casino plotline feels out of place\\, detached from the story and eventually usesless because it does not add anything to the story. The only thing it achieves is to break the pace pf the chase.\\n\\nThe jokes throughout the movie also felt out of place and put there just for their own sake. Seriously\\, was it neccessary to have the scene with Kylo Ren withouth shirt just to make that silly joke? What's the point of it? \\n\\n2) IT FAILS AS THE SECOND MOVIE OF A TRILOGY\\nI didn't like the lack of originality of the Force Awakens\\, but that movie managed at least to create some interesting questions. Who are Rey's parents? Who is Snoke? In the Last Jedi the director Rian Johnson takes all these most interesting points and throws them out in the garbage. All the expectations that were built by TFA are just shuttered in TLJ. I feel like this has all been done on purpose by the director\\, who tried too hard to shock fans. Unfortunately\\, this is cannot work in a trilogy where you should build on the previous episode rather than making a tabula rasa at all costs. Another example of this is the story of Luke. The whole Force Awakens story revolted around the quest to find Luke Skywalker\\, because he was hinted to be (both by the rebellion and by the first Order) to be the one who will tilt the fate of the war. After one full movie looking for him\\,  the Last Jedi makes this whole search for Luke totally meaningless. Finding Luke Skywalker didn't advance the story in any way. He didn't leave his planet\\, basically he didn't train Ray (that cannot be called training)\\, he didn't pass any knowledge to the rebels\\, he didn't challenge the First Order in any way. If Luke Skywalker was removed from this movie the advancement of the story wouldn't have suffered at all\\, perhaps the movie would have even be better given the poor portrayal of its character. After watching the Last Jedi I couldn't help but asking myself why Snoke was so worried about Luke Skywalker. The Last Jedi simply took all the key questions and the main plot line of the Force Awakens (search for Luke) and destroyed them mercilessly.\\n\\n3) IT FAILS AS A STAR WARS STORY\\nWhen I went to watch the Last Jedi\\, I was not only expecting to get some answers for all the questions raised by the Force Awakens. I was also expecting to see rich Star Wars lore be respectfully honored. However\\, my feeling after the movie is that The Last Jedi has broken Star Wars beyond repair. The most damage was done to the character of Luke Skywalker\\, once an impulsive but kind person who would not give up even on the worst person\\, now a shell of a man who is willing to kill his nephew during his sleep. I also would have liked to see a display of his powers\\, but we never get that either. Not to mention that there is no lightsaber duel\\, yet another letdown. The fact that Rian Johnson killed Luke makes me think of a kid who would rather break a toy rather than leaving it to another kid (JJ Abrams) to play with.","true":true}
