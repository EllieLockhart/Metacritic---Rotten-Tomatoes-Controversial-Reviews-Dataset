Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A few aspects of the movie I enjoyed\\, but The Last Jedi is barely better than the least worst prequel. I viewed the movie twice and was bored through most of the second viewing. Plot holes galore\\, they still cannot get away from super lasers are gonna destroy everything as a plot\\, almost every character mystery set-up in The Force Awakens was discarded by Rian. Snoke is a joke\\, Phasma is a joke\\, Rose is boring\\, Finn is boring\\, Poe is a hyper-masc male that needs to be reigned in the nearly all-female leaders of the resistance\\, the porgs are props for anti-meat narratives\\, the Canto Bight sub-plot was a rant against capitalism and a PETA animal event\\, apparently space has gravity now\\, force ghosts can cast spells like Gandalf\\, just ugh\\, lazy writing. But\\, the nerds will love anything Star Wars and Disney will make billions so my words aren't going to hurt Disney's bank account.","true":true}
