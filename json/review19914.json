Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was enjoyable. Seeing Luke again - albeit not the Luke we remember - was worth the price of admission. Even in the reality of non-reality\\, there was too much unrealistic stuff in this movie. The humor was terribly misplaced as well.","true":true}
