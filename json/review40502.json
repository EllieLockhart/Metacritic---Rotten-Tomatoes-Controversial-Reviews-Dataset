Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the movie that killed the Star Wars franchise.  This gave the middle finger to all Star Wars fans with gigantic plot holes\\, terrible story telling\\, unfunny jokes\\, zero character development\\, inexplicable character actions\\, pointless side plots with political motivations and worst of all\\, they ruined the character of Luke Skywalker and then killed him off in a pointless death.  I should have demanded my money back.","true":true}
