Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Incredible character development. People that don't like it are just mad that Luke isn't a hero anymore. This was a more realistic and compelling portrayal of a hero's journey. Mentorship and failure are essential components as Yoda himself says. Also\\, everyone that's mad about plot holes\\, there's still a whole other movie left...chill. Also\\, 5 STARS FOR BEN SWOLO","true":true}
