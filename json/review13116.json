Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I dont know why critics are loving this movie\\, for me this has been the worst star wars experience I have ever had. characters under used we are no further forward from TFA. Rian johnson has answered all the big questions by dodging them\\, the finn storyline was not needed\\, the force storyline and skywalker legacy has been left in tatters. The CGI at the casino didnt look great but snoke did\\, it took me an hour after seeing the movie to process what i saw and all i could think was that was a terrible movie with some good moments and thats my final verdict if 9 doesnt fix star wars then I wont be watching them any longer.","true":true}
