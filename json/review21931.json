Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just saw The Last Jedi. I have to say that it was pretty disappointing\\, and really my least favorite of all the Star Wars movies. Overall it's a good movie\\, just not a good Star Wars movie. All of the cliffhangers from Episode VII are just tossed away - Rey's family\\, Snoke's identity. This movie is really an insult to prior storylines. Episode VII was just a remake of episode IV\\, but at least honored some of Lucas' vision. The Disney monopoly has just ruined Star Wars from here on and lost me as a fan.","true":true}
