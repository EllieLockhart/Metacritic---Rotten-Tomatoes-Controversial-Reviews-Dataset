Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A disgrace to Star Wars. Every choice made for Luke Skywalker was definitely done without thought. Annoying and Useless subplots. Clear that Star Wars is Disney's money cow\\, and the execs want milk.","true":true}
