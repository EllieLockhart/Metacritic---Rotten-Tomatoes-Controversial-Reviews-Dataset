Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a real boy not a Russian Bot ! This movie destroyed everything we love about Luke Skywalker! Rose Tico is ass! Canto Bight is ass! Broom boy can go fuck off! Kylo is still a bitch\\, no love for Chewie R2 and 3po\\, Rey well I just don't care about her \\, phasma wasted\\, hug more like who gives a fux. Saw this 5 times in theaters and bought the blu ray just to be sure it wasn't me! So many months later and not a day goes by where I don't think about how they destroyed our legacy characters for no reason\\,!
