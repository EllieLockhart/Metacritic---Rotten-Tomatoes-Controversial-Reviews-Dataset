Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie\\, while enjoyable on the surface\\, seems to be made by someone who cares very little about the universe it is made in. Plot points carelessly are thrown out\\, underwhelming (non-existent really) fight scenes\\, and most importantly some of the most iconic characters in cinema are given counter-character development and just generally disrespected.\\n\\nThank god for Rogue One and movies like it\\, because the main series has taken a terrible turn\\, and with only one movie left there is no spark to reignite the hope of fans.\\n\\nIf you love starwars\\, please only see this movie once it is out of theatres so as to not encourage this disaster of a movie.","true":true}
