{"101487":127405,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Heard that Rotten Tomatoes doesn't count 1\/2 star reviews towards the audience score\\, so I'm joining the bandwagon and changing my 1\/2 star review to a 1 star.  Still negative.\\n\\nThis movie made me angry.\\n\\nDisney's The Adventure of Rey and Friends 2: The Next Day was hands-down the worst Star Wars movie to date.  It has replaced the Star Wars Holiday Special as the movie that gets Star Wars wrong the most.  \\n\\nEverything about it felt cheap or out of place - Luke's character was all wrong\\, the humor was juvenile\\, plot points didn't make sense\\, new characters were shoehorned in...  Right off the bat\\, we have Poe's incredibly stupid Bugs Bunny routine\\, which sets the tone for how low the rest of the movie will stoop.  The First Order was intimidating and efficient in Episode VII\\, while collectively the First Order in VIII is Elmer Fudd.  Also\\, where are they getting the money to fund all these super weapons that are destroyed in about 7 minutes?  What the hell are these \\\"dreadnoughts\\\" now\\, and how much is my kid going to scream for one when we're in Toys R Us?  \\n\\nThe character of Rosie was unnecessary and boring\\, a flat-but-heavy piece of wood being carried around by the unnecessarily goofy Finn as they go through their unnecessary side plot to pad the run time.  Rian Johnson wrote Luke to be a complete coward\\, an incompetent crybaby who abandons his friends when they need him\\, which is the complete antithesis of the character that was built up in the original trilogy.  But of course Rey is\\, like\\, perfect.  She feels the dark side doing something\\, but this literally translates into nothing for her character or for the plot.  It just made for some ominous-sounding dialogue to disguise the fact that there was absolutely no tension or peril for her character.  \\n\\nLeia coming back to life was stupid\\, it was the absolute worst way they could have introduced us to her ability to use the force.  Not to mention\\, incredibly disrespectful\\, considering the actor ACTUALLY died between filming that and the film's release.  It was just cheap having her \\\"die\\,\\\" only to immediately bring her back.  Obliterates any emotional impact that scene could have had\\, and you'd think everybody over at Disney (\\\"a dead parent in every movie!\\\") who had to greenlight this would fully understand that.  Snoke gets punked out\\, which could have been alright if handled differently\\, but the way he died was a huge screw to the audience.  You can't tell the audience that character A is reading character B's mind at that very moment\\, and then have B surprise A.  No\\, you JUST established that character B is having their mind read!  Screw you too\\, screen writer!  That's just cheating.  \\n\\nSpeaking of screenwriter cheating\\, talk about a convenient ending!  \\\"We're stuck in a room with only one way in or out!  Well\\, ok\\, there is another way out after all\\, so... let's run away now!  Oh no\\, it's blocked!  Wait\\, no\\, now it''s not.\\\"  Kid grabs broom\\, the end.\\n\\nGarbage.  Just utter\\, complete\\, garbage\\, and the last of anything Star Wars I'll buy a ticket to see.  No\\, I will not being seeing it again to give it a second chance\\, I already wasted enough money on this abomination.  \\n\\nI wonder how many of these positive reviews are Disney shills out for damage control?  I can't imagine anybody who likes Star Wars OR cinema in general liking this.  I bet that would open Disney up to a class action lawsuit if it turned out they threatened and\/or paid off reviewers to give this movie a high rating.  Isn't that essentially fraud\\, to falsify reviews in order to get people to the theater and bilk them out of $200+ million dollars?  \\n\\nAlso\\, everybody throwing insults those of who didn't care for this movie\\, you're not changing anybody's minds.  You're only proving that this movie appeals to those with juvenile sensibilities\\, and I'm glad I won't have to run into the likes of you at the theater when IX comes out.","true":true}
