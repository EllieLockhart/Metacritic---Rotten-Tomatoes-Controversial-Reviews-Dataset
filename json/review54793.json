Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think I understand why Cinema Score is so much higher than reviews on this site. When I left the theater\\, I went away thinking\\, \\\"we'll\\, that was alright.\\\" I wasn't exhilarated like I had been for previous releases\\, but chalked that up to getting older and maybe a bit more jaded than I used to be. It was only after I was able to process what I had seen on screen that I began to question how much I really liked the movie. The more time went by\\, the more I realized I didn't like it at all. \\n\\nThe movie is visually spectacular\\, with some really fun to watch fights\\, both in space and between characters. But the story it's trying to tell is awful. It does nothing to advance the trilogy in any way\\, other than to decimate the ranks of the resistance. The movie stars with the resistance fleeing a planet\\, and ends with the resistance fleeing a planet. But even worse is what it does to the characters\\, both old and new. It absolutely ruined Luke Skywalker's legacy\\, gave Leia some ridiculous moments\\, and killed off so many of new characters you have to wonder where episode 9 can go from here. There are so many plot holes and continuity errors that you have to wonder how the story got green lit in the first place. It's obvious that Rian Johnson was in over his head\\, and we had to pay the price for it.","true":true}
