Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don\u2019t believe what you read. Middle of the road Star Wars film. This is a popcorn film! Nothing ground breaking\\, and not as bad as the prequel films. Subverts aspects of the original trilogy without really creating anything new\\, or expanding the Star Wars myth. Some great moments. Some cringe worthy moments. Positives: looks great. Sounds great. Great fight scenes. Great score. Negatives:Very boring middle act subplot. Poorly written new characters. Terrible humor. Terrible dialogue. Poor character arches. Tonal inconsistencies. Don\u2019t believe the reviews. Not a ground breaking film. Star Wars fanboys and fan girls will like anything with Star Wars slapped on it\\, or hate it? The reviews and Star Wars fans are polarizing and strange. Just another big loud diversion type film. Not awful\\, and far from great unless you only watch popcorn films for children. These films will never be as good as the originals. The originals are brilliant films. Cannot expect corporate films to replicate a genius like Lucas was in his prime! ","true":true}
