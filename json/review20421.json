Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I used to love Star Wars until this film. It actually ruins the mythology we have all loved. I find it interesting that Kathleen Kennedy would let someone who clearly hates Star Wars make a Star Wars film. This will be the first ever Star Wars move I do not see a second time. In fact it actually turns me away from the Franchise.","true":true}
