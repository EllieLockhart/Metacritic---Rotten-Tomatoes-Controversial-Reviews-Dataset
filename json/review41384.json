Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is an abomination. It is unworthy of the name Star Wars. If you love Star Wars you will hate this movie even Mark Hamill hates it. The Dark Side is strong with Disney.","true":true}
