Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There's a mixed feeling after I watched these movie. Maybe TLJ is not a bad movie just so-so... not good but not bad. But as a Star Wars movie? Nah this is not like a Star Wars movie\\, too many things that make me disappointed. The Last Jedy is BAD as a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
