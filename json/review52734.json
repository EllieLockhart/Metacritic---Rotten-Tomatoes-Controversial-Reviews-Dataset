Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All you need to know about this film is that at one point\\, while all their friends are in terrible danger of dying and they've failed their mission\\, Rose and Finn take a saddle off of space horse and proclaim it was all worth it. Full of plot holes\\, forced comedy and cheesy gotcha moments.","true":true}
