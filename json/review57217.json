Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie completely subverted my expectations\\, yet still managed to give me everything I wanted from a Star Wars movie. Rian Johnson took bold risks which may not please every viewer\\, but the brave new direction\\, stunning visuals\\, and emotion-driven characters contribute to a solid and extremely satisfying film rivaling Empire for the best in the saga.","true":true}
