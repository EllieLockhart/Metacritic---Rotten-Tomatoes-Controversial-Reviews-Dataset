Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dismal. Two and a half hours without significant character development\\, with unrecognisable returning characters\\, with cringe inducing 'comedy'\\, with lack-luster action sequences and with glaring plot holes and contrivances which have resulted in most movie goes rolling their eyes at best and giving up on the franchise at worst. If you are a Star Wars fan and by some miracle you have managed to avoid this movie thus far\\, in the name of all that is good in the world *do not see this movie*. Rotten tomatoes does not count ratings of less than 1 star in its scores\\, if it did I would rate it lower\\, and the audience score would be far\\, far lower at about 24%.","true":true}
