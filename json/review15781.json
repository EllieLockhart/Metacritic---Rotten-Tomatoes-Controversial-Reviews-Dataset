{"101487":135877,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-23","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love how the 5 star reviews start out with: \\\"Yes\\, I know there are problems\\, but.......\\\" or \\\"Best Star Wars ever\\\".  Neither of which go into detail about why they liked the movie.  Its as if these reviewers are clearly looking over the negative reviews of others\\, then giving their feedback.   Its pathetic to a striking level at how far Disney will go to make this movie not look like the shit show that it is.  2 weeks into release in China and its pulled!!??  That is beyond pathetic.  The giant turd Transformers: Revenge of the Dark Moon First Knight who gives a fuck what they call it\\, movie did better in China.  That's sad to a depressing degree for Disney.  If they do not pull Rian J from doing the planned trilogy\\, they are digging their own graves and burying themselves with the Star Wars franchise.\\n\\nIf there was ever a movie to turn you away from a beloved franchise\\, its this pile of hot monkey shit\\, called the Last Jedi.  I would prefer to see that feminazi new Ghostbusters movie with the only scenes being that of the loud mouthed black lady.  I would prefer to watch a reboot of Pluto Nash\\, rather than the Last Jedi again.  I would prefer to watch the Anakin scene where he talks about sand in a seductive way\\, over and over again for 3 hours\\, instead of seeing the Last Jedi again.  At least this scene made more sense than anything in LJ.\\n\\nLet's get to the main points:\\n\\n1) Star Wars movies have always been about the Skywalker family line.  Anakin\\, Luke and Leia.  They have been the main characters and each of them have their own story line that fulfills the heroes journey.  The main hero in the LJ is Rey\\, excuse me\\, Mary Sue.  She starts off the franchise\\, never getting hurt\\, never in real danger\\, has insane force powers\\, needs no training\\, handles a light saber better than Qui Gon (a Jedi master)\\, no flaws\\, flys the Millenium Falcon better in her first try than Han Solo after 25 years\\, etc.  I could go on and on.  The point is that she is perfect and bypassed training and hard times and is basically the most powerful person in the universe for an unknown reason.  The reason should have been laid out by Rian Johnson\\, or at least left the door open to it.  He clearly stated in an interview that Rey's parents are indeed some drunk losers that abandoned her.  Basically\\, this implies that Rey has no ties to the Skywalker line and this is the new direction of Star Wars.  Rian J just fucked JJ with this.  In Force Awakens\\, JJ set up Rian so he could easily take helm and pilot the ship on course.  Rian took the wheel and broke it in half\\, then burned the ship into the ocean\\, with this stupid idea of Rey's lineage. \\n2) Luke was a disaster\\, from start to finish.  Rian destroyed Luke not by killing him off\\, but by torturing millions of Luke fans with how the character was portrayed.  Throwing the light saber over his shoulder!!!?? Really!!??  He left a map with R2D2 to help the rebels\\, or Leia\\, find him.  When they finally do\\, he says\\, \\\"leave me alone\\\".  Seriously Rian???  You pathetic worm.  Luke's character from 40+ years is now ruined because you decided to be the guy that takes a beloved character and turn him into a crack-pot old miser.  I dont mind that Luke was killed off\\, but the way it happened made absolutely no sense.  There was no heroism\\, no set up\\, no mentioning of force projection powers\\, NADA!!!! Luke died from being stressed out.  I'll get more into this later.  RJ is turd pile for what he did to Luke's character.  No light saber duel. No show of force strength(force projection was nonsense).  No heroism. No likeability.\\n3) Continuity.  There is none.  Others have gone into this in detail\\, so I won't.  We all know that RJ did not even see the original movies or the prequel trilogy.  I dont think he even saw Force Awakens.  He was handed a golden goose and told about the instructions for how to care for it.  He said\\, \\\"dont worry about it\\, I got it.  I know what I'm doing\\\"\\, then proceeded to torture the goose before he covered it in gasoline\\, set it on fire\\, and then shot it with a bazooka.\\n4) Characters.  First off Rose is worse than Jar Jar.  Everytime I think of this cluster fuck of a character\\, I see that scene where her an Finn are being held by Storm troopers.  She then tries to angrily escape\\, while growling.  EEEESSSSHHHH.  That disturbing image is stuck in my head.  Let's get one thing clear.  Asian women are not tough.  They never have been\\, and may never will be.  Making Rose look tough\\, is like making a Darth Vader mask look happy.  It should not be done\\, because it is disingenuous.  Her character is pointless and should not have been in the movie.  We all know the reason why too.  Disney wanted to play the China race card.  I'm so glad the moved failed in China. Hopefully this moronic choice of character\\, and bad acting\\, will disappear.  Actually\\, I don't care\\,  I\\\"m not going to see anymore Star Wars movies anyways. So please......keep this cluster fuck character in.  Episode 9 can fail even more spectacularly.\\nNow for Admiral purple hair.  Another pointless character.  A nod to the Millennial generation\\, feminazi movement\\, and a hint that her and Leia are lesbian lovers.  No background\\, no story\\, bad acting\\, pointless storyline\\, no logical thinking.  \\nPoe is garbage and his character is not a hero or even likeable.  Slapped around like a little bitch.  Again\\, no backstory\\, no explanation for how he can pilot any ship as though he was God.  No reason to even root for him to succeed.  Another pile of steaming dog shit character that Rian fucked up.\\nEmo Ren went from bad to worse.  Not talking about his path in the movie\\, but his character development.  A giant crying baby that needs a hug.  He is the new supreme leader now!!?? This pathetic excuse for a Sith!? Bad guys are supposed to be feared.  This dipshit is better off shoving a porg up his ass and becoming a cross dresser.  That would make more sense in the character arc than making him supreme leader.\\n\\n4) Politics.  Disney is strong with the political correctness.  Feminism\\, Class warfare\\, Veganism\\, Capitalism.  They clearly show where they stand on all these issues.  The rich are evil\\, women are better than men\\, meat is bad\\, Capitalism is bad(although Disney is the proprietor of greed).  Disney and Johnson are shooting to capture the Millennial audience by pushing these left wing ideals.  Its almost sickening how hard they pushed their message.  I was expecting to see one of the remaining rebels that escaped at the end\\, take off their mask and be revealed to be Bernie Sanders.\\n\\nClosing thought.  The movie was a slap in the face to all Star Wars fans.  Clearly the review system\\, even on RT\\, does not tell the true story.  This was the worst Star Wars film of all time.  I am truly sad that it had to end this way.  My hope is that Disney takes a monster hit on Episode 9 and decides to change their ways\\, and stick with what worked for 40+ years.  Perhaps JJ can save what the scumbag Johnson did.  I'm afraid it might be too late.  The damage has been done.  Johnson made sure of that.  FU Rian Johnson.  FU Disney.  FU Kathleen Kennedy.  Thanks for ruining my childhood so you morons could stick your chest out and pound it like a gorilla.  FU.","true":true}
