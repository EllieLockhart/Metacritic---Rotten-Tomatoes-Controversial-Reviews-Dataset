Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is an incredibly well put together movie.  I am a huge fan of Star Wars while also being painfully aware of its flaws.  Episode VII deserved the criticisms it had for some hammy acting and lazy plot.\\n\\nEpisode VIII is a new Star Wars movie; you haven't seen this before and it boldy goes in new directions\\, getting almost everything right.  The script\\, the plot pacing\\, the characters is all fantastic.  Rian Johnson\\, cast and crew thank you.  This is the Star Wars movie I've wanted for years.","true":true}
