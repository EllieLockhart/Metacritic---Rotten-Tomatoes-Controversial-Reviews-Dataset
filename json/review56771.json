Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Then humor in this movie is just ridiculous. Unreasonable and not fitting in the moments it's used. Rian Johnson has destroyed this movie and should never have been hired to direct this film. He uses the wrong humor at the worst times\\, doesn't give certain people the roles they deserve\\, and finally\\, he makes the plot of the movie one big space race\\, which could have been dealt with at the very beginning.","true":true}
