Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While visually stunning and generally entertaining\\, the writing was extremely weak\\, horrible pacing\\, poorly timed jokes and a certain key character that they just got wrong for the first 90% of the movie. While I didn't hate it\\, definitely left feeling very disappointed. The movie pretended as if it was going to take some big risks but chickened out of all of them at the end. Not as bad as phantom menace but nowhere near Empire strikes back\\, not even as good as Force Awakens.","true":true}
