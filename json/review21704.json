Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just a poorly written movie that serves no purpose whatsoever.  Advances nothing in the saga whatsoever.  Should be considered Disney's first \\\"Legends\\\" Star Wars movie...\\n\\nThis movie is the Canto Bight of the franchise...not needed and pretty useless.","true":true}
