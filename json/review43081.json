Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie will make you want to apologize to George Lucas and quite solidly lands on the rating scale somewhere between Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones.\\n\\nI wish these movies were written and told by artistic movie makers and not those who hold the material too sacred\\, either as a religion or as a cash cow\\, to adequately add anything of value to it.\\n\\nSave the budget and recognizable actors\\, The Last Jedi dwells in the same pit of garbage that most amateur Star Wars shorts do on YouTube.  It exists because the other films exist and are good\\, almost in tribute\\, and  not to become a good film of its own.\\n\\nIt's not the beloved movie on VHS you once owned\\, but a copy of a copy of a copy. \\n\\nThe ink on the hand-written label is runny\\,  the sound is half static\\, and someone's clearly recorded it over some amateur home video that sucked even worse.","true":true}
