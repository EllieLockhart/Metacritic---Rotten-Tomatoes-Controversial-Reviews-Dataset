Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was extremely well put together.. great performances.. great writing at some points... very daring and different... but where it falls short... it falls really short. Leia in space\\, novice turned MASTER Rey\\, Master turned novice Kylo\\, Pointless Snoke\\, cowardly homicidal dissapearing Luke and worst of all... blasphemous bible burning Yoda cannot be overlooked... Such a missed opportunity... makes me appreciate what Lucas did with the prequels so much more ","true":true}
