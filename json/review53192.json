Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Being a movie lover and a writer\\, you go in a cinema with higher expectations and a different view then your average movie goer. so when i got the chance to see this film on its opening weekend\\, I was so excited! But unfortunately for me and a lot of Star Wars\\, and genuine movie fans we were let down. This 8th film in the franchise feels and views nothing like its predecessors. The film lacks in every aspect. It continuously changes its genre from being a drama\\, action\\, comedy... Its\\nflow always get broken up\\, and is always all over the place.\\nThen there is the whole scenes and unnecessary plot adjustments that dont make sense. The characters are becoming so ridiculous and pointless at the same time. Finn has no character progression what so ever. Ray literally had no training in the Jedi ways\\, as she never even had her 3rd lesson with skywalker\\, but took on the red guards and Kylo Ren. \\n\\nNot to mention Luke (him selves) has done a complete 180 turn to what his character was in the original films. Luke Skywalker opened up and nearly had the most corrupted Sith kill him as he converted Darth Vader to the light side. Luke was the beacon and the most pure association of hope\\, but in this film they make his character completely different\\, which doesn't make sense. \\nI just don't want to even mention Chewy or Snoke. Why were they in the film? They added or did nothing to the story\\, replace them with another character and nothing changes. The rebels are still being chased by the Order\\, Kylo is still bed\\, Rey is still \\\"learning\\\" and everything remained the same.\\n\\nI feel like I can write a whole essay on all the different levels this film failed. Story line\\, character development\\, terrible dialogue\\, complete waste of scenes. The Casino part was the worst.\\n\\nI just hope that J.J can at least do some damage control in the third film. \\nThe only good thing about is the visual effects. This film felt like Guardians of the Galaxy or super hero film rather then Star Wars film.","true":true}
