Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very mixed feelings with this one.  I felt that something is off about the movie. Last Jedi literally works to dismiss what The Force Awakens established mostly. By the end of this long haul\\, we are left with very little to look forward to for Episode IX. The movie is beautiful\\, the cinematography is excellent\\, the last act of battle is fresh and colorful and entertaining\\, but the forced humor\\, plot holes\\, pacing\\, story development\/character arcs bring down what could have been a great Star Wars movie. The potential was there. Execution is not good enough.","true":true}
