Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a Star Wars movie and at the end of the day based on entertainment alone the film is good. It has a lot going on for the full 2 and half hours. It remains above it's peers in action and excitement alone as a stand alone film. However in terms of how it relates to Star Wars lore is a completely different question.\\n\\nI thought this movie was good and entertaining but I didn't agree with or like basically any of the decisions made for the prequel characters or the new characters and I didn't like the decisions that were made in relation to the plot.\\n\\nThe good things about the movie: The plot isn't just about blowing up a death star for once\\, there is a lot going on on screen...plenty of exciting things to look at\\, I like Poe Dameron\\, The start of the film is very good\\, The first order are good strategists in this movie\\, the generals are good and well acted\\, I like Captain Phasma\\, I like Snokes\\, at certain points the film is visually stunning...the first order is kind of more interesting in this movie than the rebellion are.\\n\\nThe Bad things about the movie: The film is quite plot heavy about 80% plot and 20% action\\, I think children will find it hard to like this movie because it is plot heavy and too complex for children\\, There are 2-3 moments in the movie which are very cheesy and this was dissapointing\\, None of the questions which are opened up in the force awakens are treated with any significance whatsoever\\, The prequel characters epecially Luke Skywalker are handled so badly it has actually tainted the Star Wars legacy\\, Rey has still not suffered any damage or loss whatsoever: she is too perfect and this makes it hard to connect to her which is a big issue for a main character\\, It feels like there are certain feminist leanings woven into the plot just purely to make men look bad\\, Kylo Ren is not mean enough he is too much of an emo kid: although in saying that he is far more interesting than some of the main rebellion characters\\, Fin is a good character but his entire sub plot in this movie was pointles and shoe horned in for no reason\\, Some of the better characters seem now to have no future\\, some decisions were made about the force and the use of the force which may have inherently changed the franchise and not for the better.\\n\\nI actually could go on forever about the negative plot decisions in this movie and how it has negatively impacted the legacy of the franchise. However as previously stated it is still a Star Wars film and is still better than most of the action\/sci-fi films that are made in any given year. It seems like Disney felt the weight of legacy regarding the prequel characters and couldn't wait to bring Lucas characters to an end so they can do what they want with the franchise. The only thing that can be said is they do now have complete creative control of the franchise with no ties to the Lucas films. Their vision must now come through and they have no excuses\\, this is obviously what they wanted and now the 3rd film has a lot of making up to do.","true":true}
