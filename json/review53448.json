Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney really killed the Star Wars series by creating this movie\\, as well as the 7th. Please tell me that you can see that the 7th and 8th are exactly like the 4th and 5th\\, there is even a snow planet in the 8th\\, just like the 5th. Furthermore\\, the terrible humor made me choke on my popcorn\\, meaning I chocked many times. This isn't a dumb animation like the fucken Emoji movie\\, which by the way was terrible. Luke\\, Poe\\, Finn\\, and Ray's funny lines were fine\\, but what made me want to commit harakiri was when Lea started talking about her hair when she saw her brother for the first time in at least 10 years. Also\\, I know star wars is a SiFi and also has the force\\, but I think that someone surviving outer space and not dying from that blast like Lea did is really pushing the boundaries. To be honest\\, It would have made more sense if she had died there. Snoke's death was very anticlimactic and you can see the similarity between his and Palpatine's death in the 6th\\, where they both trusted their followers to do their work. You would think that the new Supreme Leader would have been smart enough to figure out that he connected Ray and Kylo too close so that their bond was strong. The French guy who turned on Fin and Rose\\, who by the way didn't really do much in the film\\, was probably the most creative character. We can't celebrate for Disney just yet\\, because the smuggler guy turned Finn and Rose in just as Lando Calrissian did to Han Solo in the 8th. I believe Disney messed up by not killing either Rose or Finn in the final scene where she saves him. Rose was a useful character up to the point that they were in battle\\, and there are too many main characters to live. The fact that Captain Phasma may have fallen to her death is unlikely\\, but if she did\\, that is really stupid on your part Disney. In final\\, I could get a bunch of guys who just do dumb Coca Cola commercials and have them make a more creative star wars than disney. First\\, they even kept the snow planet from the 4th\\, how can you be that much of a dumbass? Second\\, the repetitive death of the Supreme Leader\\, which came from the 6th. Hey\\, Rain Johnson\\, did you just copy the script from the 5th\\, add some its of the 6th and then use higher budget animations? Because if you did that\\, you did it right. I hope Karry Fisher\\, bless her soul\\, didn't see her scene with the hair thing\\, because I think she would have quit on the spot. Finally\\, I can't believe you dumb ass movie judges rated this movie a 91% and rated Jumper only 16%. At least that movie is original.","true":true}
