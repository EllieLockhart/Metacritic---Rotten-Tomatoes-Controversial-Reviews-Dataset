{"101487":129120,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely loved it\\, with both the opening night \\\"fan\\\" audience\\, and the casual movie goer who settled upon seeing \\\"the big movie that just happened to be opening this weekend\\\" on their Friday night dates\\, but the movie won't speak to the \\\"average movie goer\\\". It's EVERYTHING you want in a complex\\, thought provoking\\, science fiction movie\\, and NOTHING you'd expect from a \\\"Star Wars\\\" Movie. I think an appropriate question to ask\\, after my second viewing\\, is \\\"Did Johnson have the right to make certain choices that all but eliminated several promising plot points in Abrams TFA?\\\" Choices like splitting two character and actors with great on-screen chemistry for essentially an entire movie. Did he have the right to deliver the news of the most asked question\\, who IS Rey\\, in such a manner that MANY will be unsatisfied with. Will Abrams treat it as a lie\\, even though Johnson's answer felt so right. Did Johnson have the right to shatter the visual of such a promisingly menacing new villain by having the mask omitted from 95% of the movie\\, and most importantly\\, did Johnson have the right to choose which original characters survived and which didn't. The studio seemed to think he did and Abrams certainly wasn't going to infringe on a peer's artistic expression\\, especially if the studio had no objections. Only time\\, and episode IX\\, directed and written (for now) by Abrams\\, will tell. My opinion may change upon tomorrow's third viewing\\, but\\, while the movie is ABSOLUTELY thrilling\\, visually STUNNING\\, and\\, in many\\, MANY parts\\, THRILLING\\, I find it a little unnerving that the two biggest heart felt moments are the appearance of a 30 yr old hologram from a movie someone else made\\, and a reunion between two character who are also the creation of another \\\"master\\\". Lastly\\, I'll admit that Leia's complete 30 plus year story src would have been better completed had she chose to \\\"go down with her ship\\\" and pilot the vessel that maneuvered one of the most thrilling and amazingly directed sequences in the entire movie (the touch of total silence upon impact was genius)\\, but the trade off would have been no Luke\/Leia reunion\\, and I think Abrams probably has enough film in the can to cleverly craft the fitting end to an icon's complete story arc. But\\, as for \\\"The Last Jedi\\\"\\, like the trailer said \\\"this is not going to go the way you think!\\\".","true":true}
