{"101487":136872,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-27","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"[Important note: I don't review movies\\, and I'm NOT a Star Wars \\\"fan boy.\\\" I don't know the name of Jabba's little laughing rat guy and stuff like that. I'm simply a fan--a solid but casual fan who likes Star Trek (and Firefly\\, and Lord of the Rings\\, and Mexican food\\, and some other things that aren't legitimately compared to Star Wars) more. The reason I sat down and wrote this out was pure therapy. Just trying to get the thoughts out of my head and move on with my life.]\\n\\nAs is my standard practice with movies I reeeeally want to see\\, I went into this one in a near total information vacuum on opening weekend\\, having avoided reading anything at all about it except for a quick scan of only \\\"Fresh\\\" review summaries on RT. I usually allow myself that\\, just to reinforce the optimism and give myself the best possible shot at loving a movie I really want to love. And though you always assume there will be some fan hatred (yawn)\\, I wasn't even aware of it before I saw the movie\\, let alone familiar with any of its specifics. \\n\\nThis movie was a strange experience. I was entertained and generally positive about The Last Jedi almost all the way through it\\, glossing over everything I was tempted to be bugged by with the confidence that it all would be justified and the movie would end in amazing\\, tantalizing fashion. Then it... ended. Wait\\, what? I sat there in sort of a daze\\, got up\\, wandered out of the theater\\, thinking and thinking about what I'd just seen in context with the movie that preceded it and the fact that a movie will follow it\\, and by the time I got to my car I was grappling with the weird realization that I'd just seen a bad movie. This second movie of a trilogy I've been so excited about for so long was so bad\\, in fact\\, that I found myself uninterested in seeing the third. That's not how the middle movie of a trilogy is supposed to work\\, is it?\\n\\nThe Last Jedi didn't make you give a little laughing rat guy's as$ about any new-trilogy characters (which it desperately needed to do\\, since we're quickly running out of beloved original-trilogy characters)\\, didn't make Kylo Ren scary (which it desperately needed to do\\, since it killed off the only potentially scary bad guy)\\, didn't further the story in any significant way. It threw out every interesting question set up by The Force Awakens. Which I swear I was okay with while watching this entertaining enough movie in real time\\, assuming new interesting questions would replace them by the end. Nope. Sorry\\, but \\\"Is a love triangle between these three characters I don't care about\\, and who have no chemistry together anyway\\, going to develop?\\\" is not an interesting question.\\n\\nWhat Luke did with that light saber Rey handed him is exactly what Rian Johnson did with the entire previous movie. And that still could have worked. I'm perfectly fine with\\, \\\"Nope\\, we're not doin' that...\\\"\\, but you need to follow it with\\, \\\"This is what we're doing instead!...\\\" and give us something even better to hold onto heading into the last movie. Or you know\\, something decent to hold onto. Something... at all. I'm not picky. The key is to not leave the fans feeling totally empty-- like you just sucked out their souls\\, chewed up and digested their souls\\, and then pooped their souls back out all over them. I mean\\, thanks for not keeping my soul there\\, Mr. Johnson\\, but jeeze. Not cool.\\n\\nMy disinterest isn't complete\\, though. I'm curious how J.J. Abrams will handle Leia\/Carrie Fisher in the next movie\\, since this one-bafflingly-punted on that tricky issue (as it did with all other questions the audience had going in-punted or just said\\, \\\"Screw you! Ha-ha! NERDS!!\\\"). I'll watch IX\\, but it won't be in the theater\\, I already know that. And that's a really bizarre thing to come to terms with. Since I was 7-years-old\\, I could never have imagined that being the case with me and an upcoming Star Wars movie.","true":true}
