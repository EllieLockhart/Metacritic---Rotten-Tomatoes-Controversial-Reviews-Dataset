Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie made. Special effects are great but the plot makes no sense and it is clear that the director knows nothing about the Star Wars universe. So fire Kennedy and Johnson and get a director and producer that appreciate it. If the intent of this movie was to disenfranchise the original fans then it is a huge success.","true":true}
