The result? An experience you can't find in movies\\, series\\, books and even in other games. The amazingly beautiful aesthetics of the chapters and cut-scenes are breathtaking\\, this improves the already evolved gameplay\\, proving that minor changes in combat\\, dogding and interactions can change the whole experience.\rWhat about the narratives aspects of it? Mesmerizing\\, yet imperfect. Thankfully\\, the weak story of one of the protagonists and its excess of (not so useful) flashbacks is fastly omitted by a great character study of these two beings and their arcs that resonates in a laudable theme. The choices that the developers went through the game are bold\\, but creates an emotional roller coaster to the player improving his\/her experience.\rConclusion? It's indeed a must play to all PlayStation user\\, the unification of an emotional plot and an active and incredible gameplay creates a truly wonderful game made with blood\\, sweat and tears from the developers and actors. Enjoy it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
