Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I literally made a rotten tomatoes account to clear the waters and write this review. This is by far the most intelligent\\, exciting\\, unpredictable\\, and creative Star Wars movie of all time. Rian Johnson is ahead of his time. This film was so different from the rest yet so necessary and fitting. The character development was outstanding. (THESE CHARACTERS HAVE FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS JUST LIKE US. IT\u2019S CRAZY RIGHT???) This was the movie that Star Wars needed. Ill admit\\, I was thrown off in the beginning because of how different it was\\, but it ended up becoming top 2 in my favorite SW films of all time. This movie will blow you away. It is so different from the rest of the series yet so necessary. I\u2019m still speechless with how unpredictable the movie was. I advise you to please watch this film. Rian Johnson has the type of innovative and intelligent mind that this franchise has been missing. When this trilogy is all said and done\\, I think we will all finally realize that. ","true":true}
