Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was THE best movie since episode V. There is no doubt that there is a new standard to measure all future Star Wars movies against.  I saw the original trilogy as a child in the cinema and have no qualms in stating that not only is this a great stand alone film but that it also brings back what it means to be Star Wars","true":true}
