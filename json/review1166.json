Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A painful watch for all true star wars fans :( i give it 1 star for the special effects and music but almost everything else was terrible. The finger points directly at Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy for making the worst ever star wars film\\, doesn't even deserve the name star wars tbh.","true":true}
