Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The trailers made me think the movie would be different but it turned out even worse then force awakens. Ruining beloved characters and killing all theories. Hope episode 9 turns it around","true":true}
