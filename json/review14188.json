Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I gave this film two stars bc visually it is stunning and I thought the actors all did a fine job.  The problem is that the writing is horrible.  At least 3 or 4 parts in the movie were terribly far-fetched\\, and some of the plot holes were huge and nonsensical.  Beautiful to watch\\, but inexcusably bad for plot.","true":true}
