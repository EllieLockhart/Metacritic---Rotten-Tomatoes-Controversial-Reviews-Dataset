Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let me throw my hat in the ring and say that the Last Jedi is an enjoyable film\\, like all Star Wars movies truly are. They're not perfect\\, but that's what adds to the charm that has made them a staple in pop culture and our hearts. \\nThat said\\, the Last Jedi doesn't reverse the problems with the Force Awaken\\, instead making them much\\, much worse. This is the first Star Wars movie I have zero desire to rewatch\\, in whole or a specific scene by scene. Instead of looking to expand the universe or deepen emotional connections\\, Johnson resorts to inconsistent pacing\\, cheap gimmicks\\, and asking us to suspend too much disbelief. This wasn't science fiction\\, this was lunacy. \\nThe Last Jedi is (at times) beautiful to watch. You want to like half the characters\\, but the other half\\, particularly the new ones\\, less Laura Dern\\, are at best bland. The changes to old characters are deeply concerning\\, and I think it's fair to start questioning Kathleen Kennedy's leadership. \\nI'll be in line for Episode IX\\, even though it seems like it'll be more of the same. If this wasn't Star Wars\\, this would be a very solid movie. But it is Star Wars\\, and the audience is smart enough to expect more.","true":true}
