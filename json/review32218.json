Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars at its worst. The one star is for the Kylo Ren storyline. Everything else in this movie was poorly written. Classic characters made to be cartoony versions of themselves. Awkward appearance by Yoda\\, laughing as he set the tree and books on fire? Huh? What a joke this movie is. This is how Star Wars ends with thunderous applause...","true":true}
