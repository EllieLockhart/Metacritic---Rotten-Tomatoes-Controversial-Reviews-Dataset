Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"THIS IS NOT A MASTERPIECE! Took what JJ started & spat on it and through it out the window\\, \\\"if Rey & Kyli are so similar why didn't Rey let Kylie get a force vision for the Skywalker saber\ud83d\ude12\\\" ep2 & ep5 are 10x better then this clumsy mess","true":true}
