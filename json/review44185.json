Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To me\\, the movie was just fine. I found myself frequently asking myself \u201cWhen are all the characters going to actually meet up?\u201d. Not to mention the fact that the character of Supreme Leader Snoke was completely wasted. And this might be just a personal preference thing but what was the sparkly gold robe he was wearing? He\u2019s supposed to look menacing not like the space version of Gianni Versace! Also\\, the whole three different subplots with Rey\\, Finn\\, and Poe just didn\u2019t make sense to me.
