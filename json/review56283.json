Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such a lot of nonsense talked about the Star Wars canon. All that critical dissection and nerdy introspection. Bottom line is that it should have been wound up after the Empire Strikes Back. Other than Rogue\\, which is a stand alone film that can be judged on it's own merits\\, the others from Return of the Jedi.onwards are all terrible movies. This\\, like it's predecessor The Force Awakens\\, suffers from the cardinal sin of many movies in that it's just really\\, really boring. Forget the 'rich legacy' and view it as a science fiction movie you've just paid good money to see. And don't get me started on the muppet characters.","true":true}
