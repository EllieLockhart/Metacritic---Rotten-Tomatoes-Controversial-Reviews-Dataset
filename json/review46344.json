Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was it the best Star Wars? No. We're there things I would change? Of course. It is hard to please the crowd for movies like these this day in age. With all the fan theories\\, and online reviewer. When the therios don't come true people get upset. That's why when I know I'm going to see a movie I don't watch theories or trailers. I just go and enjoy what the movie has to offer. I liked it it though.","true":true}
