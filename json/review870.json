Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A nihilistic hash that sets out to demolish the legacy of Star Wars. It's too bad that the current political agenda of the writer\/director overwhelmed the desire to tell a good story\\, but in fact treat the original story line as something that actively needed to be destroyed and replaced.  Aside from that\\, the plot holes\\, discontinuities\\, rewriting of characters like Luke and meaningless of it all are so maddeningly bad. Such a shame and wasted opportunity.","true":true}
