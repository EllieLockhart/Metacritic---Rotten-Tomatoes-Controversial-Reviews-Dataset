Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a fan that grew up watching the original trilogy (4\/5\/6)\\, I was super excited when Disney purchased the rights to the franchise. Surely a studio with that kind of resources would advance the franchise. Unfortunately\\, that stopped when Johnson and Kennedy took over the reins. Retconning lore to suit whatever vision they have for the Star Wars franchise is unconscionable imo. The critics are wrong on this one\\, it is not a good movie and I am super disappointed. The way they did the sendoff for the most lauded characters in SciFi history was appalling. Watch something else!","true":true}
