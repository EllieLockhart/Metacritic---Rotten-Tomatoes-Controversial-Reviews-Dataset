Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film could have been spectacular; Sadly\\, it died on the editing room floor. all CHaracter dialogue for the first half of the movie is exposition and can't do anything to save the already forgetful characters.Suffers the exact same problems as Avatar: the last Airbender; the only difference is that this costed a bazillion dollars in advertising\\, and couldn't afford to fail.","true":true}
