Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"30 years have passed since Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor sacrificed their lives for delivering the planes of the Death Star to the Rebel Alliance\\, and no single alliance ship carries their names?\\n\\nThe Last Jedi has been produced after Rogue One. Rian Johnson had enough time to think about that.\\nInstead\\, he chooses to name Resistance MC85 Star Cruiser after an admiral completely unknown to the moviegoers...\\n\\nI would have deeply appreciated Resistance MC85 Star Cruiser known as the Raddus be named Jyn Erso or Cassian Andor.\\nThat would have had a completely different effect on the fans.\\nIt would have shown respect.\\n\\nI think Rian Johnson did not watch Rogue One\\, though.\\nI also think he did not even watch the Original Trilogy.\\nHe is such a hack.\\n\\nWhen I see a picture of him posing with a SW toy\\, it brings to my mind the image of a hunter putting his foot on the corpse of a beautiful animal he just killed.","true":true}
