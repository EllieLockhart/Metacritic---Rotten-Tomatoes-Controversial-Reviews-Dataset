Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Definitely a lot of bold decisions. There were also some very cool visual moments: the light speed attack against Snoke's ship was awesome\\, the way Luke and Kylo's final fight went down was an amazing visual and idea\\, and so was the battle in Snoke's chamber. But\\, even though those moments rocked\\, they didn't grab my emotions\/didn't resonate. \\n\\nI wasn't sucked into the story\\, which makes me feel as though I'd give the film a solid C+. I didn't feel for the characters at any moment. I would have liked a sharper focus on the experience of fewer main characters. Instead\\, he spread the story really thin.","true":true}
