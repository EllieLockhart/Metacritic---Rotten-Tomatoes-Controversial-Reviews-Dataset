Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A disservice to the franchise and a big way to s**t  all over the saga legacy and the characters\\, old and new\\, we all grew to love. If they wanted to put an end to the era of Skywalker Family Drama on Star Wars\\, I'm sure there were ways to do that which still respected the fans and the legacy. Oh well\\, what else should we expect from Disney?","true":true}
