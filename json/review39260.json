Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film has some amazing moments and was relatively enjoyable\\, but there were too many character motives that were just not believable and some shoddy dialogue here and there.  I think the movie falls flat the instant they start to flesh out why Luke is on that island and where his character is at.  Suddenly this new trilogy makes no sense with the previous one and all the lessons Luke apparently learned do not apply here.  Luke is a character that was able to sacrifice himself for the most murderous Sith in the Galaxy because of the shred of conflict within him and the spark of hope.  This same guy years later somehow devolves into considering murdering younglings (see what I did there) out of fear.  Le sigh.......","true":true}
