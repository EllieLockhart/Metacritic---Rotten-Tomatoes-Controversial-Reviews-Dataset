Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was checking my watch toward the end\\, just hoping for the movie to be over soon. People criticize The Force Awakens for being overly derivative\\, but at least it felt like Star Wars. This movie did not feel like Star Wars. It felt like some bizarre amalgam of Disney kids movies with inappropriate levels of humor\\, pointless and disjointed plot lines\\, and sloppy writing of major characters. The Force Awakens built up the story to such impressive heights\\, and this movie just crumpled it all up and tossed it in the trash in favor of kiddie humor and nonstop\\, exhausting action. This wasn\u2019t Star Wars. It was Disney. ","true":true}
