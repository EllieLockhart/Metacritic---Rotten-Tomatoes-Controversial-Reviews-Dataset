Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To each his own I guess but I really liked this movie and am very shocked to see how many people truly hate it. I question how much the audience rating on here applies to the general public. It seems suspiciously low as if some jilted fan submitted bad review after bad review from different accounts. Maybe I'm wrong on that but I have a hard time buying the current 49% audience score. The movie had some flaws and plot missteps but I watch these movies with an open mind and am not the type of fan that expects the franchise to meet my personal expectations with every plot decision. This movie has taught me that\\, like in politics\\, there are conservative and progressive Star Wars fans and this movie has taught me that I fall on the progressive side. It was a truly exhilarating first watch for me on opening night and no matter what you think of the plot\\, visually this movie is as innovative and cutting edge as they come. Just absolutely gorgeous cinematography and visual effects. Amazing. Are there things I would have done differently? Absolutely\\, but I love and appreciate Rian Johnson's vision for this film and expect Episode 9 will button up at least a few of the lingering questions and situations in the trilogy's close to fans' satisfaction. I respect people's right to hate this movie\\, but it was honestly some of the most fun I've ever had watching a new SW movie for the first time.","true":true}
