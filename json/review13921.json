Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you are looking for simplistic storytelling\\, this movie is not for you (Stick with the Prequels) However\\, if you are ready for depth\\, emotion\\, and intelligent storytelling\\, you are going to Love Star Wars: The Last Jedi. The characters have clear 3 dimensions and growth. The action is great but doesn't define the  movie. I highly recommend","true":true}
