Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The BS Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy try tp sell as feminism rather reminds me of what anti-feminists think feminism is\\, ie. women being horrible to men for no reason (Poe's and Finn's storylines)\\, uber-strong female characters with no depth (Rey - Rian Johnson doesn't CARE about her\\, she could as well be a lamp with inexplicable superpowers - this isn't feminist\\, it's bad writing!)\\, and in the end this movie is about Kylo Ren's whining and destroying Luke Skywalker\\, while the lore doesn't get developped at all\\, the new characters get NO depth\\, the story barely progresses ... plotholes appear that are deeper than the Mariania Trench... Stop using your political agenda to declare that this movie is garbage. It is garbage for countless reasons but not bc Rian Johnson or Kathleen Kennedy care about feminism or diversity... bc they don't and Rian Johnson is an AWFUL writer who has the creativity of a toast...","true":true}
