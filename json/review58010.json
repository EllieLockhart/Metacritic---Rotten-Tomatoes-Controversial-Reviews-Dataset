Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While I was entertained and at the end of the day it is a Star Wars movie I'm feeling a bit disappointed and frustrated by the Last Jedi. This seems to be a classic case of an insecure director trying too hard to be original and flex their movie muscles. The Force Awakens honored the past and ushered in the new. Last Jedi simply throws tradition away in a way that simply doesn't fit in the Star Wars world. That's why I had such a hard time with this film. Without giving away any spoilers I just didn't believe that some of the major actions made by key characters were actually what THEY would have done and\/or wanted. Instead we got Rian Johnson force choking each character into actions they probably wouldn't choose for themselves. Curious to see if it grows on me but at the moment I'm very underwhelmed.","true":true}
