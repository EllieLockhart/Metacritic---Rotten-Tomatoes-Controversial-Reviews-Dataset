Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I signed up to Rotten Tomatoes just so I could write this little rant about the dumpster fire known as the last jedi.. 1. I use to be a huge fan of the Star Wars films and all the original characters. i have gone to the cinema to watch a number of them and was elated when Force Awakens was  announced. needless to say it was a huge disappointment  in its self but I thought hey maybe episode 8 will fix the problems and have a great comeback for Luke Skywalker.. wow was I terribly mistaken. so Disney gave the this project to some novice who has no concept of the franchise whatsoever\\, disrespects Mark Hamill by wasting his time and making him look like a washed up depressed old man\\, plots that go nowhere\\, boring hack script about animal abuse\\,slavery and feminism. I am FINISHED with Star Wars. no more movies or games or toys ect. NOTHING. I will always appreciate the original trilogy but screw the prequels\\, rogue one\\,force awakens and now last jedi. thanks alot disney you have ruined the story for me. you should be ashamed of that big heap of crap you call a movie. the writer-directer should be fired and put out on the street with the trash and I hope disney takes a nosedive and people boycott your crap. I for one am finished so to hell with your crap.","true":true}
