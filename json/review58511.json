I take the role of reviewing a game seriously first thing someone should do is play the game if you loved part 1 give it a shot with open arms regardless you will love the actual experience the gameplay. The story itself is a rollercoaster ride of emotions and lets not forget This is post apocalyptic nothing about these guys you're fighting is modern day civilized. Its chaotic its dark its adult all the way. For all those soft reviews that tell you about some agenda sadly they have not experienced it for themselves and they clearly are easily swayed by internet \\\"agendas\\\". Don't be a sheep play the **** yourself its amazing.Or don't and miss out on potentially once in a lifetime experience. However lets be real here this game deserves no less than a 9 if you simply are upset about story. Graphically name something better I dare you gameplay improved on part one all the way and that game received massive praise the soundtrack is one of the best ever. Any zeros for this game is just mindless and its the entire reason why we have professionals who do reviews. Take your feelings and shove them but guess what youre not doing review bombers.... you will not slow the sales of something bigger then your feelings :) play the game you owe it to yourself\u2026 Expand","true":true}
