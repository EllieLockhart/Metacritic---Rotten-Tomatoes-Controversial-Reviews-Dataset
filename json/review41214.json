Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie have some of the best scene and visual that I have ever seen in starwars but when I watch the movie some other scene where not working for me\\, the rhythm of the movie was cut because of them. Princess Leah flying\\, some slow motion fake suspense did not do it for me. Rian J is a great director but was not for me surrounded properly to help him in the decision department.","true":true}
