Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By far the worst starwars movie\\n\\nAs a standalone movie terrible. Via pacing\\, plot holes\\, shallow characters....\\n\\nAll the force awakens questions answered in the most blaa way possible (is Rey Luke's daughter\\, is r a former pupil\\, who is snoke\\, who are Rey's parents\\, what has Like been up too)\\n\\nIt literally feels like a slap in the face.\\n\\nI'm the first 3-5 minutes something just felt off\\, around the halfway point I considered walking out\\, at the end I facepalmed myself in disbelief.\\n\\nHow they portrayed Luke\\, super Leia\\, pointless and irritating Rose\\, unexplained and unwarranted powers of Rey\\, the most pathetic space pursuit in history\\, consistent breaking of lore and universe rules\\, weird social justice warrior undertones\\, I could go on and on.\\n\\nAn absolute travesty. Taking a massive dump over the whole brand. I will NEVER watch a starwars in the cinema again\\, nor pay coin to watch.\\n\\nRogue one was awesome. This is horrendous.who on earth are these terrible directors.\\n\\nShame on Disney\\, shame on the directors. But what I they care... Because dollars right :\/","true":true}
