Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney made this movie for 2 reasons. To make a political statement and to star wars toys. Its funny though\\, how they even failed to make a quality film that even a child would be like: \\\"This sucks dad\\, lets watch Jumanji.\\\" This is coming from a guy who memorized the whole star wars encyclopedia when Star wars still had magic: \\\"It's time for Star Wars\\, to end.\\\"","true":true}
