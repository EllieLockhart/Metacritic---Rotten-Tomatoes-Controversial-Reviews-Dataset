Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It sucked in every way possible.  More proof that critics are shills.\\nAnd the proof is in... only 1 award for the whole year and only from Golden Tomato: Best Sci-Fi\/Fantasy... yeah\\, shills confirmed.","true":true}
