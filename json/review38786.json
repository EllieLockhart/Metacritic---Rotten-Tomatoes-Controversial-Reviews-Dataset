Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They didn't respect what was set up in the Force Awakens\\,\\nThe movie was slow and had many things happen just to push \\\"plot\\\" forward.\\nI feel they didn't watch the original trilogy to understand how Luke would react\\, I personally don't consider this film Canon\\, they should have gone with what was already written in books\\, the expanded universe had many better stories than this one. \\nI really hope they fix this in episode 9\\, but I don't have my hopes up. \\n\\nRight after watching this movie in the Theater I couldn't even comment on everything I didn't like\\, my group of friends and I all were kind of lost\\, I rewatched twice to see if it got any better... it didn't.. this is a bad film.\\n\\nOnly pros\\, it's beautifully shot\\, but even then\\, I find the CG was prequelish and not as good as Force Awakens.","true":true}
