Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was unfortunately a succession of trivialities\\, bad jokes\\, jokes that did not work and refurbished dialogues out of older Star Wars movies. I would not say that I am a diehard fan\\, simply a guy that grew up with the Star Wars movies\\, but I am utterly disappointed. \\nSPOILER\\n\\nIn the first half\\, the movie is missing a deeper story\\, starting with the destruction of a big spaceship in less than 10 minutes and then following a sequence where the last rebel ships fly through space and only burn fuel. \\nRey and Luke have a widely predictable story\\, that misses depth and development and could've been shown in about 20 minutes and Luke is milking an elephant seal?(why) Dramatic or a bit darker scenes are often destroyed with bad slapstick comedy\\, e.g. Rey discovers her force with the lightsaber\\, splits the stone in half\\, boom\\, it drops on this aliens wheelbarrow and so on. \\nSnoke's and Rey's backstory is not existent\\, basically THE most speculated things before. I know\\, one could say\\, it's all because the movie tries to end everything that links them to the one before and wants to be totally new and different from every Star Wars before\\, which I would've loved\\, but in my opinion it's just a poor plot without a deep backstory\\, poorly written and way too predictable. Like I said before\\, too much slapstick\\, this wannabe cute little birds and LUKE IS MILKING A FREAKING ELEPHANT SEAL! Why? :D","true":true}
