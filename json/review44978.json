Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Uma nova Jedi vai atr\u00e1s de Luke Skywalker para que ajude a enfrentar os vil\u00f5es que est\u00e3o atacando a resist\u00eancia... eles est\u00e3o prestes a serem todos abatidos pelo cruzador do mal quando conseguem escapar uma meia d\u00fazia em uma nave\\, Luke usa toda sua for\u00e7a para se transportar e ajudar a resist\u00eancia a ganhar tempo para escapar...
