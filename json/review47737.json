Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When I went to see this movie I went with wide eyes of hope but this movie was a let down. The worst scene was when Rose ended Finn's dramatic sacrifice just to give her own character a meaningless sacrifice that added more questions to the film such as \\\"Why didn't the First Order open fire on them while they were kissing right in front of First Order troops?\\\" This movie is a joke.","true":true}
