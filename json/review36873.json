Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was a slap in the face to the original franchise\\, and to Luke's lack of character\/story. Astral projections are not what true fans expect out of a so called kick-ass Jedi.","true":true}
