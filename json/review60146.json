First I\u2019ll say what I liked. Awesome graphic. Very beauty setting. Awesome horsey.  Now the bad. I played this game hoping for Ellie and Joel\u2019s relationship to grow and for them to finally discuss the firefly stuff and naughty dog ruined it. Like obviously the game is set in a terrible post apocalyptic world with zombie like enemies so **** will always go down. But no one asked for these random ass characters from Seattle to come in? Literally no one asked for Abby? We wanted a growth story with Joel and Ellie not some bull**** story about revenge that has been told 90 million times already???  The whole game is stressful and made me cry the whole time? Like I get that it\u2019s supposed to be an emotional tough world but the happy moments in the previous game were what made it so good. The last of us part 2 just is one terrible thing after another with no choice but to sit through it with the only good parts being the flashbacks with Joel. Idk naughty dog really trashed this story and characters. It\u2019s just really sad. Like I know it\u2019s a game but I felt like we all looked up to Joel because we felt the hurt when he lost his own daughter. Just to **** kill him when he\u2019s become like a dad to another? Terrible writing. Like my own dad died two years ago and seeing Joel die is like reliving that memory so thank you naughtydog for that. Joel and Ellie deserved a better story where the enemies were just zombies and actual bad guys. Stop trying to make stories about revenge and stop making zombie apocalypse stories without emphasis on the actual zombies? It\u2019s like his game was trying to be the walking dead tv series and we all know that went to shut the second it became more about enemy humans rather than enemy zombies.. Anyway the gameplay is good but everything else sucked\u2026 Expand","true":true}
