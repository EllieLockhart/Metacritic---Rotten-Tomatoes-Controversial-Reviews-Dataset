The characters you've known from the previous game somehow got severly dumm and angsty. The story is bleak and very straightforward\\, with visible attempts at cheaply manipulating the recipient being more than frequent. The characters don't grow\\, they act illogically\\, generally come out as unlikable and seem to be wrapped in a plot armor 10 inch thick. The comparisons with fan-fiction levels of writing are actually one hundred percent spot-on. I'm not even going to talk about the controversial agenda pushing that's going on\\, I'm sure everyone has already made their picture about that.\rThe other bad part is the combat. Naughty Dog has never been famous for their combat systems. However\\, as combat is a VERY integral part of this game (more so than in the first one\\, dare i say)\\, the issues only rise in prominence and often you'll question yourself \\\"what the **** just happened?\\\" or \\\"did the camera\/auto-targetting\/glitches (yes\\, the game has some minor glitches in the enemy AI) just decide to **** me over?\\\". The combat and crawling through maps looking for hidden resources is fun a while\\, but gets repetitive and annoying very quickly and it only gets worse as the game goes on.\r\rIf you've loved the original The Last of Us because of its combat\\, you're going to be happy with this game. If you\u00a8ve enjoyed it for its story or characters\\, you're in for a very unpleasant surprise. Save your 60$\\, buy on sale if you want to try.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
