Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only positive I can say about this movie are its visuals\\, but there lies also a big problem with the writing. A lot of style over substance so to say.\\nIt seems like they've tried to keep the audience in aw\\, to gloss over a lackluster script\\, filled with way to many plotholes\\, unnecessary sciences & plotlines\\, and unbelievably overstuffed with Bathos. \\nThe script seems desperate to reverse the audience expectations in every moment\\, which leaves you with not much but confusion and pretty scenery. \\nThe handling of the canon is probably the worst I've ever witnessed in a sequel. Established characters are completly rewritten and made fools just for a cheap laugh. It's fine to introduce a new generation\\, but please leave to story you carry on with a little bit of dignity.","true":true}
