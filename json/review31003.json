Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disjointed and not in line with either the original trilogy or the prequel trilogy. So many superfluous characters added that never moved the story forward. I never thought I'd see the day where I was nostalgic for frigging jar jar binks.","true":true}
