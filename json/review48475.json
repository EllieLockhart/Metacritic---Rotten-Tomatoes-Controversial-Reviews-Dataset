Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With the exception of a largely unnecessary subplot\\, this movie was amazing. Good acting\\, fight choreography\\, and story\\, with lots of twists that were unexpected. Once Episode 9 comes out\\, people will be able to appreciate this one more\\, I'm sure\\, since it will answer the questions they want.","true":true}
