Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is narratively confused.  There were profound problems with how the several subplots were created\\, told and integrated with each other\\, and the core conceit was very difficult to swallow or care much about. The resolution of the narratives relied on plot holes so large that one could literally fit a Repulican cruiser.\\n\\nThe devotion of substantial screen time and narrative effort to cast and themes that had no appreciatable narrative payoff contributed to the narrative dissonnance. That some of those decisions seemed to be driven by a desire to parade obvious gender stereotypes\\, while hamfistedly subverting others\\, was just salt in the wound. Clear opportunities were missed to have genuinely interesting character dilemmas played out\\, and have genuinely interesting parts of the world built further and explored\\, in favour of vainglorious moralising. \\n\\nVisually\\, the movie is striking\\, however many scenes seemed  constructed for nothing but spectacle\\, which compounded the already substantial narrative problems.\\n\\nThis movie wanted to strike the tone of Empire Strikes Back\\, but it feels more like watching Michael Bay and the writing is straight up fanfic quality. \\n\\nA weak addition to the franchise.","true":true}
