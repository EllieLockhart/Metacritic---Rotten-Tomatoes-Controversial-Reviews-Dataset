Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked it a lot more on a second viewing\\, and even though I saw the original in '77\\, I'm not certain I'm the target market for the latest instalment.  Like a lot of people\\, I had issues with the flying Leia\\, overuse of porgs\\, racing-goats and crystal foxes\\, a messy scene as a whole on the casino planet\\, Finn being used as a plot device whenever anything New Order is required\\, and the dumbing down of Hux for comedic effect to name a few.  I actually had no issues with Luke's characterization\\, but the scene with the Praetorian guard left me flat\\, as it relied too much on Snoke's guard being flashy and wielding \\\"cool-ninja-weapons\\\"\\, and less on core choreography of what could have been an amazing sabre battle. Personally it falls below the original trilogy\\, but above the prequels for me.","true":true}
