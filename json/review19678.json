Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a good movie\\, it had some very strong moments\\, but........ there were some gaps that could have been cleaned up. The return of Luke Skywalker was huge and did not disappoint. There should have been more in depth coverage of Rey's and Skywalkers training and time together. The introduction of DJ was a missed opportunity\\, Since Solo was killed off\\, every group of do-gooders and knights need a rogue to do their dirty work and DJ would have fit the bill perfectly.  Good movie\\, too many missed opportunities.","true":true}
