Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Having grown up on the originals back in the 80s\\, I can see why this film would challenge lifelong fans such as myself\\, however I find it to be an excellent transitional film\\, bridging the gap\\, aggressively between the old and the new.  It's a theme repeated multiple times in the dialogue of the film and it's intentionally meant to be jarring to the traditionalist.  However\\, I believe the film is creating a platform with which to end the old storyline and launch us into a much broader galaxy worth exploring outside the orbit of the Skywalkers.","true":true}
