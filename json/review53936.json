Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely loved it. I loved the story and especially the mystery relationship between Ben and Rey by way of the force. I also loved that Luke is very much an enigma in his older age because\\, yes he is not the Luke Skywalker of old but he is the Luke Skywalker that was betrayed by his beloved nephew and it has caused him to rethink his entire philosophy on the Jedi Order. But in the end\\, Luke and Rey both come to realize what IS and is NOT considered the correct path to go down. I feel like this film was beautifully executed and left me wanting more at the end. As it should have!","true":true}
