Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi has a lot of incredibles scenes. The first act of the movie maybe is a little easy and the jokes in there are very forced\\, but the second and third act\\, really\\, are very epic. The film has shoking moments\\, things you can\u00b4t to see in the moment will surprise you to the ends the movie. The plot of Finn and Rose is not so interesting than all the scenes in the island with the Jedi Skywalker\\, but gives tension and learning moments about the darkside\\, the light and the objective of the story to show the people the balance of the force.\\n The spaceships battles are a visual show\\, and the battles with the lightsabers are AMAZING. Great performances\\, great CGI effects\\, epic moments and a successful change in the Star Wars saga.","true":true}
