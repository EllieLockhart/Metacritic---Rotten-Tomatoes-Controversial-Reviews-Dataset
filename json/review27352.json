{"101487":161003,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Originally I liked this movie\\, but after some thoughts\\, the movie leaves a very bad taste in my mind.  Something is just fundamentally wrong with the story.  It seems that a lot of people have this kind of experience.  Now why is that?  Most films do not do that\\, why this one does?  I think this is something the writers of later Star Wars films need to seriously consider.\\n\\nNow I will offer my 2 cents as to why that is.  But first realize that it's not just the hardcore fans that may not like this movie.  I am a fan\\, but not a hardcore one.  I only watched Star Wars movies and nothing else (no books\\, animation\\, lore etc)\\, probably like most people.  The reason is more fundamental than the SW universe itself.\\n\\nMight contain spoilers.\\n\\nThe writer tries very hard to tackle many themes in this movie\\, and he\/she failed in many of them.  Let's take a look at 2 of them:\\n\\nThe Force is For Everyone \/ Everything: Fundamentally\\, there is nothing wrong with this idea\\, and it does not violates the stories of previous Star Wars films (there were many Jedi\/Sith\\, and Obi-wan also explained it to Luke in similar ways etc).  But the problem is: to use\/harness something\\, one should require to  WORK for it\\, even if they are talented.  It's like writers need to learn and practice how to write\\, engineers need to learn math and science\\, even talented Mozart need to learn from very young age about violin & piano\\, and Jedi needs to learn about the force and practice using it.  But in this movie\\, people can use & harness something so great without learning & practicing.  That just strays tooooooo far away from people's everyday experience\\, and when this happens\\, people will feel some kind of fundamental inconsistency (Mary Sue etc)\\, and start to feel that this is a bad story.\\nFlawed Heroes: This is another theme the movie tries to develop in several plot lines\\, but failed.  Once again\\, there is nothing wrong with this idea\\, and flawed heroes\\, tragic heroes\\, legend vs reality theme has been tackled in previous SW films.  However\\, when you have characters that act in ways that do not follow common sense\\, you need to clarify it somehow.  And when you have an established character that did something so fundamentally against what they were...it just does not work.  Flawed heroes do not mean a fundamental change in characters\\, it just meant that heroes have BOTH vice and virtue as well.  \\n\\nThere might be many other failed themes\\, but these are 2 I can think of now.  The writers of SW really need to think about what kind of story are they trying to tell\\, instead of trying and failing all over the place.","true":true}
