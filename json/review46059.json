Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning but unfortunately the story was a mess. Pointless side character stories and poor editing makes this movie a bit of a mission to watch. Characters that were built up in episode 7 were discarded with little further development and weird force abilities make this a disappointing film on par with the prequels. As much as I wanted to see Luke Skywalker again\\, I feel this movie has completely missed what made the originals so fun and inspiring.","true":true}
