I regret to inform that the story in this game is absolutely terrible. There is a lack of respect for the characters from the first game\\, the ones that I loved very much\\, like Joel and Ellie. The story is a basic revenge plot with a modern \\\"subversion of expectations\\\" at the end which I didn't enjoy at all.\r\rI am mourning the franchise\\, because this game really sank the ship. It really really did.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
