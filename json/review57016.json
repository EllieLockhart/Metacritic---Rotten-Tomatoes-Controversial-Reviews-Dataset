{"101487":180746,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-03","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This entire film\\, how it treats the legacy\\, how much thought & effort the director and team put into this film....can all be summed up perfectly by the character allegedly Luke Skywalker\\, taking the iconic lightsaber from Rey and tossing it off the cliff over his shoulder. That scene summed up the entire film. Only after watching the entire rest of this fubar did I understand that scene in the beginning. Maybe the writing\/directing of that scene is more clever than I give credit for.\\n\\nAside from a couple of awesome scenes (from a cinematography standpoint)....this film was a complete waste of potential compared to what the trailer had us believed it would be (like some sort of jedi mind trick) and a pile of utter garbage.\\n\\nThis is not a Marvel Comic superhero film that can be done later\\, differently. This is Star Wars canon you're messing with. There's no going back and redoing it. Do these so-called directors understand this?\\n\\nThis movie has an enormous amount of things wrong with it from a Star Wars standpoint\\, but we have to first deal with the fact this movie failed from a movie standpoint\\, period. Evaluating it afterwards feels like we are grading a film student's first attempt at screen writing.  Lack of cohesiveness\\, terrible mistakes from a basic film production standpoint.  The writing\\, my goodness\\, the writing. And science.  We've got a director that doesn't seem to even understand how things work IN SPACE.  Bombs don't fall due to gravity.  Things get sucked out of bay doors when they are open in space.  Ships continue in motion whether or not a ship runs out of fuel\\, they don't come to a stop.  This is space\\, not the ocean. Why are we dealing with stuff like this\\, in a Star Wars movie???\\n\\nThis movie gets 1 star only for special fx & a couple pretty cool scenes\\, but other than that\\, a heaping pile of trash. I will be reading spoilers before seeing Ep9 because I will not be spending another dime on this \\\"trilogy\\\" until I know for a fact they put in the effort for a decent script\\, a decent story line\\, decent world-building\\, decent character development\\, decent basic science for Yoda-sake\\, a decent movie period - worthy of the Star Wars name.","true":true}
