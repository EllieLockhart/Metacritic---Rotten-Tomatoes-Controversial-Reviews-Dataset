Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Instalment 8 of this epic saga\\, and it's starting to feel very distant from the original episodes\\, as more and more of the classic characters give way to the new Jedi blood. Disappointed in the lack of memorable moments\\, but I feel as was the case with the middle film of the other trilogies\\, this is all about taking us on a journey to get to the big finale. Questions are left unanswered\\, battles are brewing\\, and the problem of how Leia will be replaced given Carrie Fishers passing is the talk on everyone's lips. There is a lot of Deja Vu creeping in with some of the storylines\\, as people all seem to be related to one another\\, and everyone can see the light and dark in each other as they grapple for places on the First Order and Resistance. Nevertheless\\, as a Star Wars fan\\, this is very easy viewing and an enticement for yet another final chapter.","true":true}
