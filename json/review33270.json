Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Superb acting and visuals cannot overcome stupendous plot holes and dishonourable insults of old characters (i.e #NotMyLuke). Vast attention has been paid to the 'lore'\\, purely to subvert almost everything noteworthy about Star Wars. 'Let the past die; kill it if you have to'  is the real moral message of this film: Alas\\, applying the moral code of a genocidal\\, patricidal\\, fascist emo will not produce good cinema.","true":true}
