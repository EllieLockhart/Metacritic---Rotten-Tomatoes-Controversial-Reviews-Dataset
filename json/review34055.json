Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible writing. Rian forgot that this film was part of a trilogy and misses the opportunity to create a great sequel to a film that leaves audiences wanting more but fails. The most unforgivable act though\\, was the way they treated the previous films and ignored past lore and character development. They destroyed Luke's legacy and ruined one of the most iconic characters of all time.","true":true}
