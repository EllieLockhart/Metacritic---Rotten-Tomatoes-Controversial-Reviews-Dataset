Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hey y'all! Did you like the 2009 Star Trek movie with all of its 721 lens flare? Yes? Well\\, congratulations! This movie is for you!  Do you think that the old Star Wars movies were lame\\, and that it's in serious need of a drastic re-boot? Congratulations! This movie is for you! Are you tired of seeing all of those evil\\, white males getting all the screen time\\, wanna see more women and POC? Congratulations! This movie is for you! Do want modern politics injected into your Star Wars? Congratulations! This movie is for you! \\n\\nDid you want answers to all of the questions from The Force Awakens? Too bad! Did you want to watch a good story unfold that paid respect to\\, and continued\\, the stories\/ideas from the previous films? Too bad!  Did you want it to at least make sense? Too bad!\\n\\nThe egregious over use of lens flare in this movie is enough to make me hate it. What everyone else is saying about this movie is true. It's slow\\, nobody and nothing matters\\, there are no stakes\\, it's predictable\\, it cribs numerous scenes from the previous films - it's true. All of it.","true":true}
