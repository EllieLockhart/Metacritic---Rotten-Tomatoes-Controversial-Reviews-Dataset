Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was afraid thst this movie would take characters in the wrong direction but I am very satisfied with the general direction and character development that we see. Its not overly political either which some say but i do not agree. Rian uses the characters invented for episode 7 in a good way and creates a few new\\, great ones\\, and they arent ONLY female or male or diverse just to be diverse. They are absolutely SPOT-ON and thats that. An overall terrific experience for anyone but especially for me as a super-fan of Star Wars!","true":true}
