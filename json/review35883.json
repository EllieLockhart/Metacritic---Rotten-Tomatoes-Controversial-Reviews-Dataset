Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is the first film of the new trilogy that feels as though it isn't entirely relying of the previous films. It doesn't have a horrible lack of character like Rogue One\\, and it doesn't replay a previous film beat for beat like The Force Awakens. Instead\\, it finally feels like a new Star Wars movie. It's engaging\\, fun\\, and fresh\\, all the things necessary to prove that the new trilogy is just that; a new trilogy.","true":true}
