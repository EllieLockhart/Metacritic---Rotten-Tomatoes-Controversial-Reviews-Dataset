Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Walked out feeling lost\\, Rian Johnson complete disrespect of Luke's character & everyone has a punchline was over the top. It's has its moments but much of the movie feels forced. Certain scenarios are dragged out with explanations. TFA I really enjoyed J.J. Abrams new vision something old something new\\, but Johnson leaves just about nothing for Abrams to work with in episode 9. This movie had so much promise yet Johnson's take didn't answer anything in fact made it worse in nearly every way. I now get why stories of Daisy Ridley crying after reading the script & Mark Hamill seeming bitter in the direction Johnson choose to go. And why the cast nearly cheered when J.J. Abrams was announced to take over episode 9!  Johnson tries to reinvent the wheel\\, and fails miserably. If he'd cut down the side stories and Mary Poppins moment and respected Luke's character \\,this could've been a good movie\\, but it's not. The story makes no sense to the connecting the \\nfranchise! Can't wait to see what Robot Chicken does with this ! \\nHonestly I'd rather waited another year or 2 to see it if they'd got it right.  It might take 2 movies to right this ship","true":true}
