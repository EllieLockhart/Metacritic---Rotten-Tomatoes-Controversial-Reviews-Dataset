Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"they decided to ruin luke skywalkers legacy with this stupid simplistic space chase that was way too long for a film where nothing really happens.  The makers of this movie dont even seem to understand what star wars even is and why anyone likes it or used to like it.","true":true}
