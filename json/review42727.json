Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was great. If you weren't into the messages of the film about moving on from the past and stepping into the future then thats too bad. Its not your Star Wars\\, its EVERYONES Star Wars. You dont get to claim ownership of something that belongs to all of us. Rian said it at the end with the shot of that little boy at the end. Its not special people with midiclorians in them that lets you use the force\\, anyone can be a Jedi","true":true}
