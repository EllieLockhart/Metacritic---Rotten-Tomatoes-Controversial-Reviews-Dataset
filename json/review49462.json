Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worth watching\\, visually thrilling\\, action packed... but I have a sneaking suspicion that the story-line was written by a gungan. This felt more like Speed 2 than what I expected from Star Wars.\\n(Also\\, can Hollywood stop being so politically charged? And the obvious critic bias isn't helping.)","true":true}
