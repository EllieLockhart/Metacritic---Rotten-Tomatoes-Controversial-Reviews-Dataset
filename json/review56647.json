Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi's Visually spectacular frames\\, composition and expertly handled special effects attempt to to make up for some questionable decisions within its narrative and is successful to some extent. Just as \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" suffered from recycled plot lines from \\\"A New Hope\\\"\\, The Last Jedi Recycles some aspects from \\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\" but also introduces new ideas and a interesting new exploration of the force that may not sit right with many of the beloved franchises dedicated fans. The fresh ideas that the film introduced did overall deliver a very enjoyable and visually stunning experience from its spectacular motion capture of Andy Serkis as Supreme Leader Snoke\\, to its eye popping space and light saber battle. The film dose boast some flaws such as a strange and unjustified character arc for one of the supporting characters as well as a side plot that takes us to a new planet full of corrupt wealthy characters that feels very unnecessary and almost breaks us away from the established world of the film and nearly becoming dispensable. Nonetheless the Last Jedi is a much more enjoyable experience than it's predecessor and adds to the mythology and vibrant world of Star Wars as an Effective second entry to the new Trilogy.","true":true}
