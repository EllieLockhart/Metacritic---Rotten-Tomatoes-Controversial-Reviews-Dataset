Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Once again\\, hollywood preaches at us and trys to get too cute.  The movie wonders around while it trys to touch on every politically correct theme out there... right down to being a vegetarian. The  treatment of the Chewbacca character changing from being a loyal\\, tough warrior to becoming a muppet is a travesty.  Please kill him off as well so the character development doesnt have to be embarrassed any farther.I guess i need to get used to a bunch of overpaid stars and directors tell me how to live instead of doing what i am paying for\\,\\,\\, good entertainment without the bs  The icing on thw cake- they all are a bunch hypocrites telling us how to think while doing the opposite","true":true}
