Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a fan of the old movies and the next three with Anakin\\, I was so disappointed by the way the minions at Disney really made this movie saga a Joke. I don't wanna go into detail but I guess many other hardcore fans will share my view. \\nOn the other hand\\, newer fans maybe enjoy it since its clearing up at least something. The bright spot was definitely Carrie Fisher\\, Mark Hammil's appearance was also weird and short.","true":true}
