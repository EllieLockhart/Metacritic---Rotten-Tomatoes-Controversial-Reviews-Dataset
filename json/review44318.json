Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many of the political plot elements seemed more descriptive of Disney culture where political correct behavior is forced to prove a point that falls flat.  More specifically the escape sequence.  It was descriptive of a dysfunctional culture more like the Empire\\, errrrr Disney?   I also didn't expect to see Mary Poppins.  The place erupted in laughter including the 12 year old folks next to me.   Finally\\, Luke went through fire to become a mature man (think Obi ...) yet he was made out to be a broken recluse swimming in vain regrets.","true":true}
