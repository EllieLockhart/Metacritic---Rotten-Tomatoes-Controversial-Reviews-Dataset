Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw the originals as a child and understand that NONE of the new movies (PT\\, ST\\, standalones) will ever measure up to that childhood magic. That said\\, I always go into the theater open-minded and have enjoyed every episode of the franchise (although AOTC was a stretch). Rogue One really raised the bar for me as a fan and perhaps that's why I have some issues with the newest installment? I think the late\\, great Irvin Kershner summed up SW writing best\\, \\\"You need humor\\, without gags.\\\" There were entirely too many \\\"gags\\\" which made the first third of the film a little silly. Also a little too much of Disney's political agenda\\, without any real purpose. The middle of the film improved greatly and got to the heart of the saga. The last third of the movie was visually stunning\\, but very choppy and seemed like Disney spent a little too much time puttzing with things in post-production? In fact\\, this has become a noticeable trend in many of the company's franchises as of late. ...but Snoke? Rey's parents? Leia? Still many questions to be answered\\, but not a horrible movie as many have said. I think the \\\"middle act\\\" (i.e. ESB) comparisons and expectations might have also raised the bar a little too high for some\\, but I'll be going back to dig a little deeper. It's was a fun visit to that galaxy far\\, far away!","true":true}
