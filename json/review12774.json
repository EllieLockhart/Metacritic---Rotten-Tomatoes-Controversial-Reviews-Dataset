Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I decided to wait a day and let this film sink in so I could give it a chance to work on me and decide what it was that left such a bad taste in my mouth. I've finally drilled down to what it is:\\n\\nThe magic is gone. Rian Johnson has managed to make a film that is a caricature of a Star Wars film. Almost all the pieces are there\\, though they're outsized in bizarre ways. The piece that is missing is the sense of awe\\, that we're witnessing the beginning or evolution something important.\\n\\nThe easiest way for me to describe this is to compare the film to TFA. TFA had major flaws\\, but JJ managed to strike exactly the right tone in a single scene that\\, in my opinion\\, saved the film: Rey grabbing the lightsaber from Ren in the forest. The look of surprise on her face\\, disbelief on his face\\, the delicate swelling of the music\\, the way JJ chose to frame and hold that moment\\, still makes me shiver. I felt the way I felt when the force guided Luke down the trench during the assault on the Death Star. I felt like something important was happening\\, and the movie asked questions: Why had the force chosen these individuals? To what ends? Could they contain it and use it\\, or would they fall victim to the allure of its power? A new power was rising\\, the mystery was there\\, and there was a sense of awe and promise.\\n\\nIn TLJ\\, the formula is: screw it\\, let's make some money. The point of TLJ isn't the interplay between good and evil on a galactic scale\\, influenced by forces tantalizingly beyond our full control.  The point is how can we create a vehicle that makes the force bigger and more accessible to everyone\\, remove the mystery and moral ambiguity\\, and use that as a vehicle to further commodify the rest of Star Wars. Let's cram the thing with jokes\\, explosions\\, weird aliens\\, and wrap it all in a plot that somehow manages to be droolingly simplistic AND impossible to understand\\, and sell a gazillion tickets. Oh\\, and let's coat the whole thing in a really hackneyed socially progressive sheen that is well meaning but so poorly executed it reeks of artificiality.\\n\\nThe result is a boring movie with a lot of explosions that leaves you wondering the point of it all was. None of the characters progress through any sort of arc. There's never any question what they're going to do\\, because they're cartoonishly simple. Amazingly\\, despite the last-stand situation of the Resistance\\, the stakes feel low\\, because both sides are such bumbling idiots that it's impossible to suspend disbelief and feel like any of it really matters - who would want either of these groups of numbskulls running the galaxy? And the few moments Rian Johnson could have chosen to actually take a chance and really \\\"let the past die\\\" (nice theme man\\, considering you're incapable of committing your own film to it)\\, miraculously\\, the day is saved.\\n\\nA lot of that would have been forgivable if not for this: the movie bungles the few chances it had for redemption. Unlike TFA and other SW films\\, it was unable to find that perfect pitch at the moments where it really mattered. The few times I thought it might\\, the film dropped the ball. The result was a movie that was deeply unsatisfying\\, built by a director who took all the parts out of the Star Wars drawer\\, built a movie with weird bulges of imbalance\\, and totally forgot to add the heart.\\n\\nOne last thing: professional critics\\, you need to check yourselves. This movie had flaws\\, particularly with plot and chronology\\, that indicate seriously sloppy film making. Y'all look like a bunch of shills praising this movie. There are reasons people are asking who is really pulling your strings. And if your reviews are serious\\, your qualifications are seriously\\, seriously dubious.","true":true}
