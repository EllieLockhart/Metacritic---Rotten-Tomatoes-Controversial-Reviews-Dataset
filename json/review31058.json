Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So I decided to see this a second time before making a review and I'm glad I did. We went this time to the 3D IMAX showing and that didn't make much difference but seeing it another time did. The first time I went I felt the movie spent too much time setting up the next one\\, Chapter IX\\, but I see how it all fits together this time. A very good movie with a lot of great CGI and some live action. Maybe a bit too much psycho-babble-religious-mumbo-jumbo\\, but otherwise well done. Only Adam Driver really stands out but everyone else does a credible job. This chapter shows the direction future Star Wars movies will go and it looks terrific. Highly recommended for all the right reasons.","true":true}
