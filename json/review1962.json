Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As much as this has divided fans\\, it came out mostly on top for me. Some really big emotional highs that TFA didn't touch but also some low points that TFA didn't have either. Seeing Yoda back was the best but some of the humor was just misplaced or didn't tonely belong. And Johnson did throw away a lot of the big questions TFA set up\\, which was disappointing. I was ok with the handling of Luke and where Rey is heading tho.","true":true}
