Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson takes Star Wars in a bold new direction\\, successfully creating an epic blockbuster that clears the way for a final chapter that could go anywhere. It contains some of the most memorable and exciting scenes of all the Star Wars films so far\\, however\\, it also contains one scene that weakens the film (one with Leia).","true":true}
