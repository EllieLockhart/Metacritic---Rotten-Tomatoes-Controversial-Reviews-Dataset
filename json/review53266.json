Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Changed my rating to one star since half stars don't count.\\n\\nThis is a terrible addition to Star Wars. It wasted the potential of the characters introduced in the force awakens. It didn't answer any questions of fulfill any basic expectations. The side plot on canto bight was very boring\\, and unnecessary. It introduced some very unlikable characters like admiral holdo who was a stuck up\\, egocentric jerk who has no clue what she's doing\\, yet she's supposed to be the hero who is teaching poe a lesson.  And rose\\, who is a confusing mess. She kills herself to stop finn from sacrificing himself for the resistance\\, by almost killing finn. On top of it all\\, this is the most divisive movie yet. Star wars used to bring people together on common ground. It was something everyone could enjoy. But now it blatantly makes social justice politics central to the story. Whether you agree with it or not\\, it effectively alienates a large portion of it's viewers. How about you focus on writing compelling\\, relatable\\, and likeable characters with good story arcs rather than focusing on how divisive you can make the movie\\, disney?","true":true}
