Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would give it 0 if I could. The plot made no sense. The characters are dumb and anything from the originals is completely negated and made irrelevant. The dumbest character has to be Rose. Rose destroys a scene tat may have actually been a good scene by intercepting Finn as he is about to sacrifice himself to save the rebellion. Instead she crashes into him risking both their lives and says \\\"That's how will win by saving what we love not destroying what we hate\\\". Meanwhile the empire (because that's what it is let's be real) fires it's death canon at the rebel base.","true":true}
