Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I agree it's good to let the old things die\\, but the new things need to explore some kind of essential truth to feel meaningful.  One dimensional characters\\, terrible plot holes... this Disneyfied sci-fi film doesn't come anywhere close to accomplishing anything of value.  While having some beautiful visuals\\, there's a case to be made that it's the worst Star Wars film ever.","true":true}
