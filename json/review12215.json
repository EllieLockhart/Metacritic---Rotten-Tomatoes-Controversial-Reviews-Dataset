Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am giving 1-star for the visual effects. It is a beautiful film. \\nI am taking 4-stars for the writing\\, director\\, and everything else. This is one of the worst Star Wars movies in the franchise. I have no idea what the critics are talking about\\, aside from getting side money from Disney pimping them or something. Everything here is pretty unrealistic. I just want to enjoy the movie\\, but there are many instances where the stupidity of the whole thing takes you out of the experience. Without spoiling it\\, the director did a HORRIBLE job. If you saw The Force Awakens\\, and expect the same quality of storytelling and character development\\, you will be sorely disappointed. Everything was thrown out. And every character seems to be written for an SNL skit\\, or someone who does not know what the f**k they were doing. Cringey moments\\, stupid plot lines\\, all leading up to NOTHING. It was the worst movie I have seen in 2017. THIS is the movie that will ruin the Star Wars franchise. I am NO LONGER supporting or looking forward to anything STAR WARS related and frankly\\, it made me HATE Disney.","true":true}
