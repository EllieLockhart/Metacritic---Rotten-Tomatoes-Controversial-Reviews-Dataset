Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"aLL IN ALL THE WORST STAR WARS FILM EVER MADE. NOT ONLY DOES IT MISHANDLE THE LEGACY CHARACTERS\\, IT FAILS TO BUILD ANY MEANING FULL MOTIVATIONS FOR THE NEW CHARACTERS WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO CARRY THIS FRANCHISE FOREWORD. THE BEST THING I CAN SAY ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS THAT IT LOOKS GOOD\\, BUT THEN EVERY STAR WARS MOVIE LOOKS GOOD.","true":true}
