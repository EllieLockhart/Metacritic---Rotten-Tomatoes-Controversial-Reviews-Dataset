Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars TLJ takes the saga down an entirely new direction that can be off putting for some but refreshing for others. Everyone sees this film differently but it opens up new doors and directions for the star wars universe and its characters","true":true}
