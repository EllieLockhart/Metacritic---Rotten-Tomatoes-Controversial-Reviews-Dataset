Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked the Force Awakened\\, but I did not like the Last Jedi. Mark Hamill did an great job and it was fantastic to see Luke Skywalker again. I think disney really fucked this one up for the fans and ruined a great character's legacy. I think Disney ruined the legacy of this character and I am really disappointed in what I watched. This was a turn off for me and the Star Wars Universe.","true":true}
