Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At this point even the greatest shills have to admit that beyond its SJW fassade\\, the last jedi is nothing more than a visually stunning hit piece on everything that was Star Wars. \\n\\nBeloved characters got humiliated and are wasted in a sub-par storyline full of plot holes and ideologically driven events.\\n\\nThis movie is not just a disaster by itself\\, but a disaaster to the overall franchise. The subsequent box office disaster of Solo says it all.\\n\\nStar Wars is in big trouble and Episode IX is unlikely to save it.\\n\\nThe Star Wars franchise now\\, sadly\\, needs a reset to have fightimg chance to heal and get back on its feet.\\n\\nShame on the people responsible for this mess at Lucasfilm and Disney.","true":true}
