Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi answers the big questions from The Force Awakens and gives  us the best ever written Star Wars. This film is very detail orientated. Blink and you'll miss tiny things. BTW One of the reviews asked about the map. Try watching the films. It helps to know what you're talking about.","true":true}
