Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely terrible movie.  It's obvious that the \\\"Critics\\\" portion of Rotten Tomatoes cannot be trusted\\, and is paid.\\nThere is no way people can say they love this film\\, there is nothing good about it at all.","true":true}
