Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Okay\\, tirade time:\\nIt was horrible\\, chiefly the really badly pitched Avengers-style humour. Right from the off\\, the 'comedy' made me squirm. It's not like Star Wars isn't funny in places\\, but this was so self-consciously knowing it felt totally awkward. Cheesy slapstick\\, expectation-breaking behaviour\\, numerous hilaaaaarious new merchandise-shifting creatures\\, nods to the 'good old days' that might as well have been delivered with a wink into camera (a joke about Leia's old hairstyle? Really?!)\\, and I don't ever want to be reminded of the corniest\\, most out-of-place move Luke Skywalker pulls in the final battle that made me want to gouge my eyes out - you'll know it when you see it. There are completely pointless characters with nothing to make you care about them or to understand why they're doing what they're doing (Snoke\\, anyone?); there's swearing(!)\\, admittedly very mild swearing\\, but that's not what Star Wars does; references to God (\\\"God speed\\\" a couple of characters say to one another\\, even though there's never been any explicit mention of a 'God' in any of the previous films). To be honest\\, all of the dialogue was way too contemporary\\, there were plot holes big enough to fly an Imperial Battle Cruiser through\\, nobody said \\\"I've got a bad feeling about this\\\"\\, Princess Leia now has superpowers (proving as unexpected as when R2-D2 could suddenly fly in Episode II)\\, the effects and sets looked cheap\\, but worst of all - and this is the kicker for me - it didn't feel like Star Wars\\, it felt like Disney's Star Wars. Adam Driver was ace\\, though\\, so there is that.","true":true}
