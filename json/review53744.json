Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good movie. Really enjoyed the plot twists. Different enough from the other Star wars movies to actually be enjoyable and feel fresh. A couple of plot issues were certainly there.... But hey\\, nothing is perfect and the story continues to the next generation. Can't understand the bad ratings. Good Star wars movie!!!! But then I like all the Star wars movies. Well\\, the prequels weren't the greatest. Thank God these 3 episodes are shaping up nicely.","true":true}
