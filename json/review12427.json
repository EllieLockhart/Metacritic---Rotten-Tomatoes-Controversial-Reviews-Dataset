Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can appreciate Johnson's desire to subvert viewer expectations and push the limits as a filmmaker\\, but\\, the way he handled characters who have 40 years of history was very poor. It was sad to see characters such as Luke Skywalker spend their entire last film denying everything that they stood for. It was sad and I feel bad for Mark Hamill and I feel bad for JJ Abrams. It is as if Rian Johnson does not understand how a trilogy works\\, he pretty much made the greater third act in the middle\\, while some may call that bold it just feels like an arrogant filmmaker doing whatever the hell he wants regardless of it's impact and all the narrative work and preparation that went in to breathing life into this franchise again. I honestly can not understand why critics are giving this film such high ratings. \\n\\nRian Johnson's skills as a filmmaker are undeniable and would be very much well suited to kick-off the new generation of Jedi with a separate trilogy... BUT HE SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN GIVEN CONTROL OF BRINGING THE SKYWALKER SAGA TO A CLOSE.","true":true}
