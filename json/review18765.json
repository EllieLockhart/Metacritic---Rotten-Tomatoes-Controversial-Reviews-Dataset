Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a great movie.  If you didn't like it that's ok too\\, maybe just don't go out of your way to influence people's opinions.  Let them see the film (or not) and have their genuine opinion on it.  This BOT thing is really pathetic no matter how you look at it.  It might be Star Wars\\, but it's still just a movie.","true":true}
