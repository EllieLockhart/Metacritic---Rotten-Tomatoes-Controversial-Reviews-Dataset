Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I won't lie. The movie\\, as a film\\, was entertaining. Over time\\, however\\, I started to hate the movie more and more as I thought about how it fit into the SW universe. It doesn't. It doesn't fit at all. It should have been a new SciFi movie rather than Star Wars. Star Wars has an existing canon and universe which\\, even after Disney wiped the canonical slate\\, has its own rules\\, history\\, and expectations. Yet\\, even the movie is self-aware that it is trying to erase the established saga that has existed over generations. They literally say\\, \\\"Let the past die.\\\" We came to this movie because of the past\\, because of its history. Why did they not just start from scratch and build a new franchise\\, rather than murder an existing one? Many people\\, myself included\\, have lost out hope for the future of the franchise\\, and have even chosen not to go see the next one because the canon is now beyond redemption.\\n\\nThis is made all the more potent when you consider the American politics that sneak their way into this film. Disney\\, we do not like it when movies are used as vehicles for political promotion. Star Wars has always been about good vs evil. Why do you so readily want to blur that line? You have dated this movie\\, and have removed any chance of it becoming a classic by your luck for propaganda. I have all the movies on DVD\\, but I will not buy this one. You have destroyed my love for Star Wars and murdered my hero\\, Luke Skywalker\\, replacing him with a bitter\\, depressed\\, spiteful old man. And SPOILERS\\, just when Luke starts to act like Luke again\\, you kill him again! \\n\\nThe only hope you have in redeeming yourself is remaking Episode VIII with a better plot before you proceed to Ep IX\\, but you won't because you don't care about the fans of the franchise\\, as long as you got your money. For shame.","true":true}
