Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like all the others have eruditely analysed\\, I'll admit I'm too lazy to type. Suffice to say the SJW\\, pathetic narrative tangents and disrespect to the lore and saga continuity is a sad indictment to an amazing opportunity lost.\\n\\nRJ and KK get different jobs NOW.","true":true}
