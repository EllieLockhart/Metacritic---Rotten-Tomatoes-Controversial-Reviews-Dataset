Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing. As is more common in crappy romcoms than Star Wars movies\\, the plot hinged on a lot of characters failing to communicate or acting in ways totally counter to their prior characterization. Ben murders a bunch of his childhood friends and goes to the dark side because he misunderstands Luke's intentions\\, Poe sends Finn+Rose on a suicide mission and organizes a mutiny because the Rebels don't communicate with each other\\, Rey walks into Snoke's trap because Luke doesn't tell her anything about how the force can be used to mislead...it gets very frustrating! \\n\\nI know this is kind of a \\\"state of all franchises in the 21st century\\\" complaint and I've grown to expect some of this\\, but I have to say also that the merchandising was especially distracting in this installment - every other scene featured a new cute alien species or a new stormtrooper costume or a slight modification to an existing weapon\/craft for LEGO to market a set around or Disneyland to base their new Star Wars land on. Even a lot of the action sequences seemed conveniently adaptable into theme park rides (that Casino planet escape especially).","true":true}
