Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was really hoping for something closer to Rogue One or Empire Strikes Back.  Instead I got Rubber fish and chickens\\, Leia flying through space (Smelly feet bad cheese)\\, and a washed up Luke Skywalker.  This will go down as the worst Star Wars movie of all time.  Hell\\, this movie makes the original trilogy\\, Jar Jar Binks and all\\, more desirable.  Why can't we get gritty again ala Rogue One\\, Empire Strikes Back\\, and even the Force Awakens.  Leave the Mickey Mouse shit for the cartoons and quit F***ing with the trilogies.  Stop trying so hard to get laughs and let them come from the situations the characters find themselves in.  I loved Looper and had great hopes for this film when I heard Rian Johnson was slated to Direct\\, but in the end it seemed like he was kept on too tight a leash.","true":true}
