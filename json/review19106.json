{"101487":142882,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2019-11-22","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's hard to overstate just how incredibly disappointing this movie was. While the Last Jedi was far from perfect\\, it set up the new trilogy nicely by introducing compelling new characters and leaving you with plot mysteries that were genuinely enticing and left the audience wanting to know the answers. Instead of building on the development of these new characters (with the exception of Kylo and Rey) and plot mysteries (Rey's parentage\\, Snoke's origins)\\, Rian Johnson seems to actively go out of his way to spit in the face of fans and subvert the fanbase's expectations. Instead of more character development\\, we see screen time hogged by the newly introduced Rose Tico and Admiral Holdo\\, whose lack of character depth is matched only by their genuine cringeyness and unlikeability. In fact\\, in what had the potential to be the only compelling moment in the film for Finn\\, Rose Tico literally smashes her way into the scene and delivers the least deserved kiss in cinematic history. Instead of the answers to the compelling plot mysteries\\, Rian Johnson instead unceremoniously dismisses both in a matter of minutes when Snoke dies with no explanation at all of his origins or his connections to characters like Luke and Palpatine\\, and Rey's parentage is outright dismissed.\\n\\nI loved Rian Johnson's Looper\\, but he is just not fit to make Star Wars movies and it is so disappointing that he completely and intentionally derailed the abundant potential of this trilogy in some sort of edgy\\, artistic statement. Just read between the lines of what Mark Hamill and Andy Serkis and JJ Abrams have said about this film\\, none of them like the direction it went.\\n\\nI will not be posting spoilers here\\, but I will tell you I have read the verified leaked plot of episode IX\\, and it makes this movie seem even worse in hindsight. The threads between episodes VII and IX are there and tangible\\, and if the connecting movie had been even somewhat competently made\\, we would easily have a trilogy that surpasses the prequels. It is just mind boggling that Disney allowed Rian Johnson to throw such a massive wrench in the story of this trilogy with absolutely no heed being paid to episodes VII or IX and essentially the plot to thread water for two and a half hours\\, which inevitably led them to bringing JJ Abrams back in an attempt to rescue the trilogy. Completely ignoring important plot points isn't a plot twist Rian\\, it's lazy writing and it's an insult to the fans. One is left wondering how Disney did not go into this trilogy with a concrete storyline set for the directors to follow. Even a minimal amount of overall story planning (or just having the same director for all three movies) could have made this trilogy great\\, and instead we're sitting here hoping that Abrams can somehow tie it all together in under three hours while still advancing the plot. It is truly a tragedy that Abrams did not get to direct this whole trilogy.\\n\\nIt is promising that The Mandalorian and Fallen Order have solid plots and appear well made\\, but at the same time they comparatively make this trainwreck of a film stand out even more. The Last Jedi is a black-eye on the Star Wars canon that greatly surpasses even the oft-maligned Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones in its disappointment and makes the latter two films seem practically great by comparison. Rian Johnson should be ashamed of himself and not allowed within a parsec of this franchise ever again.\\n\\nHelp us JJ Abrams\\, you're our only hope...","true":true}
