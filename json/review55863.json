Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Quite frankly one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  This is on a 'Freddy Got Fingsred' level  of bad.  The forced comedy that is not organic to the universe is off putting from the get-go.  The cumbersome and awkward dialogue makes Episode II look like 'Casablanca' or 'When Harry Met Sally'\\, which is almost unthinkable for anyone who has watched that dumpster fire more than. 10 times and broken it down.  The new characters (Benicio del Toro\\, Laura Dern\\, and Kelly Marie Tran) are under-developed\\, under-utilized\\, and unfortunately costumed and directed.  It is unfortunate too given that I have loved everything I have previously seen out of Dern and del Toro.  Additionally\\, elegant and respectful opportunities were available to deal with Carrie Fisher's untimely passing and we're not taken; this will  create unnecessary challenges for the next saga film.  Lastly\\, the movie provided no satisfactory pay-offs for the exposition in Episode 7\\, seemed to point the finger and say 'gotcha' at the audience multiple times to no real effect\\, and lastly didn't take advantage of any of the storytelling opportunities Mark Hamil\\, who really delivered from a shear performance perspective  afforded.  This was a low caliber\\, forgettable\\, dijointed sci fi movie.  I will not be seeing this again\\, and wish I could have donated the money I paid to see this to charity.","true":true}
