Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible.  If you love star wars and know the lore\\, you will hate this movie. It successfully  spits in the face of old characters and fans. This money grab film filled with bad jokes\\, major plot holes\\, and an \\\" I can make it bigger while destroying the old\\\" attitude is not worth your time. I want my money and time back. Valarian was much better than the garbage they put on film.","true":true}
