Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some great visuals and great performances by the very capable actors. However\\, too long\\, boring\\, poorly paced. The B and C storylines needed to be scaled way back with whole characters that were unnecessarily introduced. Cool additions to the mythology still don't make up for the lack character development or incredibly lame plot. I personally don't understand how such a long and overstuffed film can make the Galaxy far far away feel so small. I'm going to stick with the Original Trilogy from now on.","true":true}
