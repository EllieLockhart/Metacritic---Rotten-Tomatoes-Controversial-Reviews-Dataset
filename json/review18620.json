Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It may be less polished than Abrams' remake of A New Hope\\, but for once - in my lifetime at least - Star Wars has been honoured with a script that says something\\, with characters that are deeply flawed and complex\\, and at last with a film that hasn't been ruthlessly pressed into a corporate product\\, developed to please the hoards of consumers with gleaming effects and fast-paced action; it's far greater than that. The Last Jedi felt worlds closer to being a real movie than The Force Awakens and it has given me hope for the future\\, I am glad that Disney is investing in this.
