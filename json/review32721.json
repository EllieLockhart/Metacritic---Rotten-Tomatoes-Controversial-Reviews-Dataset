Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi - (NON-SPOILER) This absolutely is the Star Wars you're looking for. \\n\\nWith so many iconic characters in this franchise\\, it's difficult to dedicate the right amount of time to each of them. Rian Johnson knocks this challenge out of the park. Each of your favorite characters get fleshed out more than in any other previous installment. If you thought you knew them already\\, just you wait.\\n\\nDaisy Ridley and Adam Driver give so much to their roles in this film. The writing is the best it's been since Empire\\, and they do not put it to waste. Each of their motivations are well-defined and believable\\, making their journey that much more engaging to watch.\\n\\nThis installment has the longest runtime of any prior Star Wars movie at 2h 33m\\, and does have a slower pace than the others. That's not to say it feels like the senate hearings of the prequels\\, it just takes its time in building the story. That patience in storytelling makes the eventual grand moments all the more impressive.\\n\\nAnd can we talk about the Porgs? If I was nervous about anything going into this movie\\, it was that we were going to have a new Jar Jar on our hands with these things. My fears were unfounded\\, however\\, and I now need to get my hands on all things Porgs. If they're sold out\\, a baker's dozen of the crystal foxes will more than suffice.\\n\\nI could say that The Last Jedi is 'Impressive; most impressive' or the old standby that 'The force is strong with this one.' Instead\\, I'll tell you that it's the best of the new films\\, and cracks my top 3 Star Wars movies of all time. I've said it before\\, and I hope to say it again: this is an amazing time to be a Star Wars fan.","true":true}
