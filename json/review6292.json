Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney\\, Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson took a steaming dump on \\\"Fanboys\\\".  The people whose support and money made Star Wars a franchise of note.\\n\\nDisney - I assume they're only interest is merchandising and don't care about the product.  You can see that in everything they touch.  Disney used to be the stamp of quality; it is now the Kiss of Death.\\n\\nK. Kennedy - this waste of skin stated upfront that she was going to ignore the people who made this a thing she covets.  She lifted her skirt and defected on everyone....Male.  \\n\\nRian-  A child who painted a pretty picture\\, that has no depth\\, soul.\\n\\nOne of the things that made me a fan of Star Wars and Star Trek (not the Kelvin Universe version) is strong women of substance\\, lots of non-whites (like me) doing things of value and purpose.\\n\\nThis movie is nasty and diminishes everyone\\, men\\, ethnic groups and especially women.  Goddass Purple Hair lording it over everyone\\, treating them as if they were brainless peons\\, keeping secrets for NO reason\\, and if you have a penis\\, then she makes it clear that THOSE are untrustworthy\\, erratic\\, stupid and untrustworthy.\\n\\nFinn is scenery until finally he is going to do something noble and Rose Cucks him because in Kennedy's universe\\, not even a black man can have worth or do something for the greater good.\\n\\nLet's not talk about The Flying Nun and the lack of explosive decompression when she\\, the ONLY force sensitive person to defeat space comes back.\\n\\nThe fact that the New Order is nothing but stupid people who cannot call for reinforcements.\\n\\nRose - I liked this character at first and really had some high hopes\\, maybe a story about the medallion that her sister(?) the bomber had...nada.  Well\\, at least I saved the animals.\\n\\nWhich brings me to the swiss cheese plotline and storyline.  The Casino thing was a throw away.\\n\\nThe whole object of going there was pure artifice and WOULDN'T have happened if Dern of the Purple Order of a Stick Up The Bum had just let them know what the deal was.\\n\\nRay was good\\, but they totally ruined her character by pushing the Mary Sue bit so far\\, it puked on the whole concept that made Jedi\\, Sith and the Force (which has now been co-opted as a \\\"woman\\\"\\, Not happy with the world\\, Feminists are now elbowing in their way into metaphysics) what made Star Wars such a great pass-time.\\n\\nKennedy threw down the gauntlet of disdain and petulant revenge\\, and Disney and Rian were willing sock puppets.\\n\\nI will never go see a Rian movie or anything that has Kennedy behind it.  And fuck you Laura Dern for pretending you are some pioneer of femininity.  You should kiss Uhuras\\, Janeways\\, and Leia's ass\\, instead of posing.  They were the pioneers\\, and Leia killed Jabba and his posse in a goddamned bikini\\, blew up his ship and smoked the fuck outta everyone while you were in diapers.\\n\\nI won't get into Luke\\, No Answers to ANYTHING that had been set up\\, or the inexplicable rise of the New Order with the Space Balls running things.\\n\\nSnoke?  Why was he even there?","true":true}
