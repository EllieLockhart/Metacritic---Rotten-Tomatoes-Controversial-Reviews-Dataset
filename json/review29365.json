Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson did what not even Jar Jar Binks could do -- ruin a wonderful franchise. Its like he had never actually seen or read a previous Star Wars installment. Can't believe that after the entertaining Force Awakens and Rogue One installments\\, Disney would sanction this moron's deconstruction of everything fans hold dear. Ugh.","true":true}
