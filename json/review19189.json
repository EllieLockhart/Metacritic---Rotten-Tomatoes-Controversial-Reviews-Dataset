Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"it's like eating a piece of shit without knowing it. Since it's made by a great cook\\, you don't notice and it tastes ok (still shit...) and then you learn you ate shit... and you don't know what to think! that's the way I felt when I got out of the theater. loved the pew pew\\, but desapointed about everything else :(","true":true}
