Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"watch \\\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi - RANT COMPILATION REVIEW\\\" on YouTube.\\n\\nMen\\, women\\, girls\\, black people\\, asian people\\, feminists\\, EVERYONE SAYS THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE.\\n\\nReality check\\, Rian Johnson.\\nReality check\\, Kathleen Kennedy.\\n\\nYou both will get a nasty call from Disney.
