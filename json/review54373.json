Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have three main issues with this movie.\\n1. The scenes in the first half of the movie were very choppy and didn't flow together as well as they should have. I found it hard to follow because of this.\\n2. New characters didn't get the character development they needed.\\n3. The Rose and Finn storyline was stupid. I understand why they needed that storyline but because they didn't give Rose proper character development\\, I found there little storyline boring and just not what it should have been.\\n\\nI found that the first half of The Last Jedi just didn't feel like Star Wars.\\nThis being said\\, the second half was fantastic. For the entire second half of the movie I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. I couldn't take my eyes off the movie screen. The second half of The Last Jedi felt like Star Wars. I was constantly asking myself what's going to happen because it was just so unpredictable.\\n\\nIn conclusion\\, the first half of The Last Jedi wasn't anything special. While watching the first half I could really see why this movie isn't getting great reviews. But the moment the second half started I was shocked that the movie is getting the reviews it's getting. The second half allowed me to forget about the average first half and appreciate the movie for what it was.\\n\\nOverall this movie is a 8.5\/10","true":true}
