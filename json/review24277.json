{"101487":153765,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mess. I have been a Star Wars fan since I was kid. I'd say 25 years because I was around 6 when I first watched A New Hope on VHS. I can't describe how disappointed and angry I felt when I left the theater after my first viewing of The Last Jedi. Please note that I am not the only person who feels this way. When a large segment of the fans feel outraged after seeing your movie there is a problem\\, Disney\\, a gross miscalculation. Rian Johnson's treatment of Star Wars is the equivalent of graffiti on a statue. It feels as if it is intentionally disrespecting fans and what they love of the OT and PT (yes\\, there are people who love the PT). \\n\\nI've heard people say that whoever didn't love this movie is just upset because things didn't play out the way they wanted. In my case\\, that's false. I didn't have a list of required developments and arcs. All I wanted was a movie that didn't feel like a slap in the face but apparently that is too much to ask. Incidentally\\, I liked the dynamic between Rey and Kylo Ren\\, and especially enjoyed Kylo's arc and Adam Driver's acting. But the way that Rian Johnson torched the past to make way for his version of Star Wars is gross. It feels like it was deliberately made to rattle and upset people. \\n\\n[SPOILERS] There's so much that's messed up about what goes on in this movie\\, from tossing the lightsaber and then breaking it\\, killing Admiral Ackbar\\, Mary Poppins Leia\\, Luke's deranged persona complete with predilection for those creepy udders\\, Snoke being disposed of in that way\\, Rey's parentage reveal\\, etc. etc. It's like a big F.U. to whoever was remotely invested in this.\\n\\nBeyond that\\, the movie itself is just bad. The pacing and editing looks like it could have been done by a noob\\, the humor is preposterous and disruptive of tone\\, the characterizations are awful and flimsy\\, especially Rey's and Luke's. The Canto Bight plot is pointless and BroomBoi is corny AF. It feels like it was made to deliver one big shock after the other\\, but without any substance to back it up the only shock for me is how this guy got a trilogy. I promise I will not be watching it. I go to the movies to enjoy myself\\, not to get trolled. At this point I'm not even sure I'll watch episode 9 and coming from a lifelong fan of Star Wars that is saying a lot.","true":true}
