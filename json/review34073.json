Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terribly disappointed. The Force Awaken had much promise which was laid waste by The Last Jedi. Too much plot holes\\, stunted comedy and legacy Star Wars magic which was completely destroyed by this movie. This movie seems like Spaceballs version of The Force Awakens and Rogue One. I am going to abandon the Star Wars franchise from now on.","true":true}
