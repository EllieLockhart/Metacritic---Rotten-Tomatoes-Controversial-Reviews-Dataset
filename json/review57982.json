Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where do I even begin? This movie is just a giant turd sandwich. I love Star Wars... And I always have\\, but this movie destroys the entire essence of Star Wars. I understand trying to shake up the formula a bit\\, but to stray from all the lore of the previous films\\, on top of zero character development just made this film a Michael Bay movie that happened to have lightsabers. Disney... Listen to your core Star Wars fans. Don't turn this franchise into a crappy Marvel superhero movie with bad jokes. I fear there is no saving this trilogy.... And heaven help me if they still give Rian Johnson his own trilogy after this giant piece of garbage. This is the Star Wars movie no true Star Wars fan asked for.... And a Star Wars movie for people that aren't really Start Wars fans.","true":true}
