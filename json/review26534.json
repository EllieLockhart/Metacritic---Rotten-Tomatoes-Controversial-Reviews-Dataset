Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Oh boy. It's very risky. It's filled with surprises. It will turn off many people who aren't ready for something like this. In the end result\\, I enjoyed the hell out of this exciting and emotional journey\\, filled with characters full of depth; I'm glad to say we're in new territories.","true":true}
