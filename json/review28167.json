Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poor editing leads to a chaotic narrative that could have been something at least good. Instead\\, we have b-roll footage and an attempt at Galaxy building that ultimately makes this universe a bit smaller and unimaginitive. It's not the worst Star Wars movie\\, but it most certainly is not the best. This feels\\, looks\\, and plays out like a big budget syfy show. Perhaps they should have presented it this way","true":true}
