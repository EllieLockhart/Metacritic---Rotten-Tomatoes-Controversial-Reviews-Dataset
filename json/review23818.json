Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"luke was undermined. This film was a terrible installment if Ryan johnson is reading this go to hell for ruiining star wars. i cant describe how much of a monmstrosity this is. you mutilated the force and the jedi and the wholre universe in general. Rogue One was ana amazing movie. Shoot Rian Johnson should take lessons from Revenge of the Sith.","true":true}
