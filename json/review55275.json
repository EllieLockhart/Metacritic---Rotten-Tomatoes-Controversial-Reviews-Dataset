Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Laughably bad and definitely the worst movie in the saga. The Last Jedi has some great visuals and some jokes that really work\\, but that's it. Rian Johnson's writing is cringeworthy and makes me question if he's even a Star Wars fan. This movie has ruined future Star Wars movies for me because I am no longer interested in finding out what happens next.","true":true}
