Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I normally just look at the reviews of movies on this site and use them to determine if I want to spend my money. This movie is so bad\\, so disappointing that I felt compelled to offer an opinion just to save someone like me out there from wasting the money. Every negative review I have read about this movie is correct. It sacrifices all of the elements that made the original series great to promote political correctness with threadbare characters and terrible inconsistences that your teenager can rattle off to you. Only by denying DISNEY(r) huge profits from ticket and merchandise sales can\\, we the fans\\, try to get the message across.","true":true}
