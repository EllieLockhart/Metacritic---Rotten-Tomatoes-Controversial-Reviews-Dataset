Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(NO SPOILERS FOR THE LAST JEDI) From the Force Awakens all we got was Luke Skywalker turning around\\, and looking at Rey surprised and it cuts to the credits. In Star Wars The Last Jedi\\, we see a lot of the answers we looked for and since J.J. never gave any ground rules for the characters\\, and left it all to guess work\\, Rian had a lot to work with and I believe that Rian did an excellent job at bringing in character stories. Taking risks and making a fresh story\\, which was one of the biggest complaints of The Force Awakens. I enjoyed the movie\\, the story was simply out of this world\\, although I can understand why some hate it\\, I on the other hand loved the story. We really have absolutely no idea where the characters are going\\, and in one movie you can only give so many back stories\\, and we still have episode 9 to conclude and perhaps shed light on many unanswered questions. Tons of exciting action\\, and unlike previous films the Last Jedi without spoiling anything makes you feel that no character is safe. They could always make prequels and stories for these characters in the future as well.","true":true}
