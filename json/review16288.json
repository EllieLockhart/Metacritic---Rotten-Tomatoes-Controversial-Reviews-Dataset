Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not interested in the social issues of the day being forced into an iconic fantasy franchise.  There are plenty of other movies that can be made to push that agenda.  Leave my Sci-Fi fantasy what it is meant to be.  fantasy entertainment.  In addition the story line is so ridiculous\\, disjointed\\, inconsistent and just plain stupid to believe.  What a disaster!.  All the women are heroes based on the idiocy of the males.  Yup\\, that's the way to tell a story.  Mary Poppins Leah.yup\\, that makes sense.  Kill off iconic characters in disrespectful ways?  Yup\\, that's a winning formula.  Make Rose a crazy ideological stalker chick?  yup\\, I can relate to that.  Admiral Holdo an aging bitter man hating shrew?  Sounds reasonable. Poe is an irresponsible flyboy?  Not in the last movie?  Finn is an unimportant leaky bag of fluid?  Not very funny at all.  rey is the new Mary Jane nobody who can defeat anybody w\/o training?  Of Course!!!  Phasma gets virtually no screen time and gets sucked through the floor?  Absolutely!  We can't have any evil female characters.  Girls good\\, men bad Grunt Grunt Grunt.Why wouldn't she?  Completely violates and disrespects all these characters story lines.","true":true}
