Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At least it was sort of original? Other than that...story is hoaky\\, dialogue is abysmal\\, most of the acting seemed lazy and dispassionate\\, somehow felt both rushed and slow at the same time\\, timeline makes no sense\\, way overdone CGI\\, and more annoying things that just don't make sense (why do energy cannons show a clear parabolic arc\\, much less in space?).","true":true}
