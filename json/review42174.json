Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie script should be given to college students as an example of how NOT to write a story.  I enjoy all the fake paid reviews.  They say the same things \\\"Knocked one of the park!\\\"  \\\"Star wars is taking in a bold new direction!\\\"  Please\\, only naive people believe in the fluff reviews.  The audience is fair in saying it deserves a 44%.  I believe that should be lower\\, but money buys votes.","true":true}
