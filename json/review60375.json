Okay here is where some people might end up not liking some decisions.  All I will say is I was very emotionally invested and loved the first game.  I finished the game with tears in my eyes and was clapping.  It was phenomenal.  I never read any leaks so it all hit me as I played the game.  Some parts are predictable obviously and I went in thinking I would be critical of this and not like it.  Turns out the end had a better pay off for me than even the first.   It will be an instant generational classic that will be talked about for a long time.Ignore the fake hate the game is getting\\, go buy it and enjoy.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
