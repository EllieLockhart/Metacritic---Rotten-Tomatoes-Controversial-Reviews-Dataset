Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney destroyed Star Wars and I have signed up to Rotten Tomatoes (RT) just to comment on this film. I fully agree with a large majority of the negative comments posted on RT. They are all true\\, that 50% scored by the audience it's going to keep dropping even more because this movie really sucked. The general story is very weak\\, with many more holes added and no correlation whatsoever with TFA\\, plus the excessive misplaced humor is borderline stupid. Now\\, what I am furious the most is what Disney and Rian Johnson did with Luke Skywalker. They've decided to portrayed him as a grumpy\\, old\\, Master Jedi that cowardly tries to kill people in their sleep!!! WTF man!! If they are Ok with that\\, then they never understood Star Wars in the first place. However\\, by all means\\, go to the theater and watch the movie. If you are a SW fan\\, please go and you will understand why the audience ratings from other TRUE FANS are so low for this junk. At the end\\, you will feel the same as I did\\, which was betrayed\\, robbed and extremely uninterested on what's going to happen with any of the characters on episode IX. Disney destroyed SW because all they cared was to make money. Guess what\\, the next movie will tank in the box office.","true":true}
