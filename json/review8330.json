Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Felt a huge disconnect between the previous movie and this one. The dialogue between the characters had no sustenance and fell flat due to unoriginal content pulled from children's movies. Characters who once shined in episode 7 became dull and annoying in episode 8. The plot was extremely rushed and in the end we are left in the same location where we were at the end of episode 7. I believe it would be best if the director didn't write the next film for the sake of the franchise.","true":true}
