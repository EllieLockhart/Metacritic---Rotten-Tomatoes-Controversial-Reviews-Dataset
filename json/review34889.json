Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film brought you to the edge of you seat with the twists and turns. My heart raced in anticipation of what was about to happen. The movie is long but doesn't feel like it\\, in fact it seems short.  I think it seems short because the story arcs could have been longer. Those \\nstory arc destinations are compelling\\, visually stunning and characters are intriguing in the film leaving you wanting to see more and discover more.  Details of this are hard as they give away the story line. The surprises and twist of story are why\/what this movie is great. The only down side for me was comedy at times seems a little Forced or unnecessary.  However as I write this I think they just wanted to feel different then Rouge one\\, but that just speculation. G hey succeeded and created a Movie that isn't a rehashed copied story line from the Originals\\, one that I and my children will see again and again.","true":true}
