Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Starwars movie ever made. Not only is it pointless but it undoes and spits on anything that the original trilogy and characters stood for. It destroys Luke Skywalker and everything he stood and fought for. It's a malicious movie which disrespects the joy\\, adventure and fun of any of the previous movies (especially the OT). This is the only Starwars movie that I walked out of hating it.","true":true}
