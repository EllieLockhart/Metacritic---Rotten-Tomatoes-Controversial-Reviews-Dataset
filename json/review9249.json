Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Garbage movie. Bad acting\\, bad writing\\, bad diolge in general. There are entire scenes that add nothing to the plot and every other line is a stupid quippy joke that seems way to cringey and half baked. They could have cut an hour and a half out of this movie and it would have made more sense.\\nIt feels like whoever was in charge of this one wanted to completely change star wars into something unrecognizable and unwanted.  The effects were cool though","true":true}
