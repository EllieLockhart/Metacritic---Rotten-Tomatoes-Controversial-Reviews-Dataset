Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Why\\, everything we loved about Star Wars has been ruined with money\\, the story is lacking\\, with many plot holes\\, the characters are inconsiderate and unpredictable\\, constantly making irrational decisions. Luke has been destroyed as a character. Any story arcs potentially set up by JJ Abrams has been erased\\, resulting in a jumpy story. New\\, exciting characters which had so much potential as side stories\\, have been wasted. This is a total failure. ","true":true}
