The graphics are amazing they\u2019re realistic and everything about the game is visually stunning. The mechanics are an improvement from the first game but tries to stay loyal with the previous mechanic system used in the first game. There\u2019s no problems with the gameplay. My problems with this game is how terribly written it is. Keep in mind I don\u2019t care if there\u2019s LGBT people in this game. The problem is the characters make decisions that are just completely out of character in the perspective of the audience\\, it just doesn\u2019t sense to us. After surpassing the part where an important character meets his end\\, I was confused. I didn\u2019t have a problem with him dying but I had a problem with how he died. It seems like he didn\u2019t matter and his death served no real purpose to the game. I still don\u2019t understand the overall theme\\, I heard it\u2019s about letting go of revenge. That doesn\u2019t make sense.... It\u2019s a weak plot. In a world overrun by a deadly virus and tribalism\\, revenge is more of a motivation than a burden. If anything if revenge was something I wanted...The ending is incredibly underwhelming and makes me feel the hours I spent on it wasn\u2019t worth it. I don\u2019t care if a game has amazing graphics and great mechanics. If the story is terribly written then it\u2019s not worth playing. This game isn\u2019t even playable the first time\\, I had to force myself. You can\u2019t play this game more than once. I will be returning my copy right now actually. This is the last time I buy a Naughty Dog game. As a huge fan of the Last Of Us part 1\\, I bought the game on ps3 and ps4. Played them multiple times and played the online portion. Although\\, the game was always great because of its good story telling. Waiting 7 years and I\u2019m dissatisfied and disappointed. Who is making these decisions? Don\u2019t they have writers at Naughty Dog? If they had 7 years\\, that was more than enough time to polish a game\\, there\u2019s no excuse. Whoever is in charge of this game needs to be held responsible and Naughty Dog need to own up to their mistakes rather than attacking their customers and disrespecting them for not liking their low quality product. In my eyes\\, the Last of Us ended with the first game\\, the second never happened....\u2026 Expand","true":true}
