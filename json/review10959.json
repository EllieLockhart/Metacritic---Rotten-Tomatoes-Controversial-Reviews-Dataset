Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"haven't seen a good star wars movie in so long i am glad jj abrams started a new trilogy since the prequels were disappointing. thought the movie was excellent\\, job well done","true":true}
