Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This Movie is absolutely full of suprises and mystery that left me wanting ep 9 to hurry up and be in theaters. The only complaints abut the film would be Rose and finn\\, whenever their time on the screen happened it felt like the movie came to a hault especially whenever rey and kylo were on screen which credit to both actors for powerhouse performances\\, and also the purple haired lady was a bit of a stupid idea for the movie. But with those nit picks out of the way this movie is definitely worth the watch!!.","true":true}
