Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not only a bad Star ars Film\\, it's a bad movie in general.  Slow Pacing with a handful of amazing Scenes\\, but there is just too much fat that needed to be trimmed\\, and the tone was all over the place.  Serious moments were ruined with out of place humor\\, and of course almost not as many practical effects.  And Not a sub le character had any depth to them\\, they didn't l or change.  \\n\\nWhen Force Awakens and Rogue one came out I was enthralled.  Rogue One was miles ahead of this\\, which I find very sad.  \\n\\nI can't bring myself to","true":true}
