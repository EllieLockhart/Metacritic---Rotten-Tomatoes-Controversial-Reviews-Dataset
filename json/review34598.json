Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The brilliance of a few set pieces and the visuals more than overshadowed by a confusing plot\\, unrealistic character development\\, and unnecessary undertones of political commentary.  \\n\\nMany of the reviews from professional critics touch on these problems... though I feel the end scores are somewhat misaligned with their actual reviews. This is the worst episode in a great series in my view.","true":true}
