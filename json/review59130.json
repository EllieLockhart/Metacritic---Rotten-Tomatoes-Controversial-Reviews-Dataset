I got the platinum. With this game i was ready for something different. Not only was the narrative different it was clever and it resonated.Does anybody realize that ND wanted everyone to hate abby? They gave no reason to like her at first. She killed joel after joel and tommy saved her. We knew she had a reason but damn she killed joel!!This is now a revenge game in our minds for 15 hours. We gotta get that ****Then the confrontation comes and we bam switch to abby.I dont see why people say that naughty dog forced the sympathy with abby. Shes still an incredibly flawed women. She is \\\"a piece of **** as mel says. She also was ready to happily slit dina's throat after she found out she was pregnant.What we do find out is her motivation for killing joel. She spent 4 years making herself a weapon of revenge.While she watches her friends die over 3 days she tries to get some of what she was before her father died back by helping lev.In the end letting go of hate is the theme here for both women.I truly loved the experience of last of us 2 the gameplay was great the visuals where top notch and the game surprised me which is all that i could hope for.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
