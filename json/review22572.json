Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Let the past die\\, and do stupid stuff.\\\" should be the tagline. This movie deserves a zero just for what they do with Luke\\, or rather the missed opportunities with one of cinema greatest heroes. Watch the bland new characters participate in pointless plots while Luke and Leia are mere props for a non-existent story. The humor at first is refreshing\\, but soon becomes tiresome and makes everything a joke. Rian Johnson wrote a third tier fan-fiction that doesn't make any sense. Uninspired\\, it feels a times like a botched remix of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi without understanding what made those movies great. There is so many cringy moments\\, like this random kid force-grabbing a broom followed by a close up of his face watching the stars. It's long\\, we don't care about the characters and just keep watching for this moment we think it's going to happen that's going to make it worth it\\, but it just gets worse.","true":true}
