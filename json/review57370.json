Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie raped me of my childhood memories and sense of hope.\\n\\nBefore you waste your time seeing this horrific film let me describe what it feels like to watch it if you are a fan of the Original George Lucas Trilogy...\\n\\nYou feel as if though you're a 5 year old kid again and are gleefully playing with your Vintage Millennium Falcon Toy Ship\\, full of imagination and hope for the universe.  Then Rian Johnson walks into the room.  He grabs the ships out of your hand and opens the top bay doors.   He proceeds to drop his drawers and piss into the toy a few feet in front of your face.  You sit there stunned like THE DUDE in the Big Lebowski and simply mutter \\\"Not in the Millennium Falcon\\, man!.\\\"   Then just when you think he is done\\, Rian turns around and takes an actual dump inside the Falcon.  Rian mercifully exits the room.\\n\\nDespite feeling completely mortified and scarred by the experience\\, you gather yourself together and approach you cherished\\, childhood toy to assess the damages.  Then\\, just as you start to get a new hope that the Falcon can somehow be cleaned up\\, Kathleen Kennedy and the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Gang from Disney come into the room and start stomping the Falcon into smithereens like it's a Friggin HOT DIGGITY DOG jamboree!  \\n\\nHolding back tears at this point\\, The Horror just continues.  Next\\, enter a bunch of innocent looking Porgs who are carrying torches of Wookie fur.   They proceed to start the entire room on fire.\\n\\nFinally\\, you can't bear it any longer and are forced to leave the premises. \\nThen you spend the next 24-48 hours in a daze\\, questioning humanity\\, wondering how and why this happened and whether or not it could be fixed\\, undone or erased from existence.  ????????????????????\\n\\nIt CAN NOT.  It's over.  Everything you once loved about this franchise and the magic of it's movie making is gone.\\n\\nStick a fork in it and milk a green tit.  \\n\\nSTAR WARS is done.","true":true}
