Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible movie. This is the knife through the heart of the Star Wars franchise. Disney made it clear it only wishes to profit off of SW and pump out movies every 6 months to rake in the profits. You only need to have the slightest appreciation for cinema to recognize how disappointing of a film this was\\, and know only a fraction of star wars lore to see how shamefully Disney has treated the franchise. RIP Star Wars.","true":true}
