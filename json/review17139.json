Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really hated this movie. There is no hero's journey.  There is a one lane road chase where the rebels are running out of gas. There is no learning. There is no growth. There is no Luke Skywalker.  Someone looks like him\\, but he can't be Luke cause this guy was going to kill his sleeping nephew. Luke stood up to the Emperor and this guy couldn't be bothered to leave a planet to save his sister. I wish I had never seen this movie.","true":true}
