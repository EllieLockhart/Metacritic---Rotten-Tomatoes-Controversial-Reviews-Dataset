Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Critics in large have praised this movie to be a masterpiece when it was anything but. Its a discombobulated mess of a story that in some scenes just makes absolutely no sense. Some portions of the movie are literally recycled scenes from RTOJ. The comedy was cringe worthy and sometimes painful to watch. If Rian Johnson cares anything for the Star Wars franchise he will listen to the fans complaints about this movie. The money will always be there no matter who directs it. Listen to us Rian.","true":true}
