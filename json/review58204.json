Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You were supposed to bring balance to Star Wars\\, not destroy it! You literally threw away everything that was setup to you in the previous movies. Mystery? Forget about it. Lore? Forget about it.  Previous character development? Not needed. You really thought that Luke's mindset at that time would be \\\"Let me kill Ben first\\\"? After all he went through to prove that there was still good in his father. What\\, so now we are to believe he thought there was no chance there was still good in his nephew? No. It is not believable. Luke\\, at the time\\, was still connected strongly with the Force and would have sensed the conflict within him. Rey\\, who has had no training saw it instantly. Then we get to the plot itself in this movie. I get you were trying to show the middle act being where the good guys lose to set up for the comeback of the final movie\\, but you literally wasted our time. The casino was a complete waste of screen time.  The final fight made no sense at all and just wanted to show Luke die without actually losing.","true":true}
