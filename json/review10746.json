Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Half star is more than this travesty deserves.  Destroyed a beloved franchise to ram leftist political agenda.  Yay we ALL deserve to be Jedis!  Especially women and alien people of color!  Without any training whatsoever.  Why?  Because movies now have to be all-inclusive and non-gender\/race\/species biased.  And Chewbacca is now a vegan because the puffins or whatever are the new cute Disney plush toy prop to make $billions worldwide!  And capitalism is bad bad bad.  Except for the $billiions Disney is making on this trash.  For now\\, yes they will reap the benefits of unwitting SW fans going to this trash heap of a flick.  But can't wait til the next SW films and spin offs come out.  Good or bad\\, they will not post very good numbers in historical comparison.  Just wait.....","true":true}
