Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They don't count half a star put one star for them to count the ratingThe people putting 5 star scores are bots or people working for Disney because there is no way these many 5 stars would be popping up all of a sudden with in a couple of days. I've been checking these reviews for months with most of the ratings below 3 stars. Now for the review. There are so many things wrong with this movie like how they handled Luke Skywalker  and killed him off for no reason. How Rey all of a sudden knows everything to know about the force within a day of training and lifting some boulders. Its just so badly written that a drunk 5 year old could write a better story.  It was so bad that I made an account just so I can rate how horribly bad of a movie this was!","true":true}
