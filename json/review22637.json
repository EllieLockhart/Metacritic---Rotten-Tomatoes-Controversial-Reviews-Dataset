Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like any movie with a large budget the CGI was amazing\\, but that's where the praise ends. Plot holes\\, pointless sub-plots\\, random character motivations that make little sense\\, and tone deaf attempts at comedy interrupting serious moments in the film that rips you out of the moment. Its a \\\"meh\\\" film at best.","true":true}
