Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A Star Wars movie\\, but not a Star Wars movie. It officially called a Star Wars movie but it breaks cannon with all the movies\\, all the books\\, and even the Force Awakens. The kids are great. Rey is great\\, Kylo is great\\, and Finn is great. But the butchered Luke\\, Leia\\, and Phasma to an egregious extent. The movie has great effects\\, and is kid friendly. It's just I'm not sure that Rian Johnson has ever seen a Star Wars movie or has read any of the literature. One of the Star wars weaker efforts for sure.","true":true}
