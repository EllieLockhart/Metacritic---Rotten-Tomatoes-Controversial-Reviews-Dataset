Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great movie\\, even better the second time.  MY favorite since Empire Strikes Back. Moves the series in a good direction and provides a strong message about the need for change\\, for positive rebellion. Strong female leads\\, and the hope that the force is something even we are selves could find in our lives.","true":true}
