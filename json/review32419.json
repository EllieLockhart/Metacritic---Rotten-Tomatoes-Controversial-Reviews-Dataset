Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Starwars is lost forever\\, episode 8 at least had some great moments\\, but in general goes in the direction established by episode 7\\, with characters with zero charisma\\, bad written\\, with twists and plots that have no sense\\, and in general poorly written and boring.","true":true}
