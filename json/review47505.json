Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What I want to know is who paid these \\\"top critics\\\".  The top critics are generally more harsh than I am and there is no way 92% of them gave this film a positive revue.  This move SUCKED.  Snoke was a joke\\, Adam Driver should have never been hired (so hard to watch)\\, Rose Tico was totally unnecessary and a horrible actress\\, etc.  So many issues with this movie it's hard to know where to start.","true":true}
