{"101487":136538,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-12-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm giving this 1 star\\, because its a star wars film\\, but that's all.\\n\\nThis garbage is on par with the Star Wars Holiday Special for how it trashes the legacy of the original films.  And while the Holiday Special\\, as well as Splinter in the Mind's Eye\\, demonstrated that Lucas was prepared to go low to make a buck\\, we're 40 years past that now and somebody at Disney and Lucasfilm should have identified the issues they were creating with this film and changed course\\, same way they did with Solo and Rogue One.\\n\\nAll we can hope for now is that JJ can pull the rabbit from the hat and somehow retcon The Last Jedi\\, in the same way Rian Johnson used The Last Jedi to retcon The Force Awakens.\\n\\nMy suggestions (and I hereby relinquish all rights and claims to these ideas) are that:\\n1. Rey must be a skywalker - the episodes are about the skywalker family history.  Rey's parents are Luke and Mara Jade (who became pregnant to Luke but left before he could find out and then left Rey on Jakku to hide her from Darth Plagueis).  Either Kylo was lying to Rey about her parents\\, or Snoke planted a false memory in Rey's mind for Kylo to see\\, the same way he planted a false vision in Kylo's mind for Rey to find.\\n2. Snoke turns out to be Darth Plageuis (nicely tying the sequel trilogy to the prequel trilogy).  A tweet by Pablo Hidalgo denying Snoke is Darth Plagueis does not = canon.  Snoke being Plageuis would explain Snoke's backstory in one stroke and explain why he's able to do things with the force that nobody else has been able to do in any of the previous films.\\n3. Kylo or Chewbacca must die - Chewbacca will not let the murderer of his friend Han survive and would hunt them down so either Kylo dies\\, or Chewbacca dies\\, or both die.\\n4. Rey is now the Luke of ROTJ - her Jedi mentor is dead\\, she must construct her own lightsabre - she must suffer a loss though (she didn't know Luke long enough to form a strong bond - plus Rian had his character so whiny and negative in TLJ that Rey couldn't have found him likeable).  My vote is on Finn dying.\\n5. Bring R2D2 and C3PO back into the main story where they belong and make R2 in particular critical to the action - Lucas's original idea in the late 70's\/early 80's was that the two robots would be the only characters in all 9-12 episodes.  R2's memory wasn't wiped at the end of ROTS so in ANH and TESB he's definitely making noises and taking action to try to steer Luke away from joining the rebellion\\, and risks to his life\\, but without success.  Just don't give R2 rocket propulsion - one of Lucas's worse ideas for the prequels.\\n6. Leave the way open for another trilogy in 10-20 years - which will be about droid liberation - the droids are still slaves in this sequel trilogy\\, so Luke never did anything to progress droid liberation\\, no matter how much he might have thought about speaking up for droid rights when he and the droids walked into the Mos Eisley space bar in ANH.","true":true}
