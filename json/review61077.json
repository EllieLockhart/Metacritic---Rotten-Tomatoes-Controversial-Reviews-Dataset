This game is just a tragedy. Gameplay however is great as it brought forward a new dynamic to the franchise but the storyline is absolute TRASH. It totally shovelled up and butchered everything you would have loved about the first game\u2019s storyline. All the potential gone to waste\\, and character development gone backwards down the drain. I have no issueThe first game was a masterpiece. This game is just a tragedy.

No idea what was going through the minds of the Naughty Dog team and by that I mean first and foremost Neil Druckmann. Not sure what feeling they intended to incite in us but mostly all I felt was underwhelmed and disappointed especially in the end. After waiting 7 years\\, this game was a huge letdown.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
