Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The most unnecessarily controversial movie I've ever seen. Yes\\, the casino plot was unnecessary\\, but all the Rey\/Kylo stuff was great\\, and the Luke outrage is insane. A man who was taught and mentored by Yoda and Obi-Wan\\, who both made a sizeable mistake and went into hiding for years\\, would make a sizeable mistake and go into hiding for years\\, and that's out of character? Give me a break. Rian Johnson is brilliant\\, as always. It's not perfect\\, but anyone saying it \\\"ruined Star Wars\\\" needs to grow up.","true":true}
