Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"STAR WARS EP IX: Rey snaps her fingers and the rebellion wins. Kylo dies. Chewie dies from depression. C3PO and R2 become SJW bots And the whole galaxy gets sent far far away from my memory. END CREDITS?","true":true}
