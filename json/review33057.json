Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Stupid agenda of the Americans and Disney to put so much diversify the cast I'm brown\\, Indian  but why to unnecessary push these political agendas in movies there are plenty of movies where I love the different casts like Django unchained\\, Lara Croft etc they're original with their leads so many movies where I love Mexicans and blacks etc but why to spoil star wars\\, apart from that why this Rey girl is so perfect it's like watching Disney movies ohh right it's a effing Disney movie\\, man even the prequels we're better than this BS.","true":true}
