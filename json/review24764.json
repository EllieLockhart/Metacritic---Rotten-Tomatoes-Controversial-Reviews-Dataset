Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Much deeper than one might expect. It challenges the Star Wars standard line between good and evil and in doing so questions the very nature of The Force.  The conflicts presented are much more subtle than the binary black-and-white boxes Star Wars has historically used for its narrative compartmentalizations. Also\\, it seemed to purposefully  disarm any fan theories out there\\, which is my guess as to its apparent unpopular audience ratings here. I for one thought that choice was brilliant. Where it loses some of its momentum is its overuse of comedic injection. The Last Jedi fell into that modern script philosophy trap of \\\"INSERT LOL HERE.\\\"  Aside from its constant insistence that you should laugh\\, the film succeeds mightily.","true":true}
