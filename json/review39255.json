Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film had the potential of outshining it's previous trilogy counterparts\\, but it fell flat. The special effects are fine\\, the actors did well\\, but my issue was the story itself. It paced itself oddly\\, putting emphasis on garbage scenes such as the Finn arc and did not give more time to the only thing worth while in this movie: Rei and Kaylo Ren. It was almost like a Shakespearean play\\, with tragedy and comedy with romance\\, but it didn't quite make it. It kills me\\, and many other fans\\, how close they were to making a great movie\\, but it will hopefully force Disney to choose a not hack director for the last part of the trilogy.","true":true}
