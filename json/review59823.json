The plot\/pacing\/character development are so bad that it ruins the experience - it's giving me mass effect 3 flashbacks. You could have kept all the same messages and had a much better game if you had better pacing and character development (even just moving the order of things around). Some much of the great game play is ruined by the frustration of the previous cutscene that you can't enjoy it - and to those saying hey that empty unhappy\\, everything was meaningless feeling you get when you finish was the goal\\, \\\"the game is supposed to have that\\\"...why would I want my video game to end like that?
