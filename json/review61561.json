This is the toxic masculinity that they often trot out we should avoid.  If you want to have fun when you play a game\\, avoid this.  Outlast handled torture and strife better.  Dying light has better monsters.  They ignored the story of trying to actually deal with the plague for this claptrap.  I give it a 2 because it looks impressive enough.  The mechanics are bland and you have absolutely zero agency with the two players.  Think about it\\, this male 'feminist' takes away the agency of the wronged woman protagonist.  What was this game made for\\, other than some grotesque circle jerk with the writer and a mirror?Avoid the game and play something better.After going over Ghost of Tshuahima it proves this game is not fun.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
