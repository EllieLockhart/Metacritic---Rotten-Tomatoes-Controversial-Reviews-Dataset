Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is one to think about.  I personally found it to be a very welcomed departure from the norm. Yes this movie is different than anything they have done so far. But it's about time to break the mold.  In a universe as expansive as Star Wars\\, to not be able to go into new territory\\, will make it stale. While maybe not perfect\\, and no movie ever is\\, this was one of the best in the series.  It will keep you guessing as to what's going to happen\\, because you will be surprised.","true":true}
