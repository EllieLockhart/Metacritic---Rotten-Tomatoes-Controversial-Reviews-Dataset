Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A disappointing mess of a film that makes Episode I look Oscar worthy. The highlights are that Kylo ditches his rediculous mask and the reset button has been hit. However\\, they threw out the good with the bad in the reset. I wonder why episodes vii and viii were made in this case. Episode ix could simply have been made as Episode vii. I understand and respect what they attempted. But I left the theatre confused and trying to find reasons to like the film. Rogue One is much better.","true":true}
