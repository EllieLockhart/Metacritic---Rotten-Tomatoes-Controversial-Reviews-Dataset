Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The Last of Us 2 could have been a great game. But Naughty Dog chose to kill one of the most beloved game characters ever and then intentionally lie and mislead fans prior to release concerning said character. Of course I\u2019m talking about Joel. My problem is not necessarily the fact they chose to kill Joel\\, but the manner in which it was done. First\\, as previously stated\\, they intentionally misled and lied to fans prior to release. Then they killed him way early in the game in a brutal and extremely violent manner. Then they had the gall to have a character spit on Joel after his death. Totally unnecessary and as if they were spitting on fans. Then as a player you are forced to play as Abby who killed Joel! Obviously as a player I now hate Abby and have no empathy at all toward her or her reasons for killing him. I seriously did not want to continue playing at that point and intentionally allowed Abby to be killed over and over. As incredible and great as The Last of Us was\\, this game was equally that bad. No character development\\, questionable storyline and too much agenda injected. I was a dedicated Naughty Dog fan prior to this but now I will never trust anything they say or release and I am not sure I will purchase any more of their games. I don\u2019t enjoy being lied to and misled. I suspect I am not the only fan Naughty Dog has alienated. Too bad since this was so avoidable.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
