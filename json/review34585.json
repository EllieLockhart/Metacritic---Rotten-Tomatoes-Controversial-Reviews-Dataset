Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The biggest problem with this film is Luke Skywalker would never have considered murdering his own nephew out of fear. He knew better than that. then theres the nonsense of force texting...omg Lastly for Gods sake its been 2 films now and no real lightsaber fight. Keep the politics out of fucking Star Wars and tell a good story.","true":true}
