Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force Awakens was a great return to form after the drudgery of the Prequel Trilogy\\, and The Last Jedi continues the films journey into the more serious\\, dark territory that has been building since the introduction of Kylo Ren\\, our new Darth Vader. Rian Johnson has created a film which is perhaps too long and too busy\\, with many subplots of varying quality and worth. But it offers up massive thrills and real emotional heft. The story of Rey's training under the reluctant master Luke and her growing bond with Ren are the best parts by far. Ren's descent further into the dark side is beautifully complimented by Rey's increasing temptation by it. Mark Hamill is a most welcome return\\, looking suspiciously like Alec Guinness from A New Hope\\, and certainly not by accident\\, his gruff\\, sarcastic and tragic demeanour is exactly what we'd expect from a character in his position\\, and while many fans were angry about the resolution to his storyline\\, I thought it was very fitting\\, both in terms of story and character\\, leaving behind the old to make room for the new. Fin's subplot to find a code breaker is nowhere near as strong as the journey he had in episode in VII\\, and his attempted sacrifice at the end would have compensated for his relatively neglectful treatment throughout the movie\\, but that gets brushed off to force in a stale platitude about love and loss. Fans haven't been kind to this film\\, but a franchise like Star Wars inspires and generates so much passion that every reaction from a die-hard fan is bound to be strong\\, be it positive or negative. But I appreciate what it does\\, how dark and emotional it is\\, how good the acting is and how it progresses the story and demonstrates\\, maybe more than any other film in the series\\, just how dire the situation is for our heroes. But more than any of these\\, it got me well and truly hyped for part IX.","true":true}
