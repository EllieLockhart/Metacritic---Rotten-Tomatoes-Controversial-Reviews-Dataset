Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last jedi was just simply not good. I don't know how else to put it. With painfully clear placements of political and social statements Disney has turned the Star Wars franchise into a sentiment of hope\\, a sentiment that it constantly reminds viewers of despite the many painful grimaces given in response to them. This movie quite simply didn't feel like Star Wars and more or less felt like Walt Disney took each character\\, forced them to watch 50 first dates a couple hundred times\\, and then decided to put an all powerful galactic empire in the middle of everything. I have to say I have loved Star Wars all my life but this movie made me love it less. It's a sad day to be a Star Wars fan.","true":true}
