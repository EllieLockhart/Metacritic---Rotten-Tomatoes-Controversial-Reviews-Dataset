Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was underwhelmed. Awakens and Rogue One are better movies in my opinion. Was expecting more. The scene where Leia turns into Clark Kent all of a sudden\\, is the dumbest film making I\u2019ve ever seen. I could go on\\, and on with everything that\u2019s wrong with Episode 8. Hopefully Abrams can right the ship for Episode 9. ","true":true}
