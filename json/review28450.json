Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pretty cinematography and special effects\\, but that is so much sound and fury signifying nothing. The flaws in the Force Awakens were only exacerbated by the aimless narrative and thoughtless discontinuity of the writing. The sledgehammer of feminist agenda did help the \\\"resistance\\\" cause either. Rian Johnson & Kathleen Kennedy should be mortified by what they have do to the legacy of the Star Wars franchise\\, but they're laughing all the way to the bank\\, because lemmings will be lemmings. I for one will never spend another penny on Star Wars under Disney unless vast changes are made. Feh\\, and Fie and a pox on the House of Mouse.","true":true}
