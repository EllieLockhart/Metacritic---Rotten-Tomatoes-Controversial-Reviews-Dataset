Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not as avid of a star wars fan as I'm sure a lot of people on this site are. With that said\\, I've watched the movies\\, and this is by far the worst one. Even some of the previous movies that weren't as good\\, at least had a back story or at least some decent story telling. This movie was so all over the place I thought it was bad...I can't imagine how some of the more die hards feel about it.","true":true}
