Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the worst movies I have ever seen and the worst Star Wars hands down. Peter Pan Leia. Zeus Yoda. Lackluster Snoke. Slapstick humor overload. Plot hole abundance. Childish script writing. Do I need to say more because I could? There were a couple high points but way more disappointing low points. The prequels weren\u2019t quite as good as the original trilogy but they were way better than this garbage. This movie is an insult to Star Wars and George Lucas. The essence of all the previous Star Wars films is that they made the unimaginable imaginable. There are scenes in this film that make the unimaginable just flat out absurd. I will not be buying this movie\\, nor will I waste my time watching Rian Johnson\u2019s own trilogy. Honestly\\, I don\u2019t even want to see Episode IX after this mess of a movie. It was that disastrous and ruined enough of Star Wars. Help us Ron Howard\\, director of Solo: A Star Wars Story\\, you\u2019re our only hope.","true":true}
