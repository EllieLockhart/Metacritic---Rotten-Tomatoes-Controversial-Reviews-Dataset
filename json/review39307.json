Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is a great change of pace for Star Wars.  I cannot recommend it enough.  Easily the best Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back.\\n\\nEven though I loved The Force Awakens\\, I was genuinely worried about how they were going to follow that one up\\, because it felt to me that the deck was stacked against it.\\n\\n- TFA ended on a cliffhanger (of sorts)\\, and it pretty much required Episode VIII to pick up almost exactly where it left off\\, which would be a first for Star Wars.  The last time I saw something like that was with Quantum of Solace (picking up almost immediately after Casino Royale)\\, and I really did not enjoy that film.  I didn't think that there would even be a point to the opening crawl because of it\\, and I strongly feared that TFA may have put Rian Johnson in a corner in terms of how to handle the next film.\\n\\nAnd I think he nailed it.  I probably wouldn't have done the ending to TFA the way Abrams did (and I know that Rian at least played a role in that part)\\, but Johnson handled it way better than I initially thought was possible.  Opening with the Resistance making a desperate evacuation of their now-exposed base of operations to escape the wrath of the First Order\\, and staging a valorous (yet strategically unnecessary\\, as we later learn) space battle was an excellent way to handle the opening of this film.\\n\\n- TFA ended up sparking a lot of questions for fans (including some that I honestly felt either weren't intended to be mysteries or to have some huge reveal)\\, and given the amount of time between the release of TFA and Episode VIII\\, the history of Star Wars in terms of plot twists (such as Vader in TESB or the plot twist in KOTOR)\\, the fact that the internet these days (when it comes to critiquing films) borrows the methodology of CinemaSins far too much\\, and the fact that the Star Wars fanbase can be intensely rabid and pedantic (keep in mind how George Lucas\\, Jake Lloyd\\, and Ahmed Best reacted to the criticism directed at both the prequel films as a whole and also the criticism directed specifically at them)\\, I was concerned with how this film could be handled in a satisfying way.  Virtually every possible theory under the sun would be speculated in the time between the release of the two films.\\n\\nAnd I think Rian Johnson nailed it.  I know that the comment about how the film \\\"subverted expectations\\\" has been repeated ad nauseam already\\, but I can't help but chime in and agree.  It surprised me in pretty much all of the right ways.  From the moment where it becomes clear that Luke is not the man he once was to that key moment in the final battle\\, I was floored every step of the way\\, in ways that I was beginning to think wasn't possible in films anymore (not even Star Wars films).\\n\\n- Despite my love for TFA\\, I did have issues with it.  I feel that the criticisms that deride it as a mere \\\"remake\\\" of A New Hope are gross exaggerations\\, but I don't deny that the parallels are there\\, and I don't deny their significance.  This had me concerned that the new Star Wars films weren't going to take many (if any) real risks in terms of its storytelling and\/or characters.  I even explicitly stated at the time that I would not be as forgiving of Episode VIII if I felt that any and all parallels to TESB were too numerous and\/or significant to the same extent that they were in TFA.   never expected there to be absolutely no similarities\/parallels to earlier films (especially TESB\\, in this case)\\, as it's hardly a new phenomenon for Star Wars to repeat certain ideas; as Lucas once said: \\\"...it's like poetry\\, so that they rhyme. Every stanza kind of rhymes with the last one.\\\"  Even so\\, I wanted more than just that.  And I wanted Episode VIII to feel more fresh and new than TFA did (even though\\, again\\, I LOVED TFA).\\n\\nAnd I think Rian Johnson nailed it.  Yes\\, there were definitely a few moments where I felt the film could have taken MORE risks (I feel like they could have made Rey's decisions have more weight by implying a stronger temptation to joining the Dark Side)\\, and some moments that I felt could have been handled better (such as Canto Bight\\, which I felt could have been designed to look more exotic and alien than it did in the final film\\, and I took issue with BB-8's \\\"perfect\\\" moments\\, for lack of a better word\\, similar to how I felt about Legolas's \\\"perfect\\\" moments in the LOTR trilogy)\\, and there were definitely parallels to TESB (which\\, again\\, I NEVER expected to be nonexistent\\, nor did I think they had to be)\\, but I'd be lying if I said I was disappointed with the results in any significant way.\\n\\nI could go on for hours\\, but I'll leave it at that for my main takeaways.  This film exceeded my expectations\\, and it managed to surprise me several times in the best possible ways\\, which rarely happens with films today.  It made me feel like a kid again.  I think that it is the very film that Star Wars needed\\, I hope to see more like it in the future\\, and this makes me very excited to see what Rian Johnson has in store for his upcoming trilogy.","true":true}
