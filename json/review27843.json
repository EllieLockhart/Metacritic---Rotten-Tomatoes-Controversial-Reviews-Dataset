Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"petty clear that Disney has ruined the Star Wars franchise.I have seen the return of the Jedi in theaters and they never let you down in 3 categories. Sound design\\,visual effects\\, and story. All things Star Wars is known for. tLJ keeps the visuals and sound potion alive but destroys it in the story. Recommend get a writer who can capture what Star Wars is and keep politics out of Star Wars.","true":true}
