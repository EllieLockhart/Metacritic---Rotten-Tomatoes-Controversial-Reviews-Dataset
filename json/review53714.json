Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Generally horrible: \\n1. Plot and sub plots were lame.\\n2. Characters didn't develop (except Kylo)\\, and there were too many of them that they wanted you to care about. Truth is the only one I even remotely relate to after two movies is Kylo. Finn's story arch in particular is absolute garbage; and the movie would have been better without him.\\n3. Slap stick humor. That belongs in a Python film (love them)\\, not in Star Wars. I thought we had universally said that Jar Jar was horrible\\, and now there is entire species dedicated to comic relief. \\n4. Weird details that make no sense (like ships slowing down after running out of fuel... it's space.. there is no resistance).\\n5. Worst of all\\, it messes with the mythology and characters from the original trilogy. The Luke\/Kylo relationship should never have diverged that way.\\n\\nI did like some things:\\n1. Kylo Ren and Adam Driver as him.\\n2. The lightsaber fight was excellent.\\n3. The last 15 min were gold.\\n\\nAll in all\\, it felt like an Avengers movie set in the Star Wars universe. And that's not what Star Wars is. Especially disappointed because I thought Kathleen Kennedy and company fundamentally got what Star Wars was supposed to be after Rouge One. Ultimately I have no interest in the Han movie or Ep 9 now. Unfortunate.","true":true}
