Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The production value is really really good. So if that is all you care about\\, You will enjoy this movie\\, its a fun ride visually. But if you grew up with Luke Skywalker as your hero\\, you will despise this movie. They took over 30 years of story telling\\, and said\\, \\\"This doesn't matter anymore\\, your hero\\, was a coward all along.\\\"  I really enjoyed The Force Awakens\\, it was good\\, and it set up so many good lines of story\\, and this movie dropped the ball on every single one\\, not just Luke's. All they had to get right was Luke\\, and it would have been the easiest to do that. He is the most honest\\, courageous\\, optimistic hero in the Star Wars Universe\\, and this movie would have had people cheering\\, it would have made everyone so happy\\, and I mean everyone. No one can say they wanted Luke to come on screen and say \\\"Get off my lawn!\\\". It was the easiest thing to get right\\, and they refused to do that. Even dismissing the man who embodied him\\, as if there would be anyone who would have known him better. I waited my entire life to see my childhood hero\\, show me that age doesn't always turn you into a jerk. But I got the exact opposite.","true":true}
