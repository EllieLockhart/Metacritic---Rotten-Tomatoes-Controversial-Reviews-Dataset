Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a disappointing mess. So many plot holes and subplots that go nowhere and make no sense. It flippantly disregards all of the suspense and mysteries that Force Awakens built up and fans were waiting to find out how they played out. Worst of all\\, its treatment of Luke Skywalker is abominable. I am astounded that this script was written or approved by anyone that loves Star Wars or is even vaguely familiar with it. Mark Hamill's reaction to the script should have thrown up immediate red flags. He was right. Not my Luke. Not my Star Wars.","true":true}
