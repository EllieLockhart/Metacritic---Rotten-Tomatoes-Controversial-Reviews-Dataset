Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best star wars movies to date. It is a game of questions and answers. If you like movies that leave you with way too many questions\\,  then you loved force awakens\\, and will have trouble with this movie. The movie answers a lot about the Star Wars universe. I for one am very pleased too see most of Force Awakens questions answered\\, as well as the new Cannon Books being recognized\\, as well as the legend books. Artistry in this film is beautiful! The best yet honestly. Story wise still behind Empire\\, but right there with Rouge One. Overall\\, it is a very good movie for all\\,  newcomers and disgruntled fanboys as well.","true":true}
