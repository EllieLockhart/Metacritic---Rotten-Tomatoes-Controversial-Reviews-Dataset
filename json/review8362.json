Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Felt like I got ripped off for my money going to the theater to see this movie.  Disney completely screwed up star wars.  The movie is full of plot holes\\, doesn't follow the theology of star wars.  I will not spend money to see another star wars film again.","true":true}
