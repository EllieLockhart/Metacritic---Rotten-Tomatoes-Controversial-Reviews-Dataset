Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed this film and am really glad I got to see it prior to general audiences ruining it with spoilers and lowering enthusiasm. It was full of unexpected twists and turns\\, a roller coaster of emotions if you will. I find myself still processing what I have seen\\, days later. A second and likely third viewing will be a must. Enjoy Star Wars The Last Jedi for what it is\\, a great film\\, in a series of great films. ","true":true}
