Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film has excellent visuals and provides the Star Wars sensation that die-hard fans have been craving. The film also provides a very unexpected turn of events. This would have been spectacular if the movie didn't provide a genuine slap in the face to the most legendary Star Wars character of all time. The largest disappointment is the fact that there is no legitimate villain\\, making the story difficult to get excited about moving forward. There is nothing scary\\, mysterious or intimidating about Kylo Ren.","true":true}
