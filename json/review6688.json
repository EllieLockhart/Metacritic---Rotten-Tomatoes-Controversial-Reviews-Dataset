Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't expect any decent answers to the questions left by TFA. This film has a great cast who have been let down by a shabby and shallow storyline full of plot holes and character mishaps. it's as if all the director\/writer was bothered about was proving everyone wrong and making it a surprise rather than creating and in-depth masterpiece like it could have been. This film feels like a standalone generic sci-fi rather than the middle film of an epic saga. Ruined characters\\, no character development\\, pointless side stories and the first order reduced literally to a laughing stock. Before I watched this film I couldn't wait for ep9. But now I don't see how they can fix the problems left by this film. As a running the mill sci-fi its ok but as a starwars films it's interesting  rubbish. I only gave it 2 1\/2 stars because the visuals are good and the action is ok.","true":true}
