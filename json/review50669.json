Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"70% of Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a five star film. Not a single shot is meaningless nor a single beat wasted nor a single line unnecessary. However\\, the other 30% is the issue. The Last Jedi is scared to take risks: it is scared to spend it\u2019s second act without action; it is scared the audience will get bored without a laugh and\\, most importantly;it is scared it will lose the audience if characters meet their end\\, however fitting. For this reason\\, the other 30% of Episode VIII is a childish\\, cliche mess full of Deus Ex Machinas and flat characters. There is a flawless movie in there somewhere\\, but first you need to trim the fat.","true":true}
