Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a lifelong fan\\, the type that goes as far as collecting props\\, comic books\\, action figures\\, etc... I love the story of Star Wars and despite some head scratching\\, even the prequels didn't leave me disappointed. When The Force Awakens was released\\, I was ecstatic despite many of the same themes being regurgitated. I honestly believe JJ Abrams did his best to give us a rebooted story that could satisfy my starvation but also captivate my children into this new world of Star Wars.\\n\\nAs for The Last Jedi\\, I've never had any interest to leave reviews on Rotten Tomatoes before\\, I'm no movie critic\\, but after witnessing what Ryan Johnson did to the story of Star Wars\\, I've felt no less than compelled to.\\n\\nTo put it simply\\, Disney and Rian Johnson destroyed Star Wars. The mystique and folklore that George Lucas created with the original trilogy\\, the character arc that further developed through the prequels and onward with The Force Awakens and Rogue One has been at the very least\\, tarnished. Rian defaced the legacy of the Jedi\\, The Force\\, and all things Star Wars with cheesy comedy\\, useless side stories\\, unconvincing acting\\, and a plot that felt very disconnected from any of the previous films. \\n\\nIt felt as if Rian used dialogue to explain what was happening at almost every scene\\, and for most of the film the dialogue was so childish it felt like I was watching a live action of the children's television show\\, Star Wars Rebels. On the contrary\\, Rebels stays true to the story of Star Wars\\, The Last Jedi defecates on it.\\n\\nIf only this movie could be uncanonized\\, but it's too late\\, the damage is done.","true":true}
