Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was offensive.  I wish they hadn't made the movie.  So it doesn't matter if I like the cinematography or music or set design.  All that means nothing without a worthwhile screenplay.  The writer here is so incompetent to understand the characters not only from the history but literally doesn't get them right from the last movie.  He thinks Finn is a clown.  He doesn't know anything about the FORCE or space ships or even space.  He thinks humans can survive being blasted into outer space with no space suit.  I guess he thinks anybody (meaning nobody) can whip the butt of any Jedi Master with zero training.  It's just so aweful and weird.  I wish it wasn't made.  The entire Star Wars franchise is ruined.  It's over.  They made me give half a star but it's literally worth zero stars because Rian Johnson knows nothing about Star Wars.  Absolutely Nothing.","true":true}
