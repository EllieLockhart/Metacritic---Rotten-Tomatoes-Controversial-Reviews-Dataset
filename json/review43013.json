Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was way worse than the force awakens. The movie was about 30 minutes too long and there were several excessive plot lines. Also didn\u2019t like the introduction of so many new characters\\, the new rebel leader was terrible and Rose was a poorly acted character. It felt worse than episodes 1-3\\, this is now my least favorite Star Wars film.","true":true}
