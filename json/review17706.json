Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It committed the cardinal sin of any bad sci-fi \/ fantasy movie: it was boring. The long drawn-out chase that lacked tension or surprise made the movie feel longer than it was.\\n\\nThe second act was goofy in a prequels kind of way\\, and the story beats that the second act followed ended up not mattering. The star protagonist of the decades-old franchise\\, Luke Skywalker\\, was lazily written as the tired old \\\"guru hermit\\\" trope by a writer who clearly didn't understand the character\\, who seemed afraid to explore any growth or change the character may have undergone in the intervening decades. The conclusion was awkward and left the story pretty much dead ended\\, handicapping the filmmakers of the follow up. \\n\\nIts only saving graces were a pleasant aesthetic style for many scenes\\, and some solid acting from several members of the cast.","true":true}
