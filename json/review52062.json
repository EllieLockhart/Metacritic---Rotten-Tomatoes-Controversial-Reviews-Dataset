Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After reading the reviews and articles about the liberal agenda of the movie (cnn even commented on it)\\, i think ill wait for it to land on Netflix. I get enough of that from the media and collage already\\, and I certainly don't wont to pay for it.","true":true}
