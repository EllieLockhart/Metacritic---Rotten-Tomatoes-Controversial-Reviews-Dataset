Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Potentially the worst Star Wars film ever made. Good for cheap mindless fun\\, destroying a franchise\\, and unceremoniously ending the stories of some of the most beloved film characters in history\\, while at the same time negating nearly everything set up in the first film of the new trilogy. It will leave even the most dedicated fan of the series wondering why they've even bothered investing the time they have if this is what it has come to.","true":true}
