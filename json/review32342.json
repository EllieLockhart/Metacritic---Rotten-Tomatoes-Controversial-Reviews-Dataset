Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars is dead to me thanks to this film. What a shame as I have been a fan of the series for about 23 years. I understand that the prequels had their problems but I still enjoyed them for telling unique stories. This however is utterly Unforgivable! The director had Absolutely no respect or understanding of the source material. It's clear to me that both rian johnson and the corporate shill of a company disney have to meet their certain social and political agendas. I'm so Sorry Carrie Fisher\\, Mark Hamill & George Lucas.","true":true}
