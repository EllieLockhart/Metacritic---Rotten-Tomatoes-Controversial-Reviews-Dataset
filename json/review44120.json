Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To all the people that didn\u2019t like episode 8\\, get over it. I been a fan since 1977. I remember Luke found out a bout the force in 2 hour by Obi Wan. ( I want to come with you to Alderaan there is nothing left here for me. I want to learn the ways about the force\\, and become a Jedi like my father. Rey touches Luke light saber and gets a LSD trip. Luke is sad about a old man that he just met. I can go on. Let it go\\, you\u2019ll sleep well. ","true":true}
