Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Meh\\, What happened to the Star Wars wow factor? I have been a die hard fan since I was a child in the 80's. The Prequel Saga wasn't the greatest but I felt had more of a complete story. When I saw the trailer to The Force Awakens\\, all I could think of is \\\"Shut up and take my money\\\" and it did deliver to some extent. The Last Jedi has a very fragmented story with no organic connection in the story. Too many things happening at once and non of them make sense. I truly hope the writers and producers learn from this and step up their game for the final in this Saga. Also on a side note\\, who is rating these on the critics side? 92% for this movie and only 41% for Justice league? Both suffer from the same story line issue. Fragmented and lack luster. I personal would give Justice League 80% and Star Wars: The Last Jedi 55%.","true":true}
