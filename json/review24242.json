Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Meh. Some good moments but many corny ones. The plot was a mess and it could stand to lose at least an hour of filler. Yes the special effects were great but so what at this point. Still better than episodes 1-3\\, but worse than all 3 originals and Rogue One. I\u2019m confused that it got so many good reviews. It felt more like a Fast and Furious movie than Star Wars. True that Star Wars movies have big shoes to fill\\, but the series feels lost. The First Order is no Empire\\, and the Resistance is no Rebel Alliance. It just feels like a dumb blockbuster\u2014not Star Wars. ","true":true}
