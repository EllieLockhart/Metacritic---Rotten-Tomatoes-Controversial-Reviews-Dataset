Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are moments I enjoyed but mere moments. What really sticks in the mind upon viewing is the mountain of dropped plots coming out of The Force Awakens\\, the cringe-inducing new subplots and the metaphorical rape of Luke Skywalker as a character. This movie has the Star Wars name on it but it doesn't FEEL like Star Wars. It is a funeral for what Star Wars had been. \\\"Let the past die. Kill it\\, if Disney has to.\\\"","true":true}
