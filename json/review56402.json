Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"That's right RT\\, not a fake account\\, just another person who created their 1st account to vent about this movie. I'll vent quickly what everyone else is saying (Plot threads that are worthless and have holes\\, no character building\\, LUKE handling\/disrespect\\, Obvi Disney cash grab on the porgs). Kylo as a viliain is hilarious\\, is he supposed to be in his 20s? I could have sworn he was an angsty 15yr old from that movie. At this point I'm just coming to these reviews for therapy after what I just watched. \\n\\nAnd @ everyone who's saying the fans are taking it too hard and shouldn't get \\\"possessive\/feel like they own the franchise\\,\\\" it's called emotional equity. This is the goal of every movie\/brand\/etc. so yes\\, there is investment. From an objective storytelling pov\\, certain plotlines are unnecessary and a lot of time is wasted setting up things to fail.","true":true}
