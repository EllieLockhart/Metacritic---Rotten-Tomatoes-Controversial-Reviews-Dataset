Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS!!! Terrible movie. So dumb. Hey we are Disney and we wasted your money! Luke commits suicide for gosh sakes! He just wills himself to death! I think originally they were going to kill  Leia\\, but when Carrie Fisher died\\, they were like \\\"Everyone will see that coming\\, so lets not kill her off yet\\\". So in 2 years there will be minimal Leia\\, with what I am sure will be a terrible story to why she dies. Disney's magic hands have magically turned Star Wars - arguably one of the best dramatic franchises in history\\, back to complete dog feces. I feel like I stepped in dog feces and walked around on my carpet.","true":true}
