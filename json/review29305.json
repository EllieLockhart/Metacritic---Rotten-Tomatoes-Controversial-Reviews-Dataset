Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian got this movie wrong. Im a great fan of the original three films and The Force Awakens was a superb reboot that i couldnt have enjoyed more. This movie left me feeling empty and disappointed. Lukes storyline couldnt have been worse. After decades of waiting we find out that our hero is a sulking failure who almost murdered his nephew in cold blood. Hopes of there being a last minute recovery never happened and Rian makes sure no-one can change it by killing Luke off. Rian casually discarded all the storylines from the last film. Rey can lift a ton of rocks without even trying and without training. Force ghosts can touch things. Bombs fall in space without gravity. We know nothing about Snoke but he's gone. Knight of Ren? What has happened to Poe Damerons character? My heart sank so many times watching this film.\\n\\nI honestly don't know how Disney allowed this to happen. Surely someone at Disney who understands Star Wars was monitoring the story development? Personally\\, I want to see an apology from Disney. Continuing to state that a minority are unhappy is ridiculous and insulting. Only then is there a chance that there is a future. Needless to say\\, Rian Johnson wont make another Star Wars film that I'll watch.","true":true}
