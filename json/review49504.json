{"101487":199074,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow. Bad. So very\\, very bad. It is challenging to describe what is wrong with this movie without giving away any plot spoilers. So I will try to restrict to any reveals that the typical user will have already seen in the trailers.\\n\\nWooden characters. There are always those extras in the Star Wars movies who are very wooden and poor actors. You know the ones\\, the people who always announce their thoughts out loud? Well in TLJ they get promoted to be main characters. The result is dialog that just isn't believable.\\n\\nLack of any epic space scenes. I was pleasantly surprised with the space battles in TFA. In TLJ\\, not so much. There are basically zero confrontations between the war machines of the Resistance and The First Order. (Well that is not completely true\\, but it feels like there are zero\\, because what scenes there are\\, are just anti-climatic). I hope no one got too excited about those new AT-ATs they saw in the trailer\\, because they don't do much.\\n\\nUnexplained plot holes. Remember how Captain Phasma was left for dead at the end of TFA? Well\\,  you know from the trailer that she is alive and well (or at least someone in her silver armor). Curious as to how she managed to extricate herself from that garbage chute and confront the heroes again? Well those of us who saw the movie don't have any explanation for you.\\n\\nLightsaber duels. Yawn. There aren't any\\, or at least none of consequence. (Some will argue this point\\, but I don't think the main characters fighting a bunch of people we know nothing about\\, have never been introduced to before\\, or know anything about their abilities\\, really counts.) If you were looking for some sort of epic lightsaber battle between ANY of the main protagonists ... you will be disappointed.\\n\\nDrawn out emotional moments. In order for a character's death to result in any empathy from the audience\\, you have to be able to connect to that character. A character dying\\, who we have never met before\\, and to whom the audience has no emotional connection\\, doesn't really mean anything. (Sorry.) So when two of the main characters die (or appear to die)\\, it doesn't really exhibit any sort of reaction from the audience\\, because ... meh ... you don't really know these characters\\, anything about them\\, why they are doing what they are doing\\, etc.\\n\\nUnexplained abilities. I remember reading in Rogue One that the writers really struggled with the final scene and the appearance of Darth Vader. They wanted it to be awe inspiring\\, but they also didn't want for Vader to exhibit any abilities he has never shown before (since it happens in the past). Apparently the writers on TLJ didn't follow the same script\\, because there are two new Force abilities that hadn't even been remotely hinted at before\\, both of which essential to the plot development. So basically the writers wrote themselves into a hole\\, and the only way out was to make up a new Force ability that no one had ever heard of\\, and use it to have our characters dig out of the hole.\\n\\nSo very\\, very disappointed with this movie. There is now way that I can recommend this movie to any die-hard Star Wars fan\\, let alone someone seeing it for the first time.","true":true}
