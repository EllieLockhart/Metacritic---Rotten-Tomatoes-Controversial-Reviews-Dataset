Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just a bad movie. Discombobulated direction\\, miscalculated character arcs\\, and a massive wasted opportunity. Forced humour was painful. Sub-plot for Finn's character was inane. Benecio del Toro's character was unwatchable.  Yes\\, there were some good moments but they were easily overwhelmed by all the surprisingly bad one's. PLEASE no more Rian Johnson Star Wars films!","true":true}
