Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a rule breaker. \\nUnlike The Force Awakens\\, it completely changes course of following a familiar framework and takes an unpredictable course. This obviously blew uncomfortable steam up elite star wars fans skirts\\, but i'm undeterred in review in saying that is a movie that whilst being an entertaining space blockbuster\\, it has a lot of compelling writing that needed to happen in the franchise.","true":true}
