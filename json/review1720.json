Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a single work\\, The Last Jedi is the greatest in the franchise since The Empire Strikes back. It sports some of the most daring storytelling seen in the franchise in years\\, and it has fun while it's doing it. Like all second chapters\\, it will be good to eventually view this film through the lens of a completed trilogy and judge it as a whole. Until then\\, The Last Jedi is great!","true":true}
