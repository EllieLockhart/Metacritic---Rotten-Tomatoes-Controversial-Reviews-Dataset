Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The political correctness in this movie is simply out of control. How the movie depicts men is appalling and it doesn't do women any favors either. In the end the movie leaves you feeling confused and let down.","true":true}
