Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When I first saw The Last Jedi I left the theater feeling entertained\\, but confused. I wasn't really sure how to react to what I just experienced. I felt similar when I first saw The Force Awakens. The difference is after a few days of contemplation I realized I really enjoyed The Force Awakens (despite how much of a retread some of it was). With The Last Jedi a feeling of overall enjoyment never arrived. The movie was visually amazing with great cinematography. Rian Johnson did great at that aspect. There are some scenes I absolutely loved. There are other scenes that are simply stupid. The more you think about them the more ridiculous they seem. I wish someone else had written the movie script itself. The story was strange (and not in a good way)\\, loaded with plot holes\\, and basically threw out everything set up by The Force Awakens. It feels like a sloppy mess and certainly doesn't fit with the other existing movies. If Rian had been creating a standalone movie that would maybe have worked\\, but as part of a series\\, this movies is a miss.","true":true}
