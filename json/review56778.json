Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only really good aspects of this film were just related to seeing great scenes in this universe that we're trying to love\\, but this thing was a mess. Virtually every potentially powerful scene used pointless humor to undermine its own impact. The characters made no sense. Even Luke himself knows that his portrayal was simply misguided fan fiction\\, and stated it publicly. There is tons of 'idiot plotting' happening (trouble that could be solved by a simple conversation)\\, and so many of the fights make no sense. All of these problems pale in comparison to the damage done to the franchise by rules changes to how hyperspace works. The reason is this: It breaks the universe going forward\\, and backward for that matter.","true":true}
