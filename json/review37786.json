Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were faults thoughout the movie but all in all I loved it. On the contrary to what most people felt I was pleased with Lukes arc. He showed us that yes people do change and may loose part of who they once where but in the end he was the same old compassionate Luke we all knew...this time he just got a bit lost and took some time getting there.","true":true}
