Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was it terrible?  No.  Did I like it?  Not really.  Was it a good Star Wars movie?  No.  \\n\\nThe opening \\\"can you hear me now\\\" joke was infantile\\, and immediately pulled me out of the experience.  As a matter of fact most of the jokes were silly\\, and when combined with the break in the music to accentuate it\\, reminded me more of Space Balls than Star Wars.  Compared to Rogue One or Star War's snarky humor\\, this was childish\\, and out of place.  Luke throwing the light saber should have been accompanied by Benny Hill's \\\"Wakky Sax\\\". We were introduced to several new characters that dont seem to advance the movie.  Rose is plukky and very righteous\\, but has no arc\\, or importance.  Finn had to bring her to the Hyperspace tracker to... oh\\, wait\\, they never did need to do that because the new admiral blew it up anyways.  And the Admiral... another of Star Wars' \\\"Strong Female Lead\\\" stereotypes. With a costume that looked completely out of place.  Why kill Admiral Akbar\\, only to replace him with a character we don't know\\, and ultimately don't know if we are supposed to like?  Akbar or Mothma sacrificing the Mon Calmari cruiser to save the rest of the fleet could have been the ultimate closure to his character\\, and service the fans as well for whom \\\"its a trap\\\" has become part of pop cultures lexicon.  Speaking of sacrifices\\, the story beautifully gave Leia an exit that felt powerful\\, and resigned... only to have her come back in full-on CGI space float mode\\, and then spend the rest of the movie doing very little besides passing the torch to Poe as the leader he is going to become.  Lucas showed wisdom and killed off Kenobi because there was nothing more for him to do. \\n\\nOn the other hand several things were done right.  The revamped throne room scene was great\\, complete with crimson guards and an apprentice turning on the master.  Seeing Yoda again was an amazing moment\\, but learning that force ghosts can interact with the environment begs the question \\\"why didnt Ben do that to help Luke years before?\\\".  It pays homage to \\\"Empire\\\" while not copying it as blatantly as TFA did with ANH.  \\n\\nAnd then there are the mystery boxes.  JJ set up several mystery boxes in order to elicit excitement in the answer.  Who is Snoke?  Who are Reys Parents.  Will Finn be okay?  The answers are: nobody\\, nobody\\, and yes immediately.  In return he leaves us with new mystery boxes like... who was Snoke?  Is that really who Reys parents were?  Will the new character who almost died near the end be okay?  Why did Luke die?  How will Leia die now without using the terrible CGI that Rogue One employed. What good are the huge walkers with giant guns that seem to do no better than the AT-ATs at destroying things?  Why not send escort fighters with the bombers... and to that end\\, if you can just hyperspace into a ship to destroy it\\, do you need bombers?  Okay\\, those last few are nit-picking\\, not mystery boxes.\\n\\nFor the first time in as long as I can remember\\, I left a Star Wars movie thinking \\\"I dont know if I care to know what happens next\\\".","true":true}
