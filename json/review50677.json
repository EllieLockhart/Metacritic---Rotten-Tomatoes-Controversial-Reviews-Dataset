Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"7 and 8 has made the Skywalker family story incredibly tragic...too tragic in my opinion.  Vader always loved Luke and saved him from the emperor.  Ben Solo killing his father\\, Luke having thoughts of murdering Ben and Leia giving up hope in Ben makes the story unnecessarily and unforgivably too tragic to accept as a long time fan.","true":true}
