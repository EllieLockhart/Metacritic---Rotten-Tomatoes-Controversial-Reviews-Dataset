Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers \\nLuke not acting like Luke\\, space physics grossly ignored more than usual (bombs falling in zero gravity & the entire Leia sequence)\\, Snoke is an easily tricked dumb-dumb\\, sending a cruiser into a capital ship at light speed will kill everything (why is this not a standard fleet battle tactic?)\\, no real Jedi training for Rey\\, and Luke's final fight and death sceen are just some of the many reasons why this was an epic disappointment. Sorry for the crazy run on sentence. I'm angry.","true":true}
