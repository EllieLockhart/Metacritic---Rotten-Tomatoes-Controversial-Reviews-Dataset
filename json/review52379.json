Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A great deal of this movie was entirely too symmetrical with it's predecessor episode V. Certain scenes such as the casino and Cloud City are almost point for point identical. Kylo Ren still fails to inspire any emotion from the audience. His moments of frustration or anger are muted by the over the top acting.  The continuity of Luke Skywalker is an issue. It makes sense to show grown in a character over time\\, however\\, Luke shows none of his old personality traits. Additionally\\, his response to the hardships leading up to the events of this movie are poorly written. Lastly the misunderstanding between Luke and Kylo is one of the cheesiest weakest tropes in all of writing\\, and should not be the focal point of your series. The constant blunders in this series are quickly bringing a time when we no longer go to movies just because they're called Star Wars.","true":true}
