Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think this movie lacks any real substance\\, the characters were poorly used. The development of newer characters were flat and lacking and real connections to who they are. The progress of the movie would slow and feel unnecessary. The Plot holes are endless. Im very upset on how Rian Johnson utilities not only Luke but his relationship with Rey. I could go on\\, but Im more curious as to how JJ Abrams will continue from here. ","true":true}
