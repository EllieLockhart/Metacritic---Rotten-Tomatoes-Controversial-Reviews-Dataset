Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a must see for every Star Wars fan out there and every action movie fan out there\\, too. If you are someone who enjoys a decent enough plot and action sequences with scenes that take your breath away\\, then this movie is for you. \\nI went into the movie theater expecting something entirely different from what I eventually saw in there. This movie has everyone hyped for it's sequel\\, even those who did not expect some of the events to play out the way they did. Rey\\, Kylo and Luke were stand outs in this movie. Some plot lines could have been cut in some way\\, to reduce the overall length of the movie\\, but even those have a pay off in the end. Props to Rian Johnson","true":true}
