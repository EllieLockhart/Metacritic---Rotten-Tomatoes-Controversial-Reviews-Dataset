Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The weakest SW movie since Attack of the Clones. Many plot points are poorly thought out\\, and the characters are split into several nearly unrelated plots. Most disappointingly\\, despite being described as subversive\\, the movie ends with a very conventional return to the status quo.\\n\\nA clear symptom of the disorganization of this trilogy's story is that two of the three major protagonists meet for the very first time at the end of this film. The trilogy is two-thirds over\\, and the main characters don't interact with each other. It's a bit of a mess.","true":true}
