Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not even worth a rental. \\n\\nThis film spits on the original trilogy and I'm at the point where I don't think I can ever take a Disney film seriously again. Times have changed. Now\\, instead of creating films that explore via a fun escape\\, stories are being hijacked and given a political undertone which gawks at the majority of people on this planet.\\n\\nShame. Disney. You're 2D animation age was supreme! Now look at you - pure burning trash.","true":true}
