Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The visuals were amazing and the sound engineering was great. Almost everything else about this movie made it hard to take seriously. The dialogue was stiff and strange\\, the plot was not engaging\\, and the movie lacked any form of serious conflict. The Last Jedi is a waste of 2.5 hours.","true":true}
