Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is my favorite of the sequel trilogy. Now\\, it's not flawless but the biggest problem of this movie is the structure. The first act and the second act are both equally long which is not the traditional structure of making a film. The second act is usually 1\/3 longer than the first act. Another issue is that the film is comparatively slower paced in the first act. Regardless\\, it is a great entry in the franchise and my third favorite Star Wars movie. It is however not the best movie in the sequel trilogy because the Force Awakens was better paced and edited\\n\\nA 9\/10","true":true}
