Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"+ nice graphics\\n+ good work of John Williams \\n\\n- RUINED THE IMAGE OF LUKE SKYWALKER\\n- messed up story ( even worse then episode I II III )\\n- waste of characters\\n- waste of new charaters\\n- the have no rules anymore\\n- plot holes \\n- plot holes\\n- plot holes\\n- POOOORGS","true":true}
