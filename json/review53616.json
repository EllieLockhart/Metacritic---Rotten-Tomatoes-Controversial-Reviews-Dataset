Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First came the abomination that is The Force Awakens  and now here we have The Last Jedi a flaming piece of garbage that puts the final nail in the coffin (Soylo: A Star Wars Story flopped for a reason) They have destroyed the Star Wars we all know and love. The sheep\\, shills and social justice warriors have tried bringing up the percentage but nothing can save Disney and their atrocious films from the fandom menace who as customers will simply spend their hard earned money elsewhere. Star Wars is dead.","true":true}
