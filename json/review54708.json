Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really\\, really want to say something constructive but it is really\\, really difficult.  There were definitely parts to this movie that I enjoyed\\, specifically\\, those involving Luke\\, Rey\\, Kylo\\, and Leia.  But truly the rest of the film is basically throwaway material.  Absolutely nothing memorable.  I felt like a whole 25% of the storyline could have been discarded and no one would miss it b\/c it has zero bearing on the plot and the intention of its inclusion could easily have been handled in a different manner.  The whole tone of the movie felt like a B-list movie trying to copy an A-list movie and failing.  Regarding the huge disparity between critics and audience\\, I can only guess that critics are afraid to say what they really feel in fear of disrespecting the memory of Carrie Fisher.  There can be no other explanation.  Where this Star Wars will lose is in repeat audience\\, or lack thereof.  So\\,it will hit huge its first weekend\\, but likely fade very quickly at the box office.","true":true}
