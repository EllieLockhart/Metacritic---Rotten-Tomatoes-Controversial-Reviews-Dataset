Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely wonderful film. Filled with moments of pure cinema magic\\, for my money anyway. Viewed three times at the cinema\\, and got better with each viewing. I can see why some people didn\u2019t like it\\, but seemingly for the same reasons I loved it even more. For what it\u2019s worth I rate this as joint third for my favourite Star Wars movies\\, along with return of the Jedi. A New Hope sits at 1\\, and The Empire Strikes Back sits at 2.","true":true}
