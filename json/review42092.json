Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie proves that you cant throw money after shit and expect to strike gold.\\nhow the hell can this movie have a higher rating on Tomatometer of the Star wars movies than Return of the jedi?\\nI've heard the director made this a film with a theme of failur and boy did he hit the spot and made a failure.\\nThere is so many things wrong with this movie i cant even go through them all. Watch the critiques online that goes through them.\\nStory - is boring and leads nowhere. You can pretty much say that the movie has no story at all and only plot. Shit just happens but doesnt mean shit to the story since there is none.\\nCharacters - are either boring\\, non-progressing or pointless. Why are villains made into fools? That is not what makes a good villain.\\nComedy - is not funny and misplaced. \\nThis was the first Star Wars movie i didnt watch in theater since i was dissapointed on The force awakens. This movie was so stupid that it doesnt seem like Star Wars anymore. Will never watch it again and probably never see another Disney SW movie.","true":true}
