Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Forced political agendas\\, poor character development\\, awkward forced and unfunny \\\"comedic\\\" moments that are so out of place. The massacre of Luke Skywalker's character\\, no continuity with Episode 7. The entire side plot with Finn & Rose Tico was horrendous. This move is a total mess and has pretty much completely destroyed the sequel trilogy. This movie renders Episode 9 pointless. There's no way they can salvage this trilogy's story arc in one more final 3 hour film. Episode 7 wasn't anything special but with episode 8 & 9 there's was room to grow and improve. Then The last Jedi happened and shit on everything that makes Star Wars\\, Star Wars and now there's is absolutely no saving this sequel trilogy. Well Done Rian\\, You'll forever be remembered as the guy that ruined Star Wars.","true":true}
