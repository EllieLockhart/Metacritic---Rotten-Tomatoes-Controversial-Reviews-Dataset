Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everything technical wise was great\\, however there was alot of forced humor that gave me a guardians of the galaxy feel about it i felt like it was an snl parody at times. Alot of silly \\\"mary sue\\\" esc situations along with alot of wasteful subplots and scraping of great characters and character ideas and theories alot of missed potential. Some things from the force awakens aren't present making one wonder if there was scraping of certain figures or ideas. Felt very let down and quite dissapointed at the direction taken by rian\\, he allowed alot of piss poor lazy dialog to be in the film which was quite reminisent of the prequals. Sad and disapointed overall didnt like the story line or any plots earns the rating based on cinemtogrophy. Yes risks were taking and kudos for trying rian but it wasnt my cup of tea and wasnt many people favorite either.","true":true}
