Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was one of the worst Star Wars movies I've seen in a long time not since Episode 1 has one been  this lame. . It left people feeling like the whole order of the original premise of the Jedi was highjacked along with the Star Wars saga\\, by people with leftists political agendas currently happening in these United States. Removing the role of men and manhood and replacing it with a more feminine and transgender influence. What a joke. Star wars and movies in general were at once a place for escape for movie goers from the real word so to speak. Luke Skywalker's character was the most disappointing for a Star wars fan. I may never again go to see Star Wars even if there is another made. I choose now to \\n\\nremain forever as thinking that Star Wars ended with the Return of the Jedi\\, as the last seen clearly shows. Thanks alot Disney you can kiss your true Star Wars fans goodbye. Word of advise. Don't bother making any more and go back to cartoons.","true":true}
