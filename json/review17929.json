Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think even Walt himself is rolling over in his grave. It's like what the WWE has done to wrastlin'. All cutsie and lacking depth and substance. Oh yeah\\, the new Furbies were over done. Still a fan\\, but so under impressed. (perspective of a crotchety old man per my oldest son that can't handle the truth).","true":true}
