Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A good movie\\, not a masterpiece ( and the franchise never been one) but an enjoyable movie with an interesting take on the Star Wars universe and its mythology. A few scenes could've (should've) been cut or shortened tough.","true":true}
