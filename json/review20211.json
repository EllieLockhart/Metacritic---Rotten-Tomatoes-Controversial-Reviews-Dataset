Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"it was ok\\, some great moments (that had even higher unreached potential) but so many tonally off moments that don't fit properly in the star wars universe.  the 2nd act of of the film really had not much going on and lost my attention a few times.  they completed wasted snoke (who should have had a rich mythology to his character) and rey+luke relationship didnt amount to much at all.  leia + luke +kylo ren performances were great and their characters were well served.  everyone else I'm not so sure.  they are also really milking (overusing) the force theme songs to the point its predictabilty played on cue bordering cheesiness.","true":true}
