Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Incredibly lazy and low quality writing\\, forcing political ideas in sf movie couses that poe even thou he did everrhing right is being yeld at all the time by his perfect Co officers\\, the admirals ship crash manouver is lazy idea  that leaves grand holes in all future and past space bettle tactics\\, destroying galaxy greatest hero\\, portreid as bitter weak old man\\, even Mark H. hated the new Luke\\, weasting of Snoke character\\, ect","true":true}
