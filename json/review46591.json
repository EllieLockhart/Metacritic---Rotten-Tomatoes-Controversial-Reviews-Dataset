Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Watch this movie Terribly written\\, empty characters\\, and plot let downs again and again. The  professional critics are not being truthful that high score is a fabrication of their imagination liken to a politicians bubbled chad that wins an election\\, an illusion and their now they also are lacking true credibility. This movie is not written for star wars fan but a new generation \\nThe indoctrination of a nation. I need you to watch movie some how! Wink come back write a review please maybe they can not take over audience score please write review score it thank you! Pick another movie leave star wars alone\\n\\nSent from Yahoo Mail on Android","true":true}
