Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\nWhere do we begin..\\nThis movie is an absolute disgrace to The Star Wars Saga.\\nRian Johnson was brought onto this project after JJ Abrams adaptation The Force Awakens. One of my personal favorites. Rian Johnson decided for some reason that he hated everything JJ had built up in the last movie\\, things such as Rey's Parents\\, The identity of Supreme Leader Snoke\\, Captain Phasma\\, The Knights of Ren\\, and many side stories.\\nMany characters still needed more screen time to building up their backstories. Rian however felt it was necessary to destroy everything TFA built up and wipe the slate clean. Add new characters such as Rose. Characters who take away from the plot.\\nLuke is completely changed as a character. His morals are changed.\\nRey becomes one of the greatest Jedi in the galaxy with little to no training.\\nKylo is still torn between the dark and light side even though in TFA he had turned after killing his father. \\nRian Johnson let his ego turn him to the dark side. He lost control and this caused many plot holes to surface throughout the film.\\nThis film had some great visuals which is why it got 2 stars which seems generous. Overall horrible film. Do not recommend seeing.","true":true}
