Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I got a Rotten Tomatoes account only to give my rating in hopes that it may be the tipping point for someone not too see this movie. This movie is garbage\\, it's barely a Star Wars movie\\, the plot holes are ridiculous\\, the characters are a joke. Don't GO!!!! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T GO!!!!!!!!!!!!","true":true}
