Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terribly disappointing. Usually I think that Star Wars fans are impossible to please and should just relax and enjoy a film for the entertainment of it. But this time I understand their bile completely.  I tried really hard to like it\\, but 3\/4 of the way through I couldn't deny it anymore\\, Disney was really trashing Star Wars and its fans.  The stupid answers to question people excitedly discussed for the past two years were a thumb in the eye.  The less said about the bizarre agenda pushing in this film the better.  The two stars are solely for the visuals\\, which were stunning.  I am definitely not in a hurry to see another Star Wars film.","true":true}
