Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For me this movie get a solid 8\/10! Now it is definitely no masterpiece\\, far FAR from perfect\\, There are a lot of plot holes\\, subplots from Force Awakens are dropped\\, the comedy is so pointless\\, and there's just moments in there and I was beginning to worry that it would get even worse\\, but it didn't. It's true that The Last Jedi is full of problems but it has a lot of amazing things that make up for those flaws: Mark Hamill's performance is amazing\\, a fitting send-off to Carrie Fisher\\, Addresses flaws to the Jedi And The Rebellion\\, It's Genuinely Unpredictable\\, it has the best lightsaber fight i've seen in a long time\\, and the best starship battle i' Seen in a long time\\, it has Amazing Cinematography\\, just the right amount of Porgs (those little chicken-Bird things aka they're so cute and adorable... and tastes like chicken)\\, the message of hope is as relevant as ever\\, and a rejection of Nostalgia! In the end\\, there is a lot to enjoy in this movie\\, and I could say a lot of bad things about it\\, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it\\, in fact I liked it a lot. The CGI And the backgrounds are spot on and very beautiful to look at. The Last Jedi is one of the most beautiful looking Star Wars films i' Seen to date and not one that would appeal to all the fans\\, which is why I say that the movie gets a 4 star rating (8\/10)!","true":true}
