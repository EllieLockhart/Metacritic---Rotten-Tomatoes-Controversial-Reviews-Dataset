Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a mess! Killed the questions left from the force awakens\\, waited two years to see Luke in action just to see that garbage ending for him?! Wow\\,  pumped up Snoke so much saw a glimpse of his power and he's taken out like nothing\\, cmon! I hope the reviews kill it at the box office because maybe itll send Disney a message\\, as for the next solo movie i wasnt gonna go see it until i heard Vadar was gonna be in it but after this joke forget it\\, i know their formula now\\, put in a few popular characters to get people in the theatre and who really cares about the story. DISNEY !! GET SOME REAL STORY WRITERS FOR Ch#### sakes.","true":true}
