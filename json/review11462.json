Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible movie. Even if viewed as a single movie. But as the 2nd part of a trilogy..? Even worse! This movie seems to not care about the 1st movie at all. It completely disregards plot lines that were introduced in the force awakens. And instead spends nearly half the movie on some random plot that seems to be totally insignificant to the plot of the trilogy as a whole. It is so sad that this garbage is allowed to taint the Star Wars universe","true":true}
