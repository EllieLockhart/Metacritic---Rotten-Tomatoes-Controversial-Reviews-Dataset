Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*Spoilers below* \\nSome good. Some bad. Lots of inconsistencies. I could go on for a long time explaining the way this movie fails to live up to Star Wars cannon by giving the Jedi new powers\\, how some of the side stories merely took up precious movie time while the makers of the film ignored the important back stories of both Snoke and Rey\\, or how the main plot was simply a glorified slow motion police chase. I could\\, but I won't. I just hope that Disney sees the disappointment of the Star Wars fans and keeps us in mind when they make the 9th movie. If not\\, I guess the fans can just treat it like they treat the prequel series.","true":true}
