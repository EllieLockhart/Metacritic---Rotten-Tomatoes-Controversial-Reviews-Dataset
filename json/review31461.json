Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some pretty glaring flaws\\, and about 30 minutes too long\\, but interesting\\, daring choices\\, and a home run thematically make this such a better entry than TFA. It\u2019s really good. Just not amazing. ","true":true}
