Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was really hype for this movie and even rewatched every movie in the star wars saga preparing for it but after watching it i felt as if this was more like an episode of a star wars tv series as very little happens to the story and seems like some parts were rushed to be finished by release date. The canto bight story of rose and finn is completely irrelevant and roses character is just... ugh. Admiral holdo is pretty cringy and the scene where she and leia simultaneously say may the force be with you and then laughed just made me cringe so hard. Some really strong parts about this movie are the acting\\, action\\, plot twists\\, and i find kylo ren to be such a badass and amazing character. And the fight between luke and kylo is fantansic. And one of the greatest things about this movie is the details\\, Lukes feet not turning the salt in crait red because he is a hologram or image\\, the jedi texts in the millenium falcon. Overall i would give the movie a 76.","true":true}
