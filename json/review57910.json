Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a pile of poo this film is. There are so many plot holes my 10yr old came out of the cinema wondering what the last 2.5 hours were about. TFA wasn't the greatest Star Wars but what it did do was provide a good base foundation to build this film on. TLJ shits all over that\\, killing off cool characters before their time and destroying those characters left alive. The whole time trying to push a political agenda. Appalling story line\\, lazy writing and questionable motives.","true":true}
