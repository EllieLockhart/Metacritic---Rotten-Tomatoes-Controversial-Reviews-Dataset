Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What an absolute turd. I've never reviewed a movie before and I signed up for an account here just so I can express how much of a turd this movie was. Apparently\\, all the \\\"Critics\\\" are paid off by Disney and anyone who otherwise liked it is an idiot. Rian Johnson\\, you SHOULD take it personally when fans tell you that you ruined this movie. This is some absurd vision that you created and thrust into the canon. Did you think you signed up to write\/direct a sequel to Space Balls? All the JOKES. THE F'ING STUPID JOKES. This year was miserable already because of Trump and you really just finished it off. Thanks a lot.","true":true}
