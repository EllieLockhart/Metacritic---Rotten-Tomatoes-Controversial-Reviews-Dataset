Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It did not respect Star Wars Lore and Luke's character.  Lot's of plot holes.  Why all this war in episode VII to find Luke's map if he don't want to be found!?  What's the point of Anakin being born directly from the force if anyone in the galaxy can have it freely...??We don't want moral lesson in star wars\\, Just courageous fearless heroes in lightsabers duel.","true":true}
