Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You know what annoyed me the most about this movie? It wasn't that Snoke died. (Spoiler) It's that he got cut in half. \\n\\nBut the film clearly shows that he wasn't cut in two. He just falls apart\\, for no reason. (Like a lot of plot points in this film\\, but I digress.)\\n\\nHe gets stabbed in the side. Unless his brain or heart are in his stomach that shouldn't kill him. Then the blade is dragged out of his body\\, not through it. Worst case scenario his guts spill out. The blade never passes through his back or spine.\\n\\nNot that spines exist in these films if Finn's recovery is anything to go by.\\n\\nDoes Rian make sandwiches by stabbing the bread and pulling the knife out the top? It must take forever.\\n\\nIt's like watching Qui-Gon get stabbed in the chest (Spoiler) and then for no reason his head just falls off. That would be weird\\, right?\\n\\nWhat a strange movie this is. I don't understand it. Any of it.","true":true}
