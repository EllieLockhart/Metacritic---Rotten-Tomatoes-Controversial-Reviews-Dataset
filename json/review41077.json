Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had a lot of potential. It felt too long. I liked the last 30 minutes the best. I think they should have started the Finn\/Rose story line at the casino... I really don't think there were any suprising twists. The infinity Rey scene was a little bit of a disappointment. I hope the next one is better. I actually liked Rogue One better.","true":true}
