Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was this a perfect movie? No. \\n\\n\\nHowever\\, this is the Star Wars movie that we needed. If we are going to receive a new Star Wars movie every single year\\, then we are going to need to be able to accept change and subversion. \\n\\nI found this film to be extremely entertaining. I liked how it simultaneously supported the morality of the war between Light and Dark while also showing that this eternal conflict is exploited and\/or avoided by the larger universe. \\n\\n\\nThis is a movie which takes risks and slaughters sacred cows. Unlike TFA\\, I was never quite sure what to expect. I guess\\, above all else\\, that is what I appreciated the most. Unlike TFA - I didn't guess the entire plot before the opening crawl.","true":true}
