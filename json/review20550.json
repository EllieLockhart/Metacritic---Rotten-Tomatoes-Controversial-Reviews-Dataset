Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've loved the last 2 new Star Wars and expected this to be just as good\\, sadly not. The acting was pretty bad\\, the pace was too slow and the story was pretty weak. I thought about leaving before the end\\, I now wish I had.\\nI would love to know who the critics are that overall gave it a 91% rating\\, did they watch the same film as everybody else here\\, who gave it a 49% rating!!!","true":true}
