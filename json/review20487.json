Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a Star Wars fan since I met Mark Hamill at the World Science Fiction convention the year before the first movie (not then known as \\\"Episode 4\\\") came out\\, and I haven't enjoyed a Star Wars movie as much as this one since then. \\n\\nYes\\, The Last Jedi takes the story and the characters into new territory. No\\, Luke didn't turn into the inspirational mentor as Obi-Wan\\, nor a great teacher\\, like Yoda\\, but that's kind of the point. None of us live the same lives or end up in the same places as our parents and teachers. Luke's path is his alone and it has ups and downs\\, surprises\\, both good and bad\\, along the way. Likewise Rey isn't Luke\\, nor Anikin\\, though they all are strong in the Force and come from desert planets.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi\\, like the best of the films that come before it\\, has lessons for us that apply not only in the Space Opera world of the Jedi and the Force\\, but in our own lives. It also has tears\\, and surprise\\, laughs and heart-warming moments\\, and many of them are not the ones we expect\\, which is a GOOD thing. There's no point in teaching us the lessons we already no\\, no surprise in recapitulating history. \\n\\nRian Johnson has done a wonderful job at making the story new again. Hamill's performance as the man Luke never expected to become does the young man I met (and the mentor that he was so enthusiastic about having worked with) proud. Did I want to see Luke grow the way he did? Not really. Did I believe it? Yes. Was I moved by it? Certainly. Did the others-Daisy\\, Kelly\\, Adam and John\\, especially-sell me? Yes. \\n\\nI want to see what happens next and I'm looking forward to the next one more than I have in four decades.","true":true}
