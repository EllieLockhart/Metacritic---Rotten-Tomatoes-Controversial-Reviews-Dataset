Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie of the star wars saga\\, as fan this is a wtf movie were nothing is explained (and the few things that are explained are dissapointing). There are A LOT of unecessary scenes\\, and also the logic that has been followed since A new hope is broken in this movie (I mean is ok to introduce new ideas in the films but seriously? Leia using the force to get into the ship?).\\nIn summary\\, an unlogic movie that has some of the most intense moments of the saga but this intense moments end with wtf situations.","true":true}
