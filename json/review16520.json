Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In 1977 Star Wars became such a part of peoples lives from the late seventies until present day garnering die-hard fans along the way. Cementing itself in more than just movie history. Even the second prequel trilogies (although directed with new digital techniques giving the movies  a differing artificial finish and synthetic look from the original episodes distressed and lived in authenticity) are loved because they expanded the SW universe deepening an already profound story that fans heard memories of from older characters in the first movies. With episode 3's emotional & violent end star wars had come full circle we thought we'd seen and heard last of Star Wars..........  And then Disney came along with their bundles of cash and we delighted that we'd get to see the massive Star Wars universe with todays filming techniques.. JJ Abrams kicked it off fairly safely with Force Awakens nowhere near as great as A New Hope but we had new hope in what would come next........... Unfortunately Rian Johnson came next with the Last Jedi and that was the Last of anything Jedi we'd ever care to see. Rian Johnson killed Star Wars with the worst Episode ever. Bye Star Wars. The End.","true":true}
