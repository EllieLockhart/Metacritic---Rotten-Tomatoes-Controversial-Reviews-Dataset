Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I found the movie completely enjoyable and loved it.  I loved the character development of all but Rose who I felt was a little unnecessary in the movie.  Action was great and the comedy was used to make all of the characters feel more humanized.  I agree with the reviews that mention there is a bit of a plot hole in the way the movie was moved forward\\, but I am classifying it as a McGuffin much like the Death Star.","true":true}
