Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While many stand conflicted with Episode VIII\\, Star Wars the Last Jedi does prove that change may very well be for the best. With the element of surprise and unique plot twists\\, the Last Jedi leaves its fans and newcomers alike with a number of character driven motives providing a great discussion for the franchise's future. Ultimately the movie does everything a Star Wars movie should do\\, despite its weak points and somewhat forced story gaps. In short\\, one should be prepared for the new direction the movies will eventually take before going to see the Last Jedi. As a personal fan of the original trilogy\\, I only ask other fans to not lose sight of the very deep and powerful lessons that the Last Jedi leaves us with. Even if all seems lost\\, even if change seems inevitable\\, there's still hope. There's still a balance between good and evil. The force is still very much with us. ","true":true}
