Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible star wars installment\\, horrible film in general. Poor storyline and setting. Too many inconsistencies and contradictions within the film itself and with other star wars canon\\, including the previous installment itself. Many unnecessary pedestrian scenes and characters\\, I assume for Disney to sell toys off.","true":true}
