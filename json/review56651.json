Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi (TLJ) is a Star Wars movie unlike any other Star Wars movie. There is a very fine balance between introducing something new and also keeping true to the lore. TLJ does this with great finesse. It is the kind of movie you want to re-watch immediately.\\n\\nThere was good character development while introducing a couple of new ones.\\n\\nSets and costumes were unique but also keeping with that Star Wars theme.\\n\\nTLJ met and exceeded my expectations. It is easy to set the bar high and if you are remotely interested in the Star Wars universe this one is not to be missed.\\n\\nhttp:\/\/theandrewchen.weebly.com\/moviereviews\/star-wars-the-last-jedi","true":true}
