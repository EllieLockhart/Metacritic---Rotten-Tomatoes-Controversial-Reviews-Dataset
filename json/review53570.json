Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Extremely disappointed. Possibly the worst movie of the entire franchise. Ryan (I know it's Rian\\, just  trying to help him spell his name correctly)\\, ruined Luke Skywalker's character. The Finn and Rose side plot was pointless. All the Skywalker mystery from the last 40 years is thrown out the window.\\nThe killing off of characters makes Game of thrones seem the student\\, not the master. Two movies in and we lose the most powerful good guy\\, most powerful bad guy\\, a high prized\\, super storm trooper with wolverine Armor\\, and half the Armada the first order was running. Oh\\, the good guys\\, after destroying the bad guy super cannon\/planet\\, apparently only have 3 big ships left in their fleet and a handful of fighters.\\nI would suggest not seeing it\\, but everyone will go and see it. At least take in a matinee and sneak in candy. Save yourself some money ;0)\\n\\nMay the Force leave Disney","true":true}
