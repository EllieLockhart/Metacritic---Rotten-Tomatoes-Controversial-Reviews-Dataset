Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"average movie at best. they did a good job on developing rey\\, Finn\\, and poe but kylo ren is a terrible bad guy. he's a p***y. not intimidating like darth Vader or cunning and cammanding like count dooku my favorite sith Lord. I will not buy on DVD nor do I have interest in seeing episode 9. I'm done with star wars","true":true}
