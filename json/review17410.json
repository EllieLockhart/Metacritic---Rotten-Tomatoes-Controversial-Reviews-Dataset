Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw Star Wars in 1977 as my 7th Birthday Present\\, and I have been a devoted fan since that day...\\nEvery following Star Wars Movie has reawakened the awe and excitement that the 7 year old child I once was had felt on that momentous occasion...\\nThe Last Jedi abused and destroyed my Inner Child...\\nThis travesty of a movie is an insult to any True Follower of the Star Wars Universe...\\nI will NEVER watch anything with the Star Wars name attached in future...\\nThanks For Nothing Disney\\, I will NEVER forgive you for this...","true":true}
