Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cant give 0 stars but god that was a HORIBLE movie. The best visuals made no sense and what made sense was boring. Cant be that hard to make a single god fight scene that makes sense without mistakes or at least only small ones\\, I mean George Lucas managed to do it soooo","true":true}
