Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"John Williams' overwhelming symphonic soundtrack and some badass visual effects make up for a film that has as many plot holes as the moons of Tatooine: Why did the rebellion not deactivate their tracking system once and for all? When did Leia learn to use the force? Is Rey the Last Jedi after only one lesson? Why did Phasma appear for just two minutes? If Rey can recognize Ren's whereabouts\\, shouldn't Kylo Ren be able to identify Rey's Location? If Snoke made the astral connection possible\\, shouldn't he know where Skywalker is? Can anyone use the force\\, including plants? Why does Snoke look like Hugh Hefner? Should Hux have sent the Tie fighters to destroy the rebellion when he had the chance? They had cannons with enough power to destroy a planet\\, but they are totally useless against the rebel fleet just because they were too far? THEY ARE RIGHT THERE\\, IN FRONT OF YOU!!!!","true":true}
