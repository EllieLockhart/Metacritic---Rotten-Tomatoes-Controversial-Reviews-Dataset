Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's like the writers didn't know what to do with Finn and Poe's storyline while they attempted to develop the Luke Ren and Rey main plot. So they wrote a list of things they thought the audience wanted to see (lightsaber duel with Rey and Ren fighting together\\, Chewy saving the Day in the millinium falcon\\, blue milk\\, Poe learning a lesson about leadership\\, a cool rebel ring to sell\\, Finn fighting Brianne of Tarth and lots of others.)\\nAnd then tried (and failed) to make up a logical plot that tied it all together. \\nToo many illogical solutions to storyline problems. Didn't think it could get worse than the force awakens\\, but definitely wrong. Ruining Star Wars.","true":true}
