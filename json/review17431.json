Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw the original Star Wars in 1977 at the age of 11.  I am a woman so this is not a man bashing the film.   The magic is gone. Luke was treated so badly. Wanting to kill his nephew is the moment when they jumped the shark.  Rey is just a boring Mary Sue. The only interesting thing about her  was the mind link with Kylo","true":true}
