Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great visuals but that's it basicaly. Too many unanswered questions\\, too much stupid behavior and I realy hate what they did with the \\\"classic\\\" characters. On top of that\\, the tone feels a bit strange from time to time and a lot of it was recycled from old (and better) Star Wars movies.\\nIf you love great VFX\\, this is your movie. If you love a god Star Wars story\\, skip this one.","true":true}
