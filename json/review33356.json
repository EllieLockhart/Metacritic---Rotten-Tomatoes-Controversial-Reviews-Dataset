Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sweeping away the past is a major theme in this chapter of the Star Wars saga; that so many older fans wish it had stronger ties to the past is very likely an unintended and somewhat delicious irony!
