Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When one puts aside some of the possible logical flaws that many try to use to point fingers at the plot\\, there is a great time to be had. Star Wars has never tried to be a technical\\, realistic space-opera setting and has always leaned more towards the Fantasy aspects. With this in mind\\, the story that plays out in this film and many of the moments with our main characters resonate very strongly. The largest flaw that brings this movie down a peg is the pacing issue when jumping between the three main stories being told. This does not pose enough of an issue to detract from the film's many powerful moments\\, several of which were quite literally jaw-dropping.","true":true}
