Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I like Star Wars and have enjoyed most of the films however this movie was boring\\, uninteresting and painful at times to watch\\, Why ? Characters lack the pull and connection you would feel with characters of the other movies\\, the story was boring and uninteresting after 2 hours I was glad to leave. Sorry to say but its true.","true":true}
