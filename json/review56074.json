Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many things wrong with this movie\\, I nearly walked out after 1:30 hours of watching\\, considering how politically correct\/badly written is was\\, for instance: 1) Feminism takes a front seat in everything with male-white characters either villains or failed heroes (ie Luke)\\, 2) the good guys are yet again\\, a rag-tag bunch of rebels when only 30 years prior\\, they literally conquered the galaxy... it almost made it seem like Disney NEEDED the good guys to be weaker\/victimized for them to be \\\"good\\\"\\, 3) family\\, heritage\\, and learning from your ancestors are useless; Ray just knows EVERYTHING the Jedi have to teach organically (ie. she's a Mary Sue)\\, and the takeaway from this movie is that heritage\\, family and knowledge is useless and should be ignored.  \\n\\nI could go on\\, but those are the general problems.  I'm not going to even get into the bad jokes-at-serious-points of the movie\\, the obsession with cuddly\/furry animals for no reason\\, the countless plot holes (Luke's magic dice\\, Lea's miraculous space flight\/spacecraft reentry without EVERYONE dying on board\\, no gravity in space-bombs\\, the fact that the space-chase kept the First Order the same distance from the rebel cruiser... but couldn't catch it\\, and of course\\, no one communicating with anyone else regarding things of obvious importance (ie. luke telling Lea is is buying her time to escape\\, or the vice admiral telling the pilot her plan when there are only 400 survivors of the rebellion).\\n\\nThe only redeeming factor in this movie\\, were the hyper-space jump collision (no sound in space\\, I liked it)\\, Lea's sick acting\\, and Finn.","true":true}
