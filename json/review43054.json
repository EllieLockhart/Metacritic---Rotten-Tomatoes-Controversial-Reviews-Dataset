Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was visually stunning\\, with some moments of intense action. But his imagery can't solve some issues that has the caracters in the story. It seems that the story was written having aside a focus group of millennial kids and a SJW people. That's a shame because the film before this one drop some hints about where the story was going. And any of that material wasn't used in this film. That's a shame the protagonist\\, a Mary-Sue one\\, It's a boring character. It doesn't help the audiences to finish liking the movie.","true":true}
