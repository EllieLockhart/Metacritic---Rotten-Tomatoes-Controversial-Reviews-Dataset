Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ would've been better served as a cartoon movie or some type standalone story. It didn't deserve to be an installment in the saga and did nothing to advance the story. 60-70% of this movie could've been covered in a few sentences of the opening crawl in a better Star Wars movie. \\n\\nIt seemed so disjointed from TFA and just threw out all the intrigue from that movie and made it meaningless. I think Rian Johnson tried to make the movie unpredictable instead of good. And top it all off\\, he ruined Luke's character and didn't really given an explanation of how he became that way. This is definitely 1 of the worst 3 SW movies for me.","true":true}
