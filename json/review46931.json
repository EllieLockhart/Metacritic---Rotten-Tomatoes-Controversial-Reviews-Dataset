Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Were there issues?  Sure.  When are there not?  As a life-long fan from the age of 4 in 1977\\, a fan who has read most all of the expanded universe (which is now NOT canon)\\, I thoroughly enjoyed Last Jedi.  Mark Hamill gives a great performance.  The humanity of Luke is true\\, as it always has been.  The development of the force is different\\, as it should be in beings with little guidance.  The main question I have is what to do with Leia?  Do NOT listen to the haters.  The vision might not be your own\\, but it is Star Wars.","true":true}
