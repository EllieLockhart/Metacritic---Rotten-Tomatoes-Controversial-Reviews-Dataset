Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its almost a perfect star wars movie. The comedy is actually very funny\\, luke is a badass despite being locked out from the force for MANY years\\, luke had a peaceful victory death instead of being defeated\\, they added a major twist with the main antagonist\\, the acting is outstanding\\, the visuals are gorgeous. The best bit for me is when the rebel ship flew into snokes ship at light speed. The visuals were jaw dropping.\\nAlso\\, I literally heard someone bitch that it was too funny\\, I mean really. Its only 15 minutes longer than other star wars movies\\, that's too long because? Just because the last Jedi didn't line up exactly how you wanted it to go doesn't make it a bad movie\\, seriously\\, the world doesn't revolve around you. I enjoyed a movie\\, shoot me.","true":true}
