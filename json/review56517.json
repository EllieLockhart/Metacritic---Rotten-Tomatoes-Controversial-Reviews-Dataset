Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"The greatest teacher\\, failure is.\\\" - Yoda TLJ. I don't want to see Episode 8 again\\, I will for the sake of coming to peace with it\\, but it feels like an obligation. What TLJ has demonstrated to me is that there's no point in getting attached to characters or questions or ideas in Star Wars because they're all going to be burned and thrown away in the end. AND that is the problem with this film\\, love it\\, like it\\, hate it\\, etc. TLJ shows that dedicated invested fans should simply not care or get emotionally attached in any way. It shows that established ideas and cherished characters don't matter; that fans' opinions and expectations don't matter; that continuity with previous instalments in the franchise doesn't matter; that logical consistency within the same 2.5-hour movie doesn't matter. TLJ broke me in a way that even the prequels couldn't and that's a goddamn shame.","true":true}
