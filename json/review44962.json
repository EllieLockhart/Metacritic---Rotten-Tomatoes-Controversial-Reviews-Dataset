{"101487":190528,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ugh\\, where to begin? First of all\\, I enjoy movies with strong female protagonists very much\\,  and I fully embrace diversity in media. I am forced to say this because anyone who points out how objectively awful this film is gets smeared as an evil sexist racist for some reason.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi was semi-coherent at best\\, with plot holes so gaping you could drive an AT-AT Walker through them. It seemed like it was made by someone who knew nothing about Star Wars. \\n\\nOne of the many irritating things about this film was that the Rebel fleet is CONSTANTLY complaining about how they are \\\"running out of fuel.\\\" This is mentioned at least 10 times\\, despite it never being an issue in any other Star Wars film. Remember when Han Solo was like\\, \\\"Hey Chewy\\, time to go gas up the Millennium Falcon?\\\" No\\, you don't because that never happened. \\n\\nAdditionally\\, Princess Leia (who for some reason is still not Queen Leia) and the Rebel \\\"leadership\\\" tolerates no less than three attempted mutinies by the same incompetent fighter pilot\\, with only minimal repercussions for the would-be mutineer. Because\\, you know\\, all of the most successful militaries tolerate insurrection and treason. \\n\\nI could go on all day\\, Yoda's ghost showing up and gleefully burning down the most sacred Jedi Temple and books; Leia somehow surviving in the vacuum of space; Luke attempting to murder a child he is supposed to be teaching. But that pretty much tells you all you need to know. \\n\\nBottom line: if you love\\, or even kinda like Star Wars\\, DO NOT SEE THIS FILM!","true":true}
