Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Far better than what I expected.  Elements of a really great Star Wars film\\, and some truly great moments make up for somewhat contrived plot (the ship chase seemed like a plot device) and perhaps unnecessary length. Most impressed with Mark Hamill\\, he did a great job with what he was given. I really don't understand all the negative audience reviews\\, overall a very good film\\, with incredible effects and great sound track. The director took some risks\\, and the end result is a worthy addition to the saga\\, even if the film upset some people by doing the unexpected eg. Luke being conflicted. The story may have been more complex\\, less black and white than what some fans were expecting but The Last Jedi is a very solid and entertaining ride start to finish\\, highly recommended.","true":true}
