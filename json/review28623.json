Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Proof if it were needed that Star Wars is to big to fail. Critics hang your heads in shame and don't be afraid of Disney\\, what on earth were you watching? 93%! Last Jedi is visually stunning yet utterly disappointing. The mystery and intrigue that Force Awakens gave us is shamefully trodden on or just forgotten. Gaping plot holes\\, unnecessary characters\\, a jog through space and a finger in the face to some well loved characters creates the first Star Wars film that makes you uncaring for what happens next. Last Jedi dropped the ball \\\"Han Solo\\\" better pick it up.","true":true}
