Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw this movie on the weekend and afterwards I really had to think about it because I had a lot of mixed feeling. After a lot of thinking I have determined that I liked this movie But it is not great. It was very different from the other Star Wars films and made a lot of bold choice in my opinion which I have to give credit for. There were a lot of things that were unexpected that when I thought about it\\, Some were good and some were not. I was Fine with the death of Snoke\\, But Luke's death was completely unjustified. All the acting in this film is very good\\, especially from Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher. The comedy would ahve worked better in a different movie. The visuals are of course very good. I really enjoyed the stuff with Rey and Luke. The only part for me that dragged the movie was the subplot with Finn and Rose. The Rose character I did not care for too much And I hated that she stopped Finn from saving the resistance.  Overall it was a good Star Wars film that I know some people will hate and I understand why but I can still find enjoyment from it.\\n\\n7.2\/10","true":true}
