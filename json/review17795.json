Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It felt like a CW hero show at some points. It felt like Spaceballs at others. Turned into a weird Casino Royale thing for a second. Then a magical horse\/camel race. Then add in some Family Guy jokes that go on 3beats too long. Turn Luke into The Grinch on Mt. Crumpit and Rey into Little Cindy Loo Who. Heard of FaceTime? Well Jedis have ForceTime. I'm not even going to discuss Leia and her ice zombie levitating through space flight. Oh and for the lifelong fans. Yoda shows up and declares all Jedi teaching and beliefs to be a real snooze and burns down the temple. But buy your kid a porg because they screech uncontrollably. Adorable.","true":true}
