Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Incredibly disappointing. I loved The Force Awakens and was so excited to see how TLJ answered the many questions it raised and further developed the relationships between its characters. Unfortunately\\, TLJ gave us a throwaway non-resolution of exactly one of those questions\\, and left the rest in the dust. The one good thing I can say about this movie is that it's very pretty\\, but Rian Johnson's truly baffling writing\/directing choices gave the whole thing about as much impact and emotional payoff as a poorly timed whoopee cushion. I had to duck out of the theater in the middle of a climactic scene because I couldn't stop laughing at how ridiculous it all was. Do yourself a favor and skip Episode 8\\, or if you really must see it\\, wait until you can rent it for $3 on Youtube.","true":true}
