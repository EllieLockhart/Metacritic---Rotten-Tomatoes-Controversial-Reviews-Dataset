Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am rating the movie for what I viewed\\, not on principle or any social ideology or even some form of protest\\, just as a movie in a franchise.  I thought it was a terrible mess of story telling and narrative. The Last Jedi felt like a poor filler episode of one's favorite sci-fi tv show.","true":true}
