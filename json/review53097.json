Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A terrible movie\\, made worse because the subject matter is beloved and has previously been excellent.  The movie drags.  The movie contains too many subplots\\, most of which do nothing to forward the story or develop the characters.  My one word review of this movie: betrayal.","true":true}
