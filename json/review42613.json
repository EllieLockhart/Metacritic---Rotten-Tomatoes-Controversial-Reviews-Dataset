Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was BAD. \\n\\nI'm not talking \\\"Prequels\\\" bad where it's sterile\\, flat and full of annoying characters and cheesy dialogue...\\n\\nI'm not even talking Force Awakens bad\\, where it was shallow fan service and basically a remake of the original Star Wars movie only with major plot holes.\\n\\nI mean bad to the point of completely misunderstanding the main character of Luke Skywalker; being tonally inconsistent to the extent of being part worst bits of Guardians of the Galaxy 2 and part worst bits of Revenge of the Sith; totally throwing out all the story set ups of the previous movie (thereby removing the entire reason for this film existing)\\, by being full of heavy handed social justice third wave feminist Marxism and and by being...boring.\\n\\nThat's right. Boring.\\n\\nLet me explain something- I was brought up to believe being bored is a sign of an unintelligent mind. I was literally not allowed to say \\\"I'm bored\\\" in the presence of my mother. I have worked jobs that included a 16 hour shift as a security guard at a deserted wind farm on top of a mountain\\, dishwasher at a restaurant and janitor mopping the floors of an abbatoir. At no point was I bored.  I also enjoy listening to lectures and audiobooks on obscure topics. I read textbooks for fun. I didn't think it was possible to bore me.\\nBut most of this movie bored me senseless. I checked my watch multiple times.  \\n \\nFor a Star Wars movie to be boring is unforgivable.  \\n\\nThe bits that didn't bore me were totally cringeworthy. The opening scene in this film had me literally drop my jaw open in disbelief at how awful it was. I couldn't believe what I was seeing.\\n\\nI'm not going to go through the plot- others have done that. Suffice it to say it is literally a hate letter to Star Wars fans in the same way Ghostbusters 2016 was a hate letter to Ghostbusters fans.\\n\\nThe critics in this case are irrelevant. These are not art house sci fi films\\, they are popcorn adventure movies riding on the name of a beloved trilogy. They must have continuity\\, respect and be entertaining.\\n\\nThe only positives? Mark Hamill does a great job with the limited material he has\\, and the scenes with him\\, and with the wonderful Carrie Fisher are touching in spite of this movie\\, not because of it. They put this review from zero stars to half a star. The characters of Rey and Kylo are less obnoxious than in the Force Awakens\\, but the overall tone is one of disrespect and hatred of the previous films. \\n\\nThis film was made by people who DESPISE Star Wars and traditional Star Wars fans. \\n\\nIf you want to know what sort of psychopaths made this film- Finn and the new Jar Jar Binks\\, a girl called Rose\\, go to the planet of evil rich white men and end up meeting some cgi horse\/dog creatures used for racing\\, and some small children held as slaves. At the end of this pointless\\, boring\\, annoying side plot\\, they end up setting the horses free and leaving the slave children chained up as they fly away into the sunset patting themselves on the back.\\nUrgh.\\n\\nDo not see this movie\\, and do what I'm going to do- boycott the next one.\\nThe creeps at Disney don't deserve our money.","true":true}
