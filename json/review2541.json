Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A well contained story (beginning middle and end) has been transformed into a never ending cash cow.\\n\\nThere's a lot to like in this movie.  \\n- Great Visuals\\n- Tension\\n- Micro plot (side stories)\\n\\nBut it is wholly let down by the fact that it's plot goes NOWHERE.  That trademark yellow text at the start of the film literally tells you how the film FINISHES!  In getting from nowhere to nowhere it steals a lot of tropes from The Return of the Jedi and Empire Strikes back to a lesser extent.  It tells a story you didn't see coming and writes yet more characters out.\\n\\nBut at it's heart this film has precisely one function.  It deliberately changes core principles so that the saga will never end.  That's right folks.  The rebels will NEVER win because Disney don't wont to end the saga.  In the space of a single film we can all abandon all hope of victory.\\n\\nI so wanted to like this film going in.  In the week since I saw  it\\, it's just got worse in my memory and not sat well.\\n\\nSuch a pity.","true":true}
