Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film takes a dump on the lore\\, history\\, characters\\, fans and films(1-7) of all  that came before it . It answers no questions posed by the last film. Instead opting to bait and switch the audience at every turn\\, with no story or character pay off. \\n\\nI can't believe I defended TFA 2 years ago now\\,. From Han going out like a punk and against the Mary Sue bull. I guess they were right all along. But this film(TLJ) flushed all that setup from TFA down the toilet. The Last Jedi is like a video game set on easy mode with cheats on (force powers use to be earned).  Did Snoke finish Kylo's training? nope\\, Did Luke train Rey?\\, nope. Now the force works like a participation trophy.\\n\\nThe entire premise of this film is based on a capital ship being tracked and running out of gas in 18 hours \\,seriously??? Capital ships have reactors\\, you know like a nuclear submarine. Didn't think that would have been a problem. But it is. Here's another problem you just lost this fan. gg","true":true}
