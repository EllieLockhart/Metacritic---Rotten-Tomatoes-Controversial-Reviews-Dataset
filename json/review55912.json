Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"* Reys past?: WHO CARES!Audience question \/ Studio Response...\\n\\n\t* Snoke?: WHO CARES!!\\n\t* Phasma?: WHO CARES!!\\n\t* The history\\, mystery\\, and magic of the ancient Jedi Order?: WHO CARES!!\\n\t* Benicio Del toros character?: WHO CARES!!\\n\t* Laura Derns Character?: WHO CARES!!\\n\t* Reducing Poe Dameron to a moron: WHO CARES!!\\n\t* Reducing Luke to a whining man baby: WHO CARES!!\\n\t* Send Rose and Fin off on a completely arbitrary and confusing quest that proves a waste\\, then force them to kiss: WHO CARES!!\\n\t* Hanging out on \\\"flashback island\\\" with sad Luke\\, having nothing to do but milk creatures and revist the same flashback?: WHO CARES!!\\n\t* Making the Vader Arechtype (Kylo) a whining man baby - to the point he is not menacing in any way (are we sure he isn't Lukes son?): WHO CARES!!!\\n\t* Feeling like you just watched a movie that walked back everything you loved about the previous episode: WHO CARES!!!\\n\t* 1.5 Hours of waiting for a ships shield to go down while being chased by a Star Destroyer isn't fun: WHO CARES!!!\\n\t* Strong central plot built around friendship\\, adventure\\, mystery\\, and maybe a bit of romance: WHO CARES!!\\n\t* Strong ongoing character arks\/development for the new cast introduced in ep. 7: WHO CARES!!\\n\t* Instead\\, a movie that feels like a bubbly\\, incoherent\\, JJ Abrahams Star Trek movie: WHO CARES!!\\n\t* Ignoring Lukes growth and character ark from episodes 4-6: WHO CARES!!\\n\t* Make a swashbuckling space adventure in the spirit of old serials\\, without forcefully injecting poltics: WHO CARES!!\\n\t* Be more specific?
