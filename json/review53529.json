Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Entertaining? Sure. But Rian Johnson has slapped 30 years of film making in the face to make what he thinks is a \\\"dramatically compelling\\\" film. The poor choices in this film have actually made me mad. Character arcs are wasted\\, subverted\\, destroyed for comic relief or killed off. Questions are tossed aside or given lazy theme driven answers. Let us ignore that Johnson only moved the timeline forward about 28 hours in a film-universe who's trilogies span a decade at a time. And for what? Were are our characters? What is different at the end? Kylo is still conflicted\\, Rey still doesn't know her place in the Universe\\, Finn is still chasing after Rey\\, Resistance is still on the ropes and the First order is still technologically & numerically superior. Thanks for the movie about saving fuel!\\n\\nNo. You do not get to spit on over 30 years of story and character development so that you can be a witty & contrarian film maker who makes movies for film school professors. This is an established universe with a millennia of cannon that you just spun on it's head for the sake of 'dramatic and compelling cinema.' \\n\\nTL;DR - JJ Abrams is going to die of a stroke trying to fix episode 9. Abomination. Heresy.","true":true}
