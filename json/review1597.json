Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a longtime fan of Star Wars\\, this \\\"film\\\" is a horrible addition to the series. Poor plot\\,  weak characters and  numerous plot holes made this already too long movie (2.5 hours) a grind to watch. Its obvious no one had any ideas for a real story since the writing was so lazy. It didn't line up with or even Acknowledge the previous movie.","true":true}
