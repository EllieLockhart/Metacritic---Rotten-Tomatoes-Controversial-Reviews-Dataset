Tore down Joel that had such a story behind him. Then in a span of 2 minutes\\, killed. In the first hour of playing this game. Abby sought revenge\\, and she got it. You play Ellie\\, who also seeks revenge killing everyone who was involved. Not only does she fail in that quest\\, but the devs thought it was sort of a good life lesson that revenge is bad. In the end you have Ellie who finally finds Abby after all that carnage\\, and let's her go.So in total you basically play Abby more than Ellie. I think Naughty Dog wanted us to feel bad for Abby to justify what she did to a beloved character.After the game ended you realise Joel is dead\\, Tommy's marriage ends\\, Dina breaks up with Ellie\\, and now she doesn't have access to a guitar which was a big story highlight of the game.....\u2026 Expand","true":true}
