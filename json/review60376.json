TLoU2 is a journey of emotions. It's the best I can say about the game. I was happy\\, sad\\, depressed\\, angry\\, pissed off\\, I cried a lot and finally\\, amazed. Ellie's journey after Joel's killer is magnificent. The dialogues\\, the gameplay\\, all the characters involved\\, the soundtrack\\, just perfect. The ending is exciting\\, the scene in which Ellie sees Joel when she is about to kill Abby is heartbreaking and strong at the same time because we see that in her last conversation with Joel\\, there is still a resentment and it was this feeling that keep her going on her journey of revenge. It is interesting to see the consequences of their thirst for revenge\\, perceptible to the good viewer. it's an excellent game\\, a wonderful and courageous story and an epic ending. Congratulations and I sincerely hope you give us a Part 3.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
