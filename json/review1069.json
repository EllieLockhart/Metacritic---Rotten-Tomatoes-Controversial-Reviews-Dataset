Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An overly long\\, jaggedly edited rehash of the 2nd act of empire strikes back with beats from jedis thrown room scene thrown in for good measure. It's saving graces are the links between luke rey\\, snoke and kylo and the interplay and misdirection used between these characters throughout. All locations apart form the island are lacklustre and finns subplot was pretty much unwatchable which is a real shame.. he needed some character growth and a reset to his previous arc and yet another third act sacrifice just doesn't make me invested in his character. THIS FILM DOES NOT FEEL LIKE STARWARS","true":true}
