Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Magnificent work of artists\\, excellent graphics and camera work\\, this ends the movie's pluses. The rest of the film is a boring\\, dull\\, and most importantly stupid and illogical rubbish\\, which parasitizes the successful franchise.","true":true}
