Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It takes a lot of guts to make a movie you believe in. Rian Johnson did just that. While TLJ isn't perfect\\, it is much better than people are giving it credit for. From reading a lot of the fan reviews\\, it just strikes me that people are just finding reasons to hate.  In many instances on RotTom\\, I don't care what critics say or think. I make decisions as to how I'm going to spend my ticket money. I say this because sometimes the critics are off by a wide margin. I check the fan reviews because most people don't have a dog in the fight (other than their own entertainment) the fans were wrong on this movie. It's striking out on it's own (which isn't bad) and it was well cast. I encourage anyone who reads this to actually watch the movie if you love the Star Wars films. Make your own decision. Rant about it online (just like me)","true":true}
