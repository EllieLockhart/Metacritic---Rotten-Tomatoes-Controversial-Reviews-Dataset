I have literally been dying for game like this since probably Friday the 13th for NES. But one with graphics and gameplay like Heavy Rain and Until Dawn definitely delivers what I was hoping for.\rSpoiler: Except for the fact that I was hoping for a slasher game like Heavy Rain with Friday the 13th gameplay. Until Dawn turning into another game where you fight off monsters is a slight disappointment. There's enough games like that already. However\\, Until Dawn is one of the best of those games.\rWhile if you don't like the ending and you got your favorite characters killed. You can replay the whole game or just a couple of chapters to try and get a better ending.\rHere's to hoping the company makes an actual slasher game with similar game play in the future. I'd pre-order that in a second. This game was still amazing either way.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
