Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just hated it. Wanted this movie to make some sense of the very big problems in The Force Awakens. Nope\\, just throws them away unexplained. Then throws away the main character of the series. Then redefines much of the lore of the series. If they wanted a new saga that would have been great\\, but don't hijack an existing series and then send a big FU to the fans and the point of the series. Even the new parts of the series don't agree on the direction. I have no interest in the third movie now\\, and Disney has lost me for the rest of what they have planned.","true":true}
