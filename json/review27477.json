Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall cringe worthy episode in the Star Wars legacy\\, an absolute disgrace to the core characters. Hamill and driver are amazing but the cheesy overly ridiculous antics and forced humour really hurt the movie. The opening scene with the characters Hux and Poe was awful\\, the casino scenes were a waist\\, BB-8 shooting coins at security guards was childish antics. To build up what was deemed to be a beautiful script and something close in scope to the original Empire strikes back was a mistake\\, this movie was ridiculous and left me trying to understand how this movie could have been made by a fan of the franchise. A real disappointment!!!!!!!!!!!!!! How in the world did the production approve of the look of Yoda. Awful!","true":true}
