Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My expectations were low since the beginning\\, but this movie has reached a new low. The story is inconsistent\\, unnecessary long and subplots are useless. The characters are incoherent with the previous movie and Luke Skywalker is completely OOC. The score\\, that was among the best parts of the Star Wars saga\\, is flat\\, plain and you don't notice any of the themes. This is what happens when you let a trilogy to be written by different screenplayers and directors. Let the screenplay be written by Star Wars authors. I'm a huge fan and it's very painful to see this movie.","true":true}
