Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"great addition to the Star Wars universe! People are too difficult to please these days. there's not much more I could ask for in a Star Wars movie. it hit all the right beats\\, has phenomenal character arcs and some great throwbacks to the original trilogy. the acting is great\\, the direction is solid\\, the jokes appropriately timed and funny and great visual effects. a movie should be judged on how it makes you feel at a gut level. and this movie\\, in every way felt like a Star Wars movie.
