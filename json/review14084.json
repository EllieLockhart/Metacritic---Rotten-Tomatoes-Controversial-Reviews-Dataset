Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you're into movies that are a bloated mess of destroying beloved characters and jokes so completely unaware of the world we live in (a black man being tazered until he passes out?) they make people physically uncomfortable\\, boy is this the movie for you.\\n\\nFor those who have somehow never watched any Star Wars movies from the original trilogy to the more recent 'Force Awakens'\\, the sheer gravity of how pathetic the Last Jedi is will be partially lost on you. The awkward humor\\, bloated runtime and sometimes shoddy pacing however will not.\\n\\nThose who have watched any previous Star Wars film\\, either casually or as a die hard fan\\, are in for a much worse time. Rian almost systematically rejects every character trait and arc of the preceding movies\\, to communicate a point that is.... Unclear. He either wants us to sympathize with Kylo Ren\\, the character who\\, within the first few moments of the Force Awakens\\, is torturing a man. Or\\, he wants to reinforce what the whole of the Force Awakens\\, and Han Solo's death\\, already made clear- that Kylo Ren\\, even if he feels a call to the light\\, is a bad dude.\\n\\nTo this end\\, we get to meet a cast of what must be new characters\\, because they have no bearing on any previous iterations of themselves. \\n\\nRey\\, who is equal parts a hardened survivor and a compassionate hero\\, was last seen by audiences moments away from murdering Kylo Ren as she calls him a monster. Somewhat inexplicably\\, they hold hands and tremble a lot in the Last Jedi. \\n\\nLuke\\, whose character is defined by his compassion and spares Darth Vader himself\\, is now the kind of guy who would try to murder his own nephew and padawan\\, and is therefore to blame for everything Kylo does henceforth. \\n\\nKylo Ren\\, who we're pretty sure is in his thirties\\, is repeatedly referred to as a 'boy'\\, in what I can only hope is some tongue in cheek reference to the way the media infantilizes and excuses white male mass murderers with ties to fascist organisations. \\n\\nPoe\\, who had been so passionate\\, caring and capable in the Force Awakens\\, is a suspicious and insubordinate dickhead who is directly responsible for the death of his own people\\, and is punished in the narrative with slaps\\, a demotion\\, and the heroic death of the main source of his suspicion\\, amounting to more punishment than Kylo Ren himself receives. \\n\\nFinn\\, an actual storm-trooper and former soldier of the First Order\\, who grows into a hero through his love for his friends and his conviction that the light and kindness is the path he wants to follow\\, despite his brainwashing\\, is mostly sidelined\\, humiliated\\, made fun of\\, and robbed of what could have been a symbolic and triumphant defeat of Phasma by his own hand.\\n\\nSomewhere between all this there's some cool cgi\\, a very uncomfortable milking scene\\, and admittedly a banging sound track\\, but when the very heart of Star Wars -its characters and themes- is entirely butchered\\, it's hard to care.","true":true}
