Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At this point\\, there's a ton of other reviews that verbalize my many issues with this movie far better than I could. I can say that thanks to this movie\\, I really could care less about where this story goes and what happens to these pointless characters. I left the theater Thursday night opening weekend and felt embarrassed for being so in love with this series for so many years.","true":true}
