Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"RIP Star Wars. i have no idea what i just watched. huge star wars fan growing up. was ultra excited to see this one as EP7 left way too many questions unanswered. this movie did nothing to answer those questions and instead created more. a huge mess from start to finish. felt more like Star Trek than it did Star Wars. this franchise will never get another penny from me or my entire family going forward.
