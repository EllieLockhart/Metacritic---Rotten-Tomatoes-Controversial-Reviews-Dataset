Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw The last jedi with 2 other people\\, all Stars Wars fans\\, WE ALL Hated it. The movie NEVER develops characters like Snoke or Capt Phasma before they are quickly disposed of! The hour and half \\\"O.J.\\\" slow chase was RIDICULOUS!!! and anyone who tries to defend that is trying too hard!! We wanted to leave about half thru\\, but stuck it out in hopes that it would end well\\,....it didn't ! Luke was wasted\\,.....before being disposed of and the rebels were so incompetent that you were happy that there were only a handful left alive at the end!!","true":true}
