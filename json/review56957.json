Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst movie from the saga this far.. destroyed the achievements of the characters from the original trillogy; plots with sub plots with sub plots - OMG. the luke character was destroyed the story portraid him in such a way that made it unbelievable.\\n\\nMaybe slow a bit down and tell us who is snoke\\, where does the first order come from...a crushing blow was given to the first order in theprev movie amd now they are so powerfull again..... what was the point of theprev movie.\\n\\nwrite a better\\, deeper story with relationships that develop with ti\\,e.\\n\\ni wish we could delete this movie and start again.","true":true}
