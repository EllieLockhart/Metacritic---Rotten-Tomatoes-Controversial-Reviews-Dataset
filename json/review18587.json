Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It looked pretty\\, it's sad that that is all I could say about it without being negative. I never\\, ever thought I'd say this but I can honestly find more positive things to say about the prequels. This is just a shame.","true":true}
