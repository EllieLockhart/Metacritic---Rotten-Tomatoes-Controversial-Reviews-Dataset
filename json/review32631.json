Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a thoroughly enjoyable film with great moments that outshine some really questionable choices that ultimately keep this movie from being an all time classic in the franchise. When The Force Awakens released it focused on recapturing the magic and adventure that was lost with the prequels. With Episode 8 though\\, Rian Johnson throws everything you thought you knew out the window. Everything with Luke\\, Rey\\, Kylo\\, and Snoke were brilliant. Learning more about the force and seeing how these characters react to each other are some of the best moments in the franchise. Everything else though is extremely hit or miss. I enjoyed seeing Poe and Finn again\\, but the whole resistance plot just seemed rehashed and cliche. Also the attempt at humor is so overbearing at some points and just uanessacry and other times it works extremely well. The Last Jedi is filled with incredibly high high's and some shallow lows.","true":true}
