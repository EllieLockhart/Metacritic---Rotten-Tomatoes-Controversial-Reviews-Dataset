Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It had some really nice moments but both main arcs of the plot are rendered pointless. Throw away characters get far too much screen time. Might have the best fight scene of the franchise. Beyond that it just misses the mark too many times - by the end it felt like this should be the last of the new trilogy. Go see it for yourself but o would keep expectations low.","true":true}
