Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One word... EPIC! Starwars Episode 8 The last Jedi goes where no other star wars film has\\, taking huge risks that pay off nicely. Cinematography was wonderful\\, story excellent and emotional\\, acting solid\\, and action intense! The only downfall came in one particular sequence for me which I felt to be a bit off putting. But for the most part it is just a blemish in a shining diamond. The Last Jedi is the best of this new trilogy and possibly of all time. 4.5\/5","true":true}
