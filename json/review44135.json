Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To be honest I have seen this movie twice now and been a hard core star wars fan. I have read a lot of the legion books and canon books. Watch the cartoons and all the movies. The first time seeing this I would of rated it a 2 out of 5 because I was confused and felt odd after leaving. Now seeing it twice a lot of it makes sense why they did the story the way they did it... There is some parts where filming was not great and parts of the story I did not like. But the music\\, most of the filming and most of the story after seeing it twice I enjoyed. So I will give it a 4.5 out of 5 stars. I would tell people to keep a open mind with the story and if you don't like it the first time give it a second chance.","true":true}
