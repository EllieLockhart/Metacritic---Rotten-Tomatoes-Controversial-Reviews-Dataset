Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is easily one of the worst science fiction movies I've ever seen\\, and to be perfectly honest it ruined Star Wars for me. I have been a fan of the series since I was four\\, and watched every movie\\, repeatedly\\, until Last Jedi...this movie ruined the series\\, ruined continuity\\, ruined the setting and insulted the audience's intelligence on so many levels it's almost tear-jerking. Ironically this was called Last Jedi\\, having driven away most of the fanbase from the series.","true":true}
