Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This could be a good movie\\, just not a Star Wars movie.\\nI understand trying to bury the past and focus onto the new characters\\, but you do not do that by TRASHING all over the most important character in the whole Star Wars universe.\\nI did not recognize that Luke. There is no way that the Luke every knew from the original trilogy would behave like that. He is not Obi Wan\\, nor Yoda to choose to run away from his problems or mistakes.\\n\\nJust... no.\\n\\nAnd the forces jokes. Oh my lord\\, how bad they were. The Canto Bight should have been axed completely. It added ZERO to the story. Also\\, the \\\"space chase\\\" is one of the most dumb things I have witnessed on screen. The Kylo\/Rey part is the only good thing coming out of this travesty.\\nVisually its a good movie (except the Superman Leia part... that just felt so wrong)\\, but the story falls apart all over the place. Everything from TFA was thrown out basically. Snoke? who cares... Knights of Ren? What are those? Rey's parents? LOL joke's on you.\\n\\nJust terrible.","true":true}
