Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The term \\\"bold\\\" is quite apt to describe this movie\\, though the word is not necessarily a good thing\\, as is clearly evident in TLJ. With attempts at forced humour\\, strange character choices\\, unnecessary added side-plots\\, dropped plotlines\\, additional characters\\, Leias Man of Steel moment\\, Force texting romance scenes\\, etc etc.  So many bold choices\\, few of which actually produce good results.\\n\\nCons: Just... the movie itself... My god. It's like a Star Wars version of the Room. \\n\\nPros: Some of the action scenes were pretty decent.","true":true}
