You wander from setpiece to setpiece\\, give the inputs which are very basic and move on. Then the typical cover shooter arena or platforming part are inbetween to \\\"diversify\\\" the gameplay which only is tedious after so much games from the same developer.\rA lot of things happen out of stupidety of the characters which is often a result of bad writing. Characters are very flat and only few have signs of development.\rPersonally I\u00b4d say if you\u00b4ve played the last of us\\, you\u00b4ve played the second installment with the main difference that you control a character which you probably can\u00b4t really get into.\rOnly good thing are visuals\\, which is not enough to make a interactive movie into a game\\, but needed to sell this product to a wider audience.\rIf you have the urge to \\\"play\\\" it\\, I\u00b4d say ask a friend to borrow\\, wait until a sale or a used copy because paying 60$ for a tortue porn movie is a bit much.\rJust a friendly insider warning\\, if a game has too much positive ratings\\, there\u00b4s something fishy going on.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
