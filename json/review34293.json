Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the absolute worst movie i have ever seen.  virtually no plot\\, more questions than answers\\, like how is there gravity in deep space? how did they mess up characters that have been well establish for literally decades? how did anyone forget that space is a vacuum and how did it not come into play in various scenes throughout the movie? overall im extremely disappointed that i spent any money or time on this movie and i will not be seeing any more Star Wars films in the future.","true":true}
