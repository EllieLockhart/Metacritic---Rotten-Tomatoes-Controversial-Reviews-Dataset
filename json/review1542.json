Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a life long Star Wars fan and someone who was incredibly excited for this movie after the wonderful new beginnings of The Force Awakens\\, I could not have been more disappointed. In my opinion the people behind this movie fundamentally did not understand the characters they were working with. There was no love for the story\\, lore\\, and characters that all of us love. The director seemed to just want to create cheap twist that completely detailed the entire franchise. I have never felt so much disappointment leaving a theater and hopefully I will never have to feel that way again leaving a Star Wars movie\\, but the issues that this movie has created narratively seem too great to be fix in a meaningful way with just one movie to go.
