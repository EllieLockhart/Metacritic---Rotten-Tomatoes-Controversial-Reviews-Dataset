Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was an insult to Starwars as a whole. They ruined\\, and disrespected Luke Skywalker's character. This movie pushes SJW culture at the detriment of the fans\\, and the franchise. It is ruined by plot holes\\, bad writing\\, boring characters\\, and a directionless plot. The films main character (Rey) is the most boring\\, and difficult to connect with out of all the characters. Rey has everything handed to her on a silver platter in these movies\\, and is also just good at everything for no reason. There are a number of mistakes with the filming that I can't be bothered to go over with this quick review. The bottom line is that this movie is not made for Starwars fans. If you love Starwars like I do\\, then don't watch this garbage film","true":true}
