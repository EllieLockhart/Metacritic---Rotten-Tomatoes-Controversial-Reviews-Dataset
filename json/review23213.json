Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it! I cannot fathom how anyone could dislike this movie unless you go in wanting to hate it. Best Luke Skywalker performance of the entire saga. Just because the story doesn\u2019t go the way you want it\\, doesn\u2019t mean the movie is bad.","true":true}
