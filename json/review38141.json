Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"The systematic destruction of the world and of the rules of the world\\\" - Richard Nokes. Good quote that sums up some of my feelings of this movie. The movie somehow made the previously movies worse and overall my worst movie experience of the last year. In fact\\, I wish I never saw this and still had the imagination  of Luke being a different character.","true":true}
