Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing. Petulant Luke never gets back to his old form.  There are many Tangents.  There is the token Love triangle with Finn.  Did the slow anticlimactic chase between the rebel flag ship and the first order fleet seem illogical to anyone else?  If you had overwhelming numbers like the first order\\, wouldn't you just send in ships from other directions since your prey is moving predictably in a straight line?  Odd that there is such a discrepency between critic and audience scores - are critics being paid off or something.  I could see a 75%\\, but 93% to 56% something smells fishy.","true":true}
