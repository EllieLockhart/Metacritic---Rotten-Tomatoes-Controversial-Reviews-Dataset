Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was disappointed by TLJ. The stakes weren't raised in any way. Both sides\\, the Resistance and First Order\\, were incompetent and defied any logic or strategy in execution of their plans. My take with the elephant in the room...I didn't mind Luke's death but where was his goodbye to Rey and Leia? There was no 'The Force will be with you' and the movie ended just as abruptly.","true":true}
