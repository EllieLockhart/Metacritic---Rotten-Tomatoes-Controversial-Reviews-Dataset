Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"after the trailer I had really high expectations\\, but man\\, what a disappointment The Last Jedi was. So many plot holes\\, terrible treatment of Finn\\, Luke\\, Snoke\\, all the droids\\, Chewbacca\\, and more. The Casino side story was poorly done and completely unnecessary. It had a couple decent action sequences\\, but the negatives far\\, far outweigh any positive aspects of this one. \\n\\nIt's like a person going to a Basketball game and after halftime\\, a new coach substitutes in\\, brings in new players and proceeds to play CalvinBall midgame\\, throwing out all the rules of the game and adding newfangled rules on the fly. Some may find it exciting\\, but many people expecting to enjoy a game of basketball will be sorely upset at the results. \\n\\nTruly a wasted opportunity.","true":true}
