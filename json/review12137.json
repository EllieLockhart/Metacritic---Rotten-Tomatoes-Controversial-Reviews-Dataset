Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a huge Star Wars fan that looks at the original trilogy as the gold standard and I really liked Rogue One.  However\\, my expectation of \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" going into it based on the trailer and on \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" was this was going to be a hot mess.  And it didn't disappoint.  What a convoluted mess.  This is the worst movie in the franchise in my opinion.  I expected more from Disney but I guess what they gave us is a Disney movie\\, not a Star Wars movie.  I felt this was dumbed down and I had no idea what the plot was.  It just felt like a bunch of strung together side quests that left me shaking my head\\, \\\"what was the point of that.\\\" At this point\\, I'm not even invested in any of the characters\\, which are flat and uninspiring.  The only reason I am giving it half a star is because of Carrie Fisher's performance and it had some nice visuals.  But I find that visual directors make terrible story tellers.","true":true}
