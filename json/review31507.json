Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some truly epic moments here.  The best interactions are between Rey and Kylo.\\n\\nBut.... much like The Force Awkens\\, Rian Johnson pulls a bait and switch with Luke Skywalker.  He relegates him to a coward on an Island\\, who's eventual entrance into the fray is smoke and mirrors.\\n\\nI was stunned and very disappointed with the treatment of the Character and waste of such good options.\\n\\nOther than that for the most part it was very solid.","true":true}
