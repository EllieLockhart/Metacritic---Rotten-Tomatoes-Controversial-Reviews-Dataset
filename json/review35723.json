Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"The Last Jedi\\\" is a visually stunning film\\, but where it succeeds in execution\\, it falls short in virtually every other aspect. Rian Johnson has taken Star Wars in a completely different direction than we were expecting from the end of \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" and it was not the direction many of us wanted. Through it's heavy use of Ex Machina's\\, and drawn out\/redundant story arcs\\, The Last Jedi proves to be nostalgic cash grab by explaining physically impossible feats with \\\"The Force\\\" and shattering the mystical power's defined limits as we came to know them in previous films. Is \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" a bad film? No\\, it delivers intense action\\, and excellent acting. Is it a bad Star Wars film? Yes. I would rather watch \\\"The Phantom Menace\\\" than \\\"The Last Jedi.\\\" If there is one thing I will thank Rian Johnson for\\, it is for showing me how much I actually appreciate the Prequel Trilogy.","true":true}
