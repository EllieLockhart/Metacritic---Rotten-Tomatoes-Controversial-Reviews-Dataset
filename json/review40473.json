Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the first time of my life I get out of a movie angry.  Why the fuck did Disney choose a noname such as Rian Johnson for a movie as important as this ?  Fuck you Disney!  Failing SW8 is failing SW9 at the same time.  You ruined one of the best things in life.","true":true}
