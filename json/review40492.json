Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the most incoherent of the Star Wars movies\\, with possible exception of Lucas's meandering meaningless plot lines over a decade ago. Really thought the last two installments\\, out of Lucas's hands\\, were very good and tightly written with compelling stories. I had new hope.  There are so many plot failures in this\\, it just gives me a headache thinking about them.","true":true}
