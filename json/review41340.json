Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a like or hate movie I do respect it's a Star Wars movie. Even if has bad ideals\\, doesn't explain anything from  Force Awaken!  This movie follows every Star Wars trilogy pattern episode 5 and 2 have been the worse of all Star Wars this does too. I not going to the detail for spoiler reasons. it just have huge problem with lore.","true":true}
