Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Este filme \u00e9 incr\u00edvel e ao mesmo tempo desapontador\\, impressionante como \u00e9 um mix de sentimento. Creio que deveriam ter explorado mais os vil\u00f5es\\, mortes sem necessidade\\, piadas sem proposito\\, side quests fracas\\, personagens e hist\u00f3rias vazias\\, etc. entretanto o visual e algumas cenas s\u00e3o realmente memor\u00e1veis. Infelizmente acho que leva a saga para um caminho bem diferente que o JJ deixou no final de 2015\\, na ocasi\u00e3o n\u00e3o via a hora de chegar Dez\/2017\\, por\u00e9m este\\, n\u00e3o deixou o sentimento de \\\"chega logo EP IX!\\\".","true":false}
