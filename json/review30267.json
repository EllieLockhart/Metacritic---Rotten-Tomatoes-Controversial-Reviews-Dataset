Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw this movie - wished I hadn't.  Do not see this dross. Written by clueless agenda driven hacks. Totally ignores what went before and invites you to believe in hollow pointless characters. \\n\\nZero story or character development and reinvents old characters in such a manner as to portray them as guileless miscreants.  New characters are vaguely introduced and imbued with tremendous gravitas that requires all viewers to disengage their brains in order to accept these characters. \\n\\nFinally any review encouraging repeat viewings is an obvious ploy by Disney employees and accolytes attempting to bolster ticket sales. \\n\\nChina hated it for good reason - it's crap. They didn't reject TFA or Jumanji or ROGUE one but this detritus was pulled from cinemas after 1 week. PULLED from cinemas in China after flopping miserably. \\n\\nStay away.","true":true}
