Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall it was a terrible movie. Rey got no training\\, fin and rose had really no point to the story\\, Luke Skywalkers character development was total shit\\, Kylo Ren jus had another 2 temper tantrums this film\\, why was Snoke even there cuz idk he served no point\\, the end battle was just Hoth all over again\\, i cant comprehend why Admeral Holdo waited until half the resistance was destroyed before stopping the first order fleet\\, they could've done a  lot better job having Leia use the force rather than IM MERRY POPPINS YALL\\, for the love god kill those damn penguins\\, the opening scene with the terrible joke really ruins the overall tone of the opening\\, Poh Dumbass did nothing but try fuck shit up and yet is praised for fucking shit up....why\\, the momentt  luke joked with ray was off putting\\, how didd Rey magically escape  from the ship\\, why even bother having Brienne of Tarths epicness be shown for a whole 5 seconds before shes gone again\\, thiss movie was trainnwreck\\, visually it looked nice though but the story ruined it. Dear Disney please make something original AND good.","true":true}
