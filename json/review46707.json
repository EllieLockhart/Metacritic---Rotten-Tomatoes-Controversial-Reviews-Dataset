{"101487":194322,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-14","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"We all know The Force Awakens (Episode VII) is a rehash of the original (Episode IV). The best thing it has going for it is Rey\\, the first believable female Jedi to appear in the onscreen saga. So the only reason millions of fans flocked to the theater to see Episode VIII was to see Rey's story - to find out where she came from and how she received her powers. Essentially\\, J.J. Abrams pitched a softball to little Rian Johnson\\, the kid who eats paste and drools on himself\\, and somehow that kid dropped the ball. \\n\\nInstead of receiving satisfactory answers to the questions that have haunted us these past two years\\, the audience received a diaper full of poo flung at its face. More disturbing\\, critics ate it up with a poo-eating grin and said\\, \\\"Thank you\\, Disney\\, for making a strong feminist statement.\\\" And 49% of moviegoers wrote about how bold and unexpected it felt to have a diaper full of poo hurled at their faces. They denounced fans who questioned its integrity\\, asking\\, \\\"What did you expect - the same old Star Wars movie you've seen before?\\\" We can all agree on one thing - this is not the Star Wars movie we were looking for.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong\\, I appreciate The Last Jedi's originality. However\\, there exists a nearly infinite number of original plotlines not involving a diaper full of poo. Specifically\\, by \\\"poo\\\" I mean Poe\\, Poe prank calling General Huck Finn of the Costco Empire\\, Finn\\, Finn running around leaking bodily fluids around the spaceship\\, the spaceships chosen by the Costco Rebels that either used 1940's bombing technology in zero gravity or run out of fuel after one jump to hyperspace despite their enormous size relative to the smaller craft that can jump to hyperspace without a care and travel to pointless subplots such as the rescue of The Codebreaker from Rainbow Bright\\, everything to do with Rainbow Bright including the disappointment resulting from the misuse of Benicio Del Toro in a pointless role that exists only to set up another film that Disney expects us to pay to see rather than utilize him as either The Collector from the MCU and profit from a crossover or better yet have him play a more vital role in the establishment of the First Order whose origins remain unexplained and who have somehow managed to resurrect themselves in a matter of days following their defeat in the previous film\\, all of the questions from the previous film receiving a middle finger from the writer of this piece of trash who answers questions like a drunk dad trying to get his kids to go to sleep (\\\"hey dad\\, how did Rey get her powers?\\\" \\\"who cares\\, her parents were deadbeats who sold her for drinking money!\\\" \\\"hey dad\\, why did Kylo Ren destroy the Jedi Academy?\\\" \\\"because Luke Skywalker is an a-hole who walks out on his family!\\\")\\, the complete desecration of the beloved hero of the Star Wars hero Luke Skywalker by showing him not only drinking milk from the tits of a sea monster but willing to murder his nephew yet unwilling to face him as demonstrated by his massive effort exerted to create a holographic likeness of himself to pretend to face Kylo Ren across the galaxy\\, this effort resulting in Luke's unnecessary death which would have meant something if he had chosen to die fighting Kylo Ren face to face in the first place . . . basically the entire movie - you get the idea\\, right?\\n\\nDissecting this movie is exhausting\\, because it is a labyrinth of confusion. Why? Something to do with feminism and proving that anyone can be a Jedi. Accordingly\\, the film introduces a purple-haired feminist caricature\\, who we will call Admiral Gender Studies\\, to put Poe in his place. First of all\\, we have established that no one really cares about Poe. More importantly\\, the film had unique feminist icons in both Rey and Leia already\\, characters that we do care about. Rather than compose great stories about these beloved characters\\, the writer chose to drone on about some nonsense built to support his hollow agenda. I say this because his is a) a man and 2) a rich\\, white man hired by a massive multi-national corporation to create a blockbuster installment in the most profitable money-making franchise in movie history. How about making a movie about how anyone can become a screenwriter? There are hundreds of people with MFAs in screenwriting working as baristas who would give anything to have the chance to write a Star Wars script. Yet Disney gave the golden ticket to this unworthy fellow\\, this spoiled hack who can't write his way out of a paper sack\\, this fraud who has the audacity to tell kids that anyone can grow up to become a Jedi\\, standing on the shoulders of giants while he laughs all the way to the bank.\\n\\nThis film is not just a bad movie and not just an insult to millions of fans. It is an act of malice\\, much like Luke attempting to burn the Jedi scrolls. It is an affront to humanity\\, for if this is the most we can achieve with millions of dollars and the most creative minds hard at work\\, then we do not deserve to survive as a species. God might have mercy on The Phantom Menace because at least it respected the legacy\\, but The Last Jedi deserves to burn in Hell.","true":true}
