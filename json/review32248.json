Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars episode VIII The Last Jedi  is an exciting addition to the franchise that succeeds in answering many of the questions brought up in 'The Force Awakens' whilst leaving some for the final instalment of the trilogy. \\n\\nWhereas the preceding movie played it safe in the way it closely paralleled the plot of A new hope- the equivalent instalment of the preceding trilogy\\, this movie diverges from the plot of any previous movies. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi contains strong character development exceeding that of any of the previous movies\\, bringing depth\\, heart and humour to the story. Some of the plot points\\, respectfully those dealing with the antagonists\\, as well as certain developments regarding Luke Skywalker and the Jedi Order\\, are daring and serve to connect The Last Jedi to themes explored in some of the non-canon 'Old Republic' error stories.\\n\\nAll in all Star wars The Last Jedi is an impressive and entertaining movie that true Star Wars fans will appreciate.","true":true}
