Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson will go down in history for having utterly trashed Luke Skywalker who acts like a whiny brat who doesn't want to get out of bed to go to school for most of the film. Thrown in a scene of him sucking milk (or something else) out of a space cow's teat and there you have it\\, the complete flushing of a beloved character down the toilet. I now understand why Mark Hamill didn't agree with Johnson in the (lame) direction he wanted to take the iconic character. Somebody needed a payday though. Compare the Writers between The Force Awakens and this debacle and you'll quickly realize the talent was sadly missing. For Disney to so arbitrarily piss on such a legendary character is disgraceful and I'm officially done watching anymore new Star Wars movies. This film has soooooo many problems (Laura Dern looking like a Eurotrash raver\\, lame virtue-signaling political messages\\, utter disrespect for established characters in the series\\, etc.) that I could go on forever. \\nBut I'll leave by saying Goodbye Star Wars\\, you've grown unfortunately vile and soulless...and it's really heartbreaking.\\n     -T.
