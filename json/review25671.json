Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not as bad as Attack of the Clones but very close.  Disney continues to ruin characters from the original trilogy to try and build up the new cast and it doesn't work.  The casino planet scene is plain awful and the Finn and Rose storyline is a waste of time.  Too much girl power and a mediocre performance from Adam Driver.  Bottom line the new cast isn't able to carry this franchise.","true":true}
