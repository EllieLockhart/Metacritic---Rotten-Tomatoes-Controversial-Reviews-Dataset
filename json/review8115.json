Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic Film\\, the best way to sum it up is simply \\\"enjoyable\\\"\\, throughout no section of the film (save maybe one) was I bored or disatisfied with my movie ticket\\, nor did I find myself disagreeing with direction\\, acting\\, or plot.","true":true}
