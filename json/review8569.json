Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First of all\\, I created a Rotten Tomatoes  account for the sole purposes of giving a worse rating for this atrocity. If you love Star Wars for what it stands for you should not support this film. It's a total decontruction of the mythos\\, philosophy and physics of the universe previously establisd. I think fans that did not like this film should petition  Lucasfilm for a refund. Star wars fans need to rebel and take it back from this Empire that is Disney\/Lucas film by supporting nothing they do in the future of Star Wars.","true":true}
