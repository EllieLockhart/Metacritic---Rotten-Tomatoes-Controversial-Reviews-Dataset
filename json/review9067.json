Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Full of flaws. Subversions for the sake of subversion without having any meaning behind them. About 30min of the story could be cut without affecting the story. Throws away everything that was built up in Force awakens. The main character\\, Rey\\, is bland. If blowing 5 planets does not wake republic from slumber\\, I don't know what does. How can first order reign supreme by destroying 5 planets and by losing their big gun; isn't the galaxy supposed to contain more planets as shown in prequels. This movie is a hot mess and potentially might have killed the franchise.","true":true}
