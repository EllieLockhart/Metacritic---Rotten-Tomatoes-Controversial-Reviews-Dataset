Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Somewhere in here there's a good film trying to get out. Unfortunately it's bogged down with misplaced sub plots\\, terribly timed and inappropriate jokes\\, false peaks and completely mis-writing classic characters (why Lukes emotional back story was given the same screen time as a floppy eared race horse I'll never know) .\\n\\nSaying that\\, the new characters were interesting\\, if it had been written better Lukes arc would have been great and it did go somewhere new with the story.","true":true}
