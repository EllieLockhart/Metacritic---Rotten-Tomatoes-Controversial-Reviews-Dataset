Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Still a fun movie\\, but not nearly as epic as VII. Ren\u2019s powers are inconsistent with VII. He can throw people around with the force but then struggles with those 3 red guys for 15 minutes. The story should have been more about Ray\u2019s training with the force. I wanted to see a Yoda\/Skywalker relationship between Skywalker\/Ray. ","true":true}
