Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A disappointing tryst into poor storytelling\\, with better advertisements than the actual thing. \\nTip:\\nIf you liked the Force Awakens: You wont like The Last Jedi\\nIf you liked Rogue One: You wont like The Last Jedi.\\nIf you like cohesive storytelling\\, and basic logic: You won't like The Last Jedi.\\nIf you want to take a break from your anxieties\\, to watch a feel good movie by Disney\\, which is sure to at the very least be minutely entertaining; You won't like the Last Jedi\\nJust go watch Thor Ragnarok\\, at least it is funny.\\n*However\\,\\nIf you want an in depth understanding on the Social Dynamics\\, feelings\\, life cycle\\, breeding habits\\, habitat\\, sleeping habits among other informations\\, on the fictional\\, wide eyed\\, \\\"Porg\\\"\\, then by all means\\, Disregard the above ramblings\\, and enjoy the film","true":true}
