Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One lightsaber fight and then Luke wasn't even really there in the final scene. More kicking ass and more action was needed on the grouns\\, besides space battles. The fight with the speeders on Crait was soo underwhelming! Coule have gone longee on that scene! (The space battles were good though). Every scene with Kylo Ren and Rey was great in my opinion. Was hoping for a quick kiss between them! ;)","true":true}
