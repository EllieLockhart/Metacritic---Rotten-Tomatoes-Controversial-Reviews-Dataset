Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great Star Wars movie. Lots of twists and things I didn't see coming.  Only thing it needed was a Snoke backstory.   We were on the edge of our seats for most of the movie.\\nThen I watched it a second and third time\\,  hard to get thru it. Several things bugged me so bad it kind a ruined the movie for me.","true":true}
