Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great on execution with a poor story.  The lack of imagination of the screenplay is staggering.  The only continuation with the Force Awakens are the characters and even for Rey\\, Kylo\\, Finn and Poe\\nthey are all way under develop.  We learn basically nothing new. Instead new thin characters are presented who brings virtually nothing to the story. It's as if the only mandate Rian Johnson had in mind was to try to surprise the audience at all cost even if the story\\, the characters and the continuation for the rest of the trilogy suffers for it.  With all the talents and resources at Lucasfilm this is really one disappointing Star Wars movie to say the least.  And all my thoughts goes for you Mark Hamill.  You were great once again playing Luke Skywalker. I'm so sad as a fan to finally see you back as Luke only to be butchered by a writer\/director with a total lack of vision. And they give this guy an entire new trilogy !  Star Wars is a wonderful universe\\, is it this hard to make a good movie with a good story ?","true":true}
