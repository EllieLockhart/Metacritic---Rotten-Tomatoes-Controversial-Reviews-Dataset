Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Okay\\, for those of you that grew up\\, like I\\, a SW nut..think this through. I see the low ratings fan rating and it\u2019s disappointing. Manly because your anger and frustration is pointed at the wrong place. We all wanted the continuing story of Luke\\, Leia and Han and never got it. Lucas sat on for 16 years and the best out CREATOR could give us was Jar Jar Binks and a horrible Anakin Skywalker storyline?!? Then I remembered the Ewoks\\, friggin awful. Lucas ran out of ideas for the magnificent universe he creates. I think Disney is doing its best to carry forth a story it\u2019s creator cares little for. In short\\, this is a solid movie in the Star Wars universe...hands down. ","true":true}
