Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It\u2019s just plain bad. I hope for a reboot to this drivel. It has a few moments but the overall theme is just nonsense. It does have good parts with respect to action sequences. ","true":true}
