Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointed in Star Wars: The Last Jedi. After all the effort to \\\"find Luke Skywalker\\\" in Force Awakens his role is this galactic conflict is complete \\\"meh\\\".  We also find out that he almost murdered someone. When did Luke go nuts? This movie will probably disappoint anyone who loved the Luke of their childhood. Mark Hamill has not stopped complaining about this script and he's right. They really kinda ruin Luke. The rest of the movie is just ok. Not much is accomplished. It is a lot of filler splattered around upsetting revelations about a beloved character.","true":true}
