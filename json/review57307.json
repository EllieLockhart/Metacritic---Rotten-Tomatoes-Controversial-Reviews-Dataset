Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is decent by his own\\, but is completely incoherent and ridicule when you consider it happens just after The Force Awakens and the other Star Wars. \\n\\nThe more you ask legitimate questions\\, the worst it gets. the hell are Y wings instead of these shitty bombers? If Luke exiled himself because he wanted to die\\, why did it left a map behind him? Rey is able to take down the personal gards of a sith lord because she practiced against a rock? She's able to lift a ton of bolders because she was told once by Luke to breathe and reach out?  Where is the military of an entire galactic republic? Why the first order has so much ressources? Did Fin and Rose accomplished anything except directly cause the death of a large majority of the forces of the resistance? If Kylo is an conflicted between light and dark\\, is there any real bad guy since Snoke is dead? Why did Rian took out the scene where Luke cry for Han\\, but kept the green milk scene? Do you know there's only a couple of days between the moment she's a worthless slave on Jakku and the moment she saves what's left of the resistance? Etc. Etc. Etc.\\n\\nRian ruined his movie and the one of JJ Abrams\\, because he destroyed anything new and interesting that JJ brought. Every mystery box ruined by simple and ridicule answers or no answers. Cool and new elements were ignored. Rey never truely failed yet\\, she didn't progress\\, we don't know why she's so invested in the fight\\, who she is or why the hell she is so god damn strong. Plus\\, we still only have a small group of rebels... sorry... resistants against an empire\\, there's nothing new. Luke was ruined and had a shitty death (we could have a true epic fight\\, but we got a dance... yhea...) \\n\\nPlus\\, the movie has inherent defaults\\, like it's shitty humor.\\n\\nI hated it and the more I think or watch it\\, the worst it gets. But I'd like to say that the people who personally attacked the actors or the staff that worked on the film just because ot was bad are the worst kind of person.","true":true}
