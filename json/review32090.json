Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers: The biggest problem with this movie is that the characters achieve almost nothing. Finn's mission is not only a fail\\, but it results in the resistance escape plan being exposed and causes more problems. Luke teaches Rey nothing and she learns nothing in her time there. If the characters would have done nothing (aside from Rey going to meet Kylo) then everything would have been fine for the resistance. \\n\\nLike Poe at the start of the film\\, it feels like we're being tooled with when we are teased with the identity of Rey's parents\\, then learn that her parents are nobodies. The film also sets Snoke up to be a powerful villain but he is easily defeated\\, causing all the build up and mystery around him to be negated. While there are fun moments\\, overall\\, the mystery that J.J. Abrams created is treated with ambivalence and ultimately results in nothing. \\n\\nAlso\\, not a fan of super Leia. \\n#LeiaPoppins","true":true}
