Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Gravity in space\\nNo vacuum in space\\nLuke basically isn't in the movie\\nRose returning to base but still able to be faster then Finn\\nCanto Bight looks like italy instead of a star wars planet\\nRey doesn't need any training and is stronger then Luke and Anakin\\nSnokes tongue\\nNo lightsaber battle\\n1 small resistence ship beats an entire first order fleet but loses of a tie fighter\\nNot even 1 cool scene in the whole entire 2 and a half hour long movie\\nI think the next star wars movie should be a reboot of episode 8\\nwith an alternate title like this one never happened\\nBut I still don't hate it\\, but i am 100% disappointed in Rian","true":true}
