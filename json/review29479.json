Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson has successfully changed the landscape of Star Wars forever.  While that may be great for some including critics it's very bad for others.  Star Wars is a franchise that is built on the backs of it's fans most of whom have followed the franchise for 40 years.  These same fans have introduced this franchise to their children also.  \\n\\nKylo REn pretty much sums up what Rian Johnson has done when he makes the statement \\\"Kill the past\\\"  You can make good Star Wars movies without destroying what people already know and love.  \\n\\nI wont even get into the fact that Rey is a Mary Sue.  THat Leia is superman.  Or any of the SJW stuff that was throughout this film.  Fact still remains that the movie is making a killing   This movie has made a billion dollars on the backs of the people that this movie slaps in the face.\\n\\nif i had three hands I would give it three thumbs down but I only have two so two thumbs down\\n\\nThis is not the star wars you grew up on   its more Hunger games meets Battlestar Galactica","true":true}
