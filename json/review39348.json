Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is better than The Rise of Skywalker despite its own major flaws. The main issues are the weird comedy\\, the disregard for the characters (in particular Luke) and Star Wars lore (e.g. the Holdo Maneuver)\\, and the pointless side quest with Finn and Rose that contains some preachy animal cruelty content. However\\, at least this film wasn't a clone of one of the original films so it has that going for it but it was still somewhat painful to watch.","true":true}
