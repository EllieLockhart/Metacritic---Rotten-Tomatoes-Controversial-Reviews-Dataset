Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to love this movie\\, but... well the movie fell short on the attention to good story telling. It had a confusing plot\\, the only thing that was consistent with episode 7 was the characters\\, the jokes funny they were\\, Star Wars they were not. The story felt slow\\, then rushed then what the hell. The silent scene\\, well congrats you just made another movie. I've seen many movies with silence when loud stuff is supposed to happen. You can't even say this movie was good\\, it felt like a drawn out tv show rather than a movie that they spent millions on.it Felt like a zombie show that had no zombies.","true":true}
