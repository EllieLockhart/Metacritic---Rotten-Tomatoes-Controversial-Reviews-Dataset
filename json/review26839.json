Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of my favorites. I think it is okay to dislike this movie\\, but for the audience to rate it worse than the phantom menace is ridiculous. I personally liked the twists and Mark Hamill had an amazing performance. Rey and Kylo had an amazing connection throughout the film. people need to stop getting on the where did snoke come from train. We didn't know anything about the Emperor until the prequels and no one had a problem with him. Don't listen to anyone else\\, use your own judgement.","true":true}
