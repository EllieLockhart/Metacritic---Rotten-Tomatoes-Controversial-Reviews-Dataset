Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a true fan of Star Wars and loved the movie from the action\\, to the true return of Luke Skywalker\\, to so much more. That's where I see the critics are in the right for this one as opposed to those unfairly giving it a half to one to even two stars. It wasn't perfect\\, pretty much no movie is\\, but there is no way one can be a true fan and give it a half of a star. I even liked the Porgs because they were a humor device which worked and were done well...because these are still  movies that children as well as adults are meant to enjoy to those detractors out there. Plus\\, they didn't save the Rebellion...I'm looking at you Ewoks. lol  I have to be honest though\\, I was a bit confused when I first left the theater for a couple of things in particular especially Snoke's death and two a lesser degree Rey's parents\\, but once I thought about it more...it is much more of a misdirection (which is pretty cool) than it is an unsatisfying answer to a mystery which I doubt very very much is the case. The clues are all there that it is truly a misdirection especially when I went to it a second time. I think too many people were looking at this to follow the same pattern as Empire Strikes Back with the big mystery reveals in that one which now save them for episode 9 which will truly make the TLJ even greater once episode 9 hits and ties everything together nicely. There is the off chance I could be wrong\\, but I doubt I am.  One final thought\\, one just needs to look at the box office totals to truly see the negative reviews are in the minority here.","true":true}
