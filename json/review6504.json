Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dissapointed I am. We all agree that disney f***** it up! Many loved classic characters didnt get the respect they deserve. The lack of answers and when we got some answers they where so bad. Snoke wtf!?! What was the f**** point of this character. Lol theres so many bad things about this film BUT a few good ones to. The directing was good and as a movie outside of the Star wars universe it would be great but this one BAD Star wars movie. Flashback to episode I and II.","true":true}
