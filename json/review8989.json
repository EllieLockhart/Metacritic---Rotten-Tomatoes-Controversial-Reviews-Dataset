Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From what I gather regarding the negative reactions are people either A) had their own \\\"head canon\\\" and expectations of what this movie was going to be and are bitter that character A didn't do XYZ or B) they misunderstood and missed the theme of the movie entirely.  \\n\\nThe more time has passed since I saw it\\, the more I have enjoyed it. Can't wait to see it again.","true":true}
