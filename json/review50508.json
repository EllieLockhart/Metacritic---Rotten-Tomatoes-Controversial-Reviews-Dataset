Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"1. Justice for Luke\\n2. Leia is apparently a Mary Poppins Space Witch\\n3. Lame humor \\n5. The plot focuses too much on scenery and creatures and too many characters are introduced. It's hard to follow and nothing ties in properly.\\n6. What is the point of Snoke?\\n7. Way too much political correctness. Love\\, not war XOXO BS.\\n\\nI got an account on Rotten Tomatoes just to write a bad review. I didn't particularly like TFA either\\, but at least it read like a Star Wars movie. The Last Jedi is just Disney fodder and meant to cater to a younger crowd. People may say the Star Wars fans are jaded and whiny\\, but the Star Wars movies have been a disappointment since the prequels (minus Rogue One).","true":true}
