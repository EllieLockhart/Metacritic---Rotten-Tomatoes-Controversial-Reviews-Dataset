Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a very devoted StarWars fan\\, and this movie had more plot holes than Jedi killed due to order 66! here are a few...\\n1. Who the frick is Snoke?\\n          - He appeared out of knowhere commands the universe and then just gets killed......?\\n2. why didn't they kamikaze the dreadnought right off the bat instead of sacrificing so many bombers. \\n     - also the design of those bombers is stupid\\, its almost like they were designed to be blown up before they reached their target. (which they did not reach except for a very unrealistically lucky one)\\n3. THAT WAS NOT LUKE SKYWALKER!!!!! THAT WAS SOME DARKSIDE TRICK THAT JUST BROUGHT HOPE OUT OF THE WORLD INSTEAD OF TRIDE TO SPREAD HOPE!!!! LIKE WHAT.?.?.?.?.?\\n4. ALL OF THE ABOVE AND LIKE 9000 MORE!!!\\n\\ni am sorry George Lucas and i am sorry to the galaxy.\\n                                                         MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU!\\n","true":true}
