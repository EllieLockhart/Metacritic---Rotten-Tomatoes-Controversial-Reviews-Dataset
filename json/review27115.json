Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the worst films I have ever seen (and I've seen some terrible movies in my time). 1 dimensional characters that are inconsistent and ridiculous; plot holes; boring slow motion chase scenes that last the whole movie\\, 30 minute pointless scene in the middle of the movie; no link to the previous movies; no direction for the subsequent movies; flat jokes that are completely out of character; stiff direction with failed attempts to subvert expectations that become boringly predictable after the first few minutes of the movie.....","true":true}
