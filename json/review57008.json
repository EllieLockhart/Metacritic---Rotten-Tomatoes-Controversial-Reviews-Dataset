Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Things I liked about this movie:\\n1.  The music\\n2.  The fight scene in Snoke's chambers\\n\\nThings I hated in this movie:\\n1. Flying Leia\\n2.  Corny humor\\n3. Luke attempting to kill his nephew in his sleep\\n4. The whole Canto Bight scene\\n5.  The leftist propaganda throughout the movie\\n6.  The new girl character with Fin in Canto Bight - she is boring\\n7.  Luke milking an elephant\/walrus\\n8.  Snoke's lame death\\n9. The explanation of who Rey's parents were\\n10. Luke's demise\\n11.  Luke tossing his lightsaber over his shoulder\\n12. New girl crashing her speeder into Fin's to prevent his sacrifice\\n13. New girl's incredibly cheesey line about saving what we love\\n14. Not enough BB8\\, C3P0 or R2D2\\n15. Running out of gas...really?\\n16.  Who was Snoke?\\n17.  Why didn't purple-haired lady tell Poe the plan?\\n18. Prank call\/your mama \\\"joke\\\"\\n19 Rey has no training and yet she uses the force like a jedi master\\n20. Kylo Ren's shirtless scene\\n21. Not enough Chewbacca\\n22.  Obvious attempt at a diverse cast jsut for the sake of a diverse cast\\n\\nThose are the things that came off the top of my head.  I could go on but that's enough.  It pains me to say this\\, but that was the worst movie I've seen in a long time.  Disney\\, I would like a refund.","true":true}
