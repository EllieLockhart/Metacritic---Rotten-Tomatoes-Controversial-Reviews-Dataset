Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Honestly\\, i was the biggest fan of the last of us series. When waiting 7 Years for this game I was highly disappointed with what I received. The game was absolutely beautiful\\, Scenes and graphic were on point and we got to play as Ellie so I thought. This game could of been so much better\\, Storyline was very badly executed. I remember in the teaser trailer of TLOU2 we saw Ellie and Joel in the overgrown town and myself I was very excited thinking it would be a switch from TLOU1 and we play as Ellie with Joel besides us. Naughty dog milked us into thinking Joel would be with us in the story but into the game they killed him off. I was highly displeased with the trailers as they were just for revenue and sales for this game + the Leaks and all the controversy with this game really let it down.\r\r2. Abby\\, Like seriously how many people has Joel killed and you don't see some buff women seeking revenge 2 hours in TLOU2. They dedicated too much time for her in this game as she really did not need to be played by the consumers of this game. It would have been better if we had known she was seeking revenge but no game time should of been put into her. The big issue with this game is they were trying to keep up with modern society and the LGBTQ movement. Though I don't have an issue with Ellie and her Sexuality it was a big let down knowing they had 7 years and the s*x scenes were just horrible and uncalled for + with the whole Abby S*x scene it was the worst thing I've ever seen\\, Far cry had better scenes. The killing of Joel by Abby could of been a very good Plot for the game. It would give Ellie an excuse to seek revenge for everyone that \\\"wronged her\\\" yeah well the Main person that \\\"wronged you\\\" got a jail free card at the end because you felt bad that Joel would not want you to do this but you have killed 200+ people to get where you are.\r\rAt the end of the day\\, the game was somewhat enjoyable the Ai were super realistic and communicative which I enjoyed + the WLF faction and the Seraphites where something I enjoyed being added. But I think there was more fighting in the factions more than Ellie seeking revenge for Abby killing Joel\\, therefore\\, me rating it 2\/10 from someone that has played the game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
