No\\, but it\u2019s the closest the gaming industry has come in my opinion. Graphics\\, smoothness\\, sound oh the sound\\, gets me like only a nostalgic runescape Esque sound could!

I do not know what the developers had to do crunch wise to get this game working so perfectly...After any deaths\\, the loading screen is virtually instant to load back in (2 seconds max)... the colour pallet\\, the scenery\\, THE OCEAN WAVES\\, best water animation I have seen! Now\\, why isn\u2019t it perfect? In my opinion this would have been an absolute perfect 3rd rendition of the series\\, the reason I saw this is because I so desperately wanted more of the 1st game again. And this is just such a flip\\, story wise. Takes away a lot of what people loved in the first\\, so I can see where people\u2019s criticisms come from. However\\, for me the story is so bold\\, risky and so ever present of real life\\, it just hits my emotions so hard\\, and I couldn\u2019t love that feeling more (as sad as a lot of it is)The sun rays And location displayed in the first chapter\\, is something I wish I could have played for longer! Imagine this as an open world\\, playing so smoothly! Other devs take a note\\,\\,\\, I\u2019ll be expecting this quality in ps5 to rate another game as 10! Even the gameplay super fun\\, moments that scared me\\, moments that made me feel as if I just just just survived with no ammo\\, or gear left.Ohhhh I wish for some DLC or a 3rd game soon... don\u2019t make it another 7 years please! But if it is 7 years away\\, wow it will be worth the wait!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
