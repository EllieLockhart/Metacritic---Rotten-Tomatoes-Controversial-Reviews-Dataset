Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was embarrassingly bad. The writing and storylines make the prequels look impressive. The slaughtering of every interesting plot line in this new generation was unforgivable\\, and the presentation of the known characters was disgraceful. New characters were introduced\\, never expanded upon\\, and then presented as heroes. Ridiculous ","true":true}
