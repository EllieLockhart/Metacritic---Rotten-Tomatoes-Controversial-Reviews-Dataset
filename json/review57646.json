Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To quote Han...that's not how the force works.  People liking the movie for it \\\"reinventing\\\" the force obviously don't care about it.  Anyone saying the movie was well made didn't spend even 5 seconds thinking about it.  None of the movie is necessary\\, and it's painfully obvious.  The movie is full of terrible choices\\, weak plots and gaping holes.  Whether a person likes TFA or not\\, it was entertaining and felt like Star Wars.  This movie was neither.  It was unnecessarily long and boring and what humor there was\\, was seriously out of place.  He completely ignored so many parts of TFA.  He answered who Rey's parents are in a very ridiculous manner.  Gave it no weight or purpose\\, and they way he did it is genuinely unbelievable (as in\\, why should anyone\\, including Rey believe the answer considering who gives the answer\\, how they give it\\, and why).  If you see the movie (which you shouldn't)\\, seriously ask why you should believe it.  \\n\\nThen there is how all of the characters are treated.  Some of the previous characters are made unlikable for no reason\\, some of the new characters served no real purpose. The OT characters\\, he destroyed.  I keep asking myself why he hates Luke so much to do him so wrong.  Mark was right to complain and I can't help but completely agree with everything Mark says Luke is versus what Rian made him.  None of what was done with Luke made a lick of sense and was offensive to Star Wars and Luke.  \\n\\nThe flight of Leia was painful to watch because it was so tacky\\n\\nSo many of the camera shots were out of place.  Either the matrix like saber swing over a bent back character\\, or all of the \\\"linked\\\" scenes which were shot so poorly that they felt awkward and clunky\\n\\nThere were a handful of moving moments\\, but the movie lacked the two things vital to a Star Wars film\\, it had no hope and no heart.","true":true}
