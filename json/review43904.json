Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Though not all of its sequences are a triumph\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a welcome installment to the 40 year old franchise. Written and directed by Rian Johnson\\, the 44 year old auteur was tasked with a monumental job - devise an epic space fantasy that both honors the past yet takes the series in a new direction. Johnson has struck that balance\\, but has not avoided his fair share of detractors in the process. Its a shame too\\, as Johnson has managed to explore the characters both old and new\\, at a depth and complexity that hasn't been matched since The Empire Strikes back. Photographed by longtime Johnson pal Steve Yedlin\\, the striking visual nods to Kurosawa\\, as well as the stunning landscape shots of Ireland's Skellig Michael are a joy to soak in. Although the film's subplot involving \\\"Canto Bight\\,\\\" a Monaco inspired casino setting\\, echoes the prequels in an unwelcome way\\, The Last Jedi is a welcome change of pace\\, and will hopefully mark a new path forward for Star Wars.","true":true}
