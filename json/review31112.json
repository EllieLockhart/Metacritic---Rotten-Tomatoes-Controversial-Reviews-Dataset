Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Solidly entertaining\\, even for a die-hard fan. There are things which don't make sense\\, and a few of these are even significant\\, but these enigmatic hiccups do not derail the value of the film overall. I will be seeing it a second time. You will want to run to the interwebs to discuss this film with fellow fans. Many new questions are raised\\, along with new possibilities. The future for Star Wars...is full of *hope*.
