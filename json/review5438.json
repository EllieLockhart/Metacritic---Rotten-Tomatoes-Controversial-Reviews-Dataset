Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite some pacing issues\\, the Last Jedi is one of the best Star Wars in regards to cinematography\\, editing\\, sound mixing and visual effects. It also has\\, hands down\\, the best fight scene in a Star Wars movie to date. Excellent performances from Mark Hamill\\, Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver make the movie that much better. I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who loves Star Wars. ","true":true}
