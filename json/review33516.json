Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible. Disney laughs in the face of the lore that has been built up over decades of Star Wars. The plot is paper thin\\, there's swearing\\, humour and jokes that shout Marvel and Dinsey\\, NOT Star Wars. It also features the most ridiculous Mary Poppins-esque scene ever to be included in the Star Wars universe. Sad times :(","true":true}
