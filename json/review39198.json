Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film breaks my heart. Complete garbage. Only people of very low intelligence will enjoy it. What a wasted opportunity to create something that would bring joy. Instead it brings division and anger. Disney have failed epically. The franchise is now scarred permanently.","true":true}
