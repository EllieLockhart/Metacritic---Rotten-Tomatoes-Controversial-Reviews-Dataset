Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Did have some issues with pacing and structure as well as pointless subplots and inappropriate comedy\\, but my goodness Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley were awesome. Will re-watch just for their scenes!","true":true}
