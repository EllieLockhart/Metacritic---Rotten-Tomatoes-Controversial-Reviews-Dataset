Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Too many plot holes and plot armor and really lacking in depth. Why didn't Abby just kill Ellie and Tommy the first time? Why didn't Abby kill Ellie and Tommy the second time?! Why didn't Ellie just kill her at the end\\, she has so many less significant people for less including dogs?! I don't buy the idea that Ellie would set out on a revenge mission in the first place or that she would have been allowed to go. I don't buy that Tommy would have set out on his own and I don't buy that he didn't die when he tried. I also don't buy that they managed to kill EVERYONE except Abby?!\r\rWhy would Ellie not want to turn back if Dina is pregnant? Why would Dina not turn back on her own if she was pregnant? Why would Abby torture Joel if she's portrayed as such a \\\"likeable\\\" person in the game? Why would Tommy make Ellie feel guilty about not going after Abby? That seems way out of character to me.\r\rOn top of all the above\\, at least half of the game play is Abby and I just couldn't empathize with her at all. I hated her and I hated playing as her. Also\\, the last part of the game where you play as Ellie is by far the weakest part of the game\\, I didn't buy into the story or the setting. It felt very cliche and quite frankly boring. I felt irritated\\, frustrated and disappointed with this game. Please don't but this game\\, if we support them then this kind of substandard nonsense will continue.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
