Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not on the top of my Star Wars list. I've loved Star Wars since I was a child\\, and this made my dreams come crashing down\\, even more so than the phantom menace. Disney has taken something great\\, and added some good elements\\, but has overall done more damage than good. \\nFirstly\\, the satirical elements that Disney tried to throw into the film where badly executed and just pointless.\\nSecondly\\, the story had no real point and could have been avoided all together. Overall the film was as disappointing as John Boyega's performance\\, which was disappointing at best.","true":true}
