Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Go watch this movie for yourself. If you understand what Star Wars is really about then you\u2019ll like it. If you think that Star Wars is \u201cyours\u201d and that it should go the way \u201cyou\u201d want it to\\, you may not like it. It is refreshing\\, full of hope and surprises. Oh and if you say you are a die hard Star Wars fan and you even like the prequels then you are only kidding yourself. ","true":true}
