Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie suffers greatly on Rey have zero to no character development\\, mixed together with a plot that trips on itself. The movie had chances to make interesting and changing motifs but decides to go the safest route failing to establish itself or giving it a identity to separate itself. The end of the movie answers several questions but builds nothing on the Star Wars Universe.\\n\\nIt feels like a safe\\, soulless\\, unimaginative cash grab. I feel really disappointed in the turn the movie took.","true":true}
