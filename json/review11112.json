Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"hile visually appealing\\, this new take on Star Wars was far-fetched from the galactic tales many have grown accustomed to. Witty humor\\, breathtaking cinematography and somewhat unexpected (and divisive) plot twists undoubtedly made the film confusing and controversial between die-hard fans and weekend moviegoers. Bold choices were matched with mediocre ones\\, and whether or not the movie was enjoyable vastly differs from head to head. Ultimately\\, The Last Jedi was a fun viewing and yet another addition to the quickly-growing Star Wars franchise. Expect many more twists and turns as Disney veers future Star Wars films from the original trilogy and establishes new galactic adventures for a younger generation.","true":true}
