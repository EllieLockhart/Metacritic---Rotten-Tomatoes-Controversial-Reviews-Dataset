Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a huge Star Wars fan I left the theater feeling incredibly disappointed. The whole movie was pointless. The story hinges on a pointless and nonsensical slow chase\\, the b-plots were pointless and amounted to nothing\\, there was no character progression whatsoever\\, and the director seemed to intentionally want to disappoint the audience for no reason other than to subvert expectations (not the point of a Star Wars movie). \\n\\nThe studio needs to desperately fire Rian Johnson\\, not give him control of a whole new trilogy. I refuse to watch another SW film with his name anywhere attached to it.","true":true}
