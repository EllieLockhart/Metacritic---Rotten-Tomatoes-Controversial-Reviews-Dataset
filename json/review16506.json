Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I must say I don't know star wars anymore. I was introduced to it by the prequels and have never gotten the chance to view the original trilogy. I have to say this story left me feeling more depressed than when I entered\\, it doesn't help I felt horrible coming into the theater due to personal issues. The film doesn't treat any of it's side characters with care\\, It has holes in its conflicts\\, raises even more into the films before it. The diverse cast & the aliens are given poorly constructed plot-wheels to turn. Outside of 3 characters I'd say that the filming even portrays a level of pure incompetence onto them\\, most who happen to be the diverse cast. As if casting a condescending light They even make the same mistakes as the prequels\\, and manage to bring the whole of jar jar binks into one movie through one of the diverse cast. And my greatest passion of star wars fighters battles is now questioned at every turn with why isn't anyone pulling a a specific maneuver that a specific character does even though that character created the pickle jar indirectly they were stuck in. \\nI feel like I'm losing a good friend who's been there for me due to disease. The cinematography holds up\\, the music fits well\\, the visual effects are great\\, but all of that is wasted on a story twisted and jagged on par with Michael Bay & M.night Shamalan quality.","true":true}
