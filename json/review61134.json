The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"There's no denying that this game deserves all the plaudits it can get from a technical perspective.  Sound design\\, graphics\\, animation and the combat is exceptional.  For that\\, the team deserve to be congratulated.\r\rHowever\\, the story is another matter.  It's clear that it must have suffered at the hands of the politics at play here.  Originally\\, when others were slamming the gay\\, female-led story before it had even come out (!)\\, I was up there defending it - stating it didn't matter - that the story is what matters and if the story is good\\, who cares what a characters persuasion is.\r\rBut that's the problem - it's NOT a good story.  It's just - dull.  Ellie has turned into a lean\\, mean killing machine.  There's a body count here higher than Hot Shots Part Deux.  There's little\\, other than the killing of Joel\\, to support just how angry she's become.  There's also little choice - particularly in areas where choice should matter.  For example\\, in one of the final confrontations - I didn't WANT to attack Abby.  I wanted to let her off - like she did Ellie.  However I wasn't allowed to make that choice.\r\rThe writing is also lazy.  So much so\\, they squeezed in as much of the current zeitgeist as they could muster.  Again\\, if it was relevant to the story then sure - go ahead.  But it's clear that it's been injected into it to make it relevant.\r\rIt's also way too long.  It took me 30 hours to complete it.  I was done with it by 16.  It's repetitive\\, way too much in the way of boring cutscenes (the farmhouse family skit towards the end was just too much)\\, and when Ellie sets off again I actually got annoyed.\r\rI'd actually completed the first part just before the 2nd came out (never had enough time)\\, so for me the first was very\\, very fresh.  The only part of the 2nd game I actually enjoyed the story was Abby's - seeing if from her perspective\\, how the couples' rampage across the US affected her.  That's about it though.\r\rI'd say borrow it from a friend.  Experience it\\, but don't be surprised if you give up at the 14-16 hour mark.  You're in it for the long haul\\, but sadly those extra hours won't make a damn bit of difference to the story.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
