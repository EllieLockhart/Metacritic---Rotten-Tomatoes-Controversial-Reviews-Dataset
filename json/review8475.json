Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Finally got to see The Last Jedi with my family.  We really enjoyed it.  It was very different from other Star Wars movies\\, but to me that was it's greatest strength.  Some really strong performances in this one\\, especially by Mark Hamill and Adam Driver.  Definitely not the movie I was expecting\\, but I was very happy by the one we got here.","true":true}
