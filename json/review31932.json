{"101487":169323,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoiler Free Review: \\nThe backlash around this movie seems to boil down to a few main things\\, misplaced humor\\, treating the old characters unjustly\\, a lack of pay off for questions set up in Episode VII\\, and a side arc on one of the worlds introduced in the story. While fans and critics can argue back and fourth on these till everyone is blue in the face\\, I want to explain why this film is amazing without touching these points that have already been talked to death about. \\n\\n1) Themes\\, the Last Jedi offers more in the way of story themes then any of the Star Wars movies since the Original Trilogy and even more then the Return of the Jedi. Every single character arc\/story ( so for non spoiler reasons will call them Rey\\, Poe\\, and Finn arcs) have both their own unique themes for their corresponding character\\, but all three arcs come back to the main theme of the Last Jedi. Rian expertly lets all three of these characters\/arcs face this one theme in a unique way\\, while still all coming to the same conclusion. The movie does beat the audience over the head with this theme\\, but does it with one of the best fan service surprises possible\\, so everyone whose seen the movie should know what I'm referencing. The fact the Last Jedi has an actual message and lesson for it's characters to learn is beyond most Star Wars movies.  I mean ask yourself what was the lesson in the Force Awakens or any other starwars film? Then compare your answers to the Last Jedi\\, and see how much deeper meaning this film has to offer.  \\n\\n2) It's not a repeat of Episode V. The main criticism that the Force Awakens received was how many of it's beats were from a New Hope ( Which I personally do think was the smart approach for starting a new trilogy\\, but only for starting). So while there are some similarities with Empire Strikes Back for sure\\, Last Jedi does enough of it's own stuff that makes it all work.  The Last Jedi\\, for good or bad\\,  is it's own thing in the star wars universe. If Force Awakens was proving the new owners knew what Star Wars was\\, then the Last Jedi is proving what star wars can be. \\n\\n3) Twists\\, and man is there a ton of them. I can't go into to much detail without spoiler territory\\, but man is the Last Jedi a roller coaster with your expectations. Honestly it's not surprising some fans have a metaphorical whiplash after watching it.  These twists though is the greatest similarity it has to Empire Strikes Back\\, since that Original Star Wars film had the grand daddy of all twists.  Rian Johnson forced you to rethink everything and in a series that now has 9 main movie titles belonging to it\\, this has to be done or Star Wars will go stagnant. \\n\\nChange isn't the easiest thing to accept\\, but in the case of the Last Jedi\\, I think it will be for the best!","true":true}
