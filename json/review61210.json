Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I dont know how but this game is even worst than the original\\, but my brother bought it and i feel so disgusted by this game. The gameplay is exactly the same than the OG\\, nothing new\\, really boring and not fun. The graphics are awesome\\, for me the only good thing in the game. I won't say the soundtrack is bad but it feels like doesn't fit for me\\, is just like we know the story is dramaticI dont know how but this game is even worst than the original\\, but my brother bought it and i feel so disgusted by this game.

I won't say the soundtrack is bad but it feels like doesn't fit for me\\, is just like we know the story is dramatic and all that sh*t but why they want to prove it so much. At the end the first game was only \\\"good\\\" for the story but this one is so bad. Maybe it was the decision they took\\, i can care less about the inclusion it's just that they try to be realistic with a story so unrealistic. The main character of the last game is killed in a gruesome way\\, just like any other character in this freaking game\\, really unnecessary every character was killed even if they appeared 10 minutes ago with Abby just forgeting them 5 seconds later\\, except the one she was in love obviously. Then they told us that we wouldn't have to kill any animal but you are forced to kill a lot of dogs and one character just unnecessarily kill a horse in front of the player. A 5 months pregnant women just running around shouting guys\\, a girl lifting a really big ladder from the beginning of it\\, are some of many things in this game than make 0 sense. Ellie;s character lose so much in this game\\,specially at the end\\, Abby is the best one in my opinion. I never liked Joel in the first one but in this game get so much sh*t. I think people are criticizing this game for the wrong thing\\, this one is just trash\u2026 Expand","true":true}
