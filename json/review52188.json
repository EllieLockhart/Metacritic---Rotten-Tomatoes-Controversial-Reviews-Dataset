Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After watching Episode I the first time\\, I thought it would get better if I watched it again. It never did. Each viewing uncovered new pieces of the train wreck. With The Last Jedi\\, it was apparent off the bat that it was bad. This film ranks with the prequels. Outside of bad writing\/storytelling\/plotting\/dialogue\\, it looks low budget\\, actors look out of shape\\, and worst of all it touches on core Star Wars lore with its brush of mediocrity.","true":true}
