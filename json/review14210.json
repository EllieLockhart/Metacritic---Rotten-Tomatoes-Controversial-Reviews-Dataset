Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I get the director's desire to try to go with an \\\"out with the old\\, and in with the new\\\" message\\, but he didn't have to do it in the worst way possible. Mark Hamill deserves better. In fact\\, all of the actors and actresses in the film deserved better. This movie had so much potential built up from the previous\\, and they took the laziest route in order to try to further interest. Poor tone\\, several continuity\\, and it's one thing to ignore fans in order to do what you think is best\\, and it's another different thing when you disregard any sort of feeling fans would hold.","true":true}
