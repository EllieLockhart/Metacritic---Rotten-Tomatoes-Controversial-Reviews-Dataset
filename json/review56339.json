Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Taking the mantle as the worst Star Wars film in the saga this is a disappointing\\, frustrating and ultimately pointless addition. The paper thin plot and boring writing make for a hard to watch movie. The movie is full of social-justice millennial messages and has no worries destroying interesting characters\/lore (see ackbar\\, snoke\\, knights of Ren\\, Luke\\, Rey's parents\\, Kylo's helmet\\, Cpt Phasma..again). The film is also full of wtf moments that make any Star Wars fan want to Wookie Roar in disapproval and rip someones arms off such as the (so called) Leia Superman scene in space\\, Snoke's death and the bomber destruction scene at the begging. The convenience of this film astounds belief...I cannot begin to imagine how i would process this film if i knew nothing about Star Wars (such confused many wow). The film also committs the worst sin known to man... leaving\/changing major parts that featured in a good and well received trailer - see knights of Ren and duck scream thing!","true":true}
