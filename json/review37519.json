Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are two ways to look at this movie.  As a stand-alone film\\, it mostly works.  If you've never seen another Star Wars movie\\, you'll probably think this is pretty good.  I recommend you go see it.  On the other hand\\, even If you're only a casual fan of the series\\, you'll likely wonder what the heck happened here.  And\\, if you really love the Star Wars universe\\, you'll probably leave the theater cursing.  As you can probably tell from my score\\, I'm definitely not in the first (happy) group.  I'm going to skip all the usual (and valid) criticisms of this movie and jump to the one that made me realize I'm 'over' Star Wars.  By the end of this movie\\, everyone that we cared about is dead and\\, more importantly\\, all that they fought for is defeated.  By the end of this movie\\, the good guys are down to just a bare handful.  All the struggle\\, all the sacrifice\\, and all the other movies were a complete waste of time and effort...the good guys were doomed  irregardless.  After watching this movie\\, I realized that the universe could have been no worse a place if Luke had never left his mother's side.  THAT ruined Star Wars for me.  I understand that they made another movie about Han Solo.  That's nice.  I haven't seen it and don't care to.","true":true}
