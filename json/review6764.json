Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don\u2019t listen to the haters. This movie was phenomenal and the crosscutting between the multiple battle scenes during the climax was incredibly well done. There is so much tension in this movie it\u2019s insane and that has been the biggest criticism I\u2019ve heard. All of these people who loved the force awakens say this movie is terrible because of what they did to Luke\u2019s character but everything they did with him was set up in the force awakens. They even reference this in the movie when Luke says \u201cwhat did you expect me to just show up and face down the whole first order with a laser sword\u201d. Luke went into exile out of shame... for him to just return and save the day in the first scene would have been too easy and would have made for no conflict and honestly would\u2019ve just been stupid. If you go into this movie with an open mind you will realize that logically this was the only place for the story to have gone without it being overly predictable and formulaic. Rian Johnson made a lot of bold choices with this movie and I respect him for that and for taking the franchise in a new and fresh direction while still delivering a movie that is overwhelming satisfying and incredibly climactic. I honestly believe this is the best of the franchise followed by TFA and Rogue One. Disney is not killing Star Wars\\, it is resurrecting it. ","true":true}
