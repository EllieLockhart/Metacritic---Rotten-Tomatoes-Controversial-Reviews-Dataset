{"101487":100092,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After watching the Last Jedi\\, I was really thinking about it and it was very difficult to remember stuff I like. This was the case with Force Awakens and Rogue One for me as well\\, but they still felt like Star Wars movies. I am sorry to say that this film has great acting and great action\\, but is still a giant mess. If you haven't seen the film yet\\, click away. I will be going into detail here. First\\, what I liked: Most of the action is pretty great. All the space battles and the final battle on Crait are really exciting. I really liked the casting. The new cast(mainly Benicio Del Toro) was pretty great. And my favorite part of the film was definitely when Snoke died. You didn't expect anything and when Rey and Kylo fought Snoke's guards\\, you really think he has turned good. But\\, you later learn that he is worse than Snoke. And finally\\, Captain Phasma. Her appearance I would have liked to see more\\, but she was pretty awesome when she and Finn battled together. And that's pretty much every good think I have to say. The Last Jedi has a lot of problems. It's not as bad as the worst Star Wars films\\, but is not even close to the best Star Wars films.  First\\, Rey's training by Luke Skywalker was pretty bad. I can't believe that the new Jedi of my generation of Star Wars fans only gets 3 lessons for 1 movie. Even in the prequels\\, the training was actually pretty interesting\\, but Rey's training could have been explored a lot more. Next\\, the film goes on for way too long. As the second longest Star Wars I believe\\, this film has too much stuff going on. It has Rey's training\\, Snoke's death\\, and so much stuff that should happen in episode 9. The humor also doesn't work that well. It was a big surprise how good the humor in Force Awakens and Rogue One was after Jar Jar Binks. Of course\\, there is nothing close to Jar Jar Binks in this film\\, but there is humor that just doesn't give off. And finally\\, I want to talk about the new force powers in the film. Princess Leia gets blown out into space\\, but uses the force to get back on the ship. Most people\\, including myself\\, were expecting Princess Leia's death because of Carrie Fisher's sad death. And the force power was so lame. Why hasn't any been able to save them self from death? There was also force Skype between Kylo and Rey\\, which was dumb. With over $45 million already\\, I'm sure quite a lot of people would enjoy the film. But\\, for me\\, Star Wars has been such a big part of my life and to finally start seeing more movies makes me smile. But\\, when I see a film like this\\, I am pretty disappointed with that film being a follow up to my childhood. Last\\, but not least\\, I have the ranking of all the Star Wars films:\\n1. Empire Strikes Back\\n2. Star Wars(a new hope)\\n3. Force Awakens\\n4. Return of the Jedi\\n5. Revenge of the Sith\\n6. Rogue One\\n7. Last Jedi\\n8. Phantom Menace\\n9. Attack of the Clones\\nIf you enjoyed the movie\\, I am totally fine with that. It's just I didn't. But\\, I am really happy that you have your own opinion. I also might like it if I go watch it again\\, but for now\\, I just find this movie a big disappointment.","true":true}
