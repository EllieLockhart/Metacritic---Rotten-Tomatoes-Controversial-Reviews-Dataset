Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was amazing! Was it different than what I was expecting? Absolutely! Is it a departure for Star Wars as a series? Definitely! But these are not bad things at all this movie was great. The writing\\, directing and acting was superb. Do yourself a favor\\, have an open mind and go see this movie ","true":true}
