Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was disappointed in quite a few things - Casting choices\\, seemingly pointless or drawn out sub plots\\, poor attempts at humor (in my opinion)\\, development of minor characters\\, etc. I was also concerned about what was happening with Luke for the first half of the movie. However\\, ultimately I do believe there were a few powerful scenes that redeemed the film for me. I found the message about learning from failure to be especially poignant and well delivered. I am still very conflicted about what I saw and need to see it again. The film did not turn out the way I would have liked but I believe it is worth a watch (or two) and\\, hopefully\\, episode IX can help provide additional context to complete the new saga.","true":true}
