Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely garbage. The only redeeming quality of this film were the action sequences\\, and even then the Kamikaze scene shatters the consistency of hyperdrive in the Star Wars universe. Disney needs to fire this rabble and hire people who actually care about the lore.","true":true}
