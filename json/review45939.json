Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"VISUALLY AND ON A SCORE BASIS\\, THIS FILM WAS AMAZING. hOWEVER\\, i WOULD ARGUE THIS FILM WAS THE WORST IN THE ENTIRE SERIES. IT WAS EXCITING\\, BUT WHAT WAS THE POINT TO THE ENTIRE FILM? tRAIN REY? SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO GET THREE LESSONS AND GOT ONE (jEDI TAKING YEARS TO TRAIN\\, MIND YOU). WAS IT TO SHOW fINN AND ROSE SAVING THE CRUISER? tHEIR STORYLINE DID NOTHING FOR THE OUTCOME. tHE CONTINUITY WAS HORRIBLE WITH NO REAL SERIOUS DANGER OR CHARACTER DEVELOPEMENT AT ALL. I DIDN'T WATCH THE FILM BEING ABLE TO RELATE OR UNDERSTAND THE MOTIVATIONS OF ANY CHARACTER. \\n\\nWHO IS REY\\, AND WHY IS SHE SO POWERFUL SHE COULD DEFEAT THE GREATEST JEDI IN HISTORY (lUKE)?  \\n\\nTHE FIRST ORDER JUST DESTROYED THE GALACTIC SENATE WHICH OVERSEES TRILLIONS OF CITIZENS\\, TRILLIONS! WHY WAS THERE NOT A MASSIVE FLEET OUT FOR BLOOD AGAINST SNOKE?\\n\\nIF SNOKE WERE SO POWERFUL\\, WHY WAS HE DEFEATED IN THE WAY HE WAS?\\n\\nlAURA dERN IS A GREAT ACTRESS\\, YET HER CHARACTER WAS HORRIBLY WRITTEN. SHE DID INSPIRE ANY CONFIDENCE WHICH IS EVIDENT IN MUTINY BEING PERFORMED UNDER HER LEADERSHIP. aLL SHE WOULD HAVE HAD TO DO IS TELL THE CREW\\, \\\"hEY\\, i KNOW WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF NO WHERE WITH NO PLANETS AROUND US\\, BUT MY PLAN IS TO LOAD EVERYONE ON THE NON-SHIELDED TRANSPORTS WITH ZERO DEFENSES AND HEAD FOR THAT OLD rEBEL BASE \\\"...... THEY ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE AND SENDING THE LAST REFINEMENTS OF THE RESISTANCE INTO TRANSPORTS TO BE PICKED OFF...\\n\\naNYWAYS\\, TOO MANY DISCREPANCIES EXIST FOR ME TO SUSPEND MY DISBELIEF.","true":true}
