Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a life long Star Wars fan I never thought I would be rooting for \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" to fail but I am. The fan rating on Rotten Tomatoes finally falls below 50%. Disney may be convinced this is a success because it is so profitable\\, but I must warn them that many of the most devoted\\, die-hard fans of the series are livid. If Disney allowed a writer\/director to so radically alter fundamental characteristics of Belle like Johnson did to Luke Skywalker there would be riots on Main Street USA at least until they did the fireworks at 9:00 PM. And to what purpose? To show us that our heroes are really not that heroic? Okay fine\\, how about this Disney? Love don't conquer all\\, wishing on a star don't do sh*t. We all know it\\, but we go to Disney World\\, have our kids watch Disney movies\\, and buy Disney toys for them because we wish the real world was as idealistic as the fairytale. Hollywood has long lauded sophomoric cleverness as innovation\\, but let me tell you\\, Disney\\, that the formula for the hero's quest may seem outdated and droll but it has stood the test of time for thousands of years. Until Rian Johnson decided that he knew better...and Disney agreed...and so did the critics. Fortunately\\, the fans--the only honest ones of the bunch--are crying foul. Will anyone hear?","true":true}
