Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoiler Alert! The movie felt like it lead to no where; some of the big questions from the 7th movie we're answered but felt very insignificant. A lot of the jokes made me cringe (especially the opening scene.) I could go on and on about how terrible this Star Wars installment is. Compared to the other movies\\, this is by far the worst. I'm glad JJ Abrams is returning for the 9th movie. Hopefully he can remedy this disaster.","true":true}
