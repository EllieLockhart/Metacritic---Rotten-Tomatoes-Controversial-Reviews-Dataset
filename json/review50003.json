Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You won't fool me\\, nor my money\\, ever again. The sheer audacity to appropriate the Star Wars 'Skywalker' storyline for personal agendas is tacky and irreverent.\\n\\nSPOILERS BELOW:\\n\\nLuke is a potential child murder having attempted to kill his nephew (both his and Kylo's stories corraborate this conclusion) and now lives in solitude on some unknown planet. Han went back to his questionable smuggling lifestyle after RotJ? The \\\"Where are They Now\\\" aspect of this is insulting and the actors never should have signed on for these storylines.\\n\\nLuke : \\\"Chewy -where's Han?\\\" AAANNNNDDD scene transition. Really? A scene transition and no on-screen view of Luke coming to terms with Han's death? Reminds me of TFA when Chewy returns after Han is killed and walks right past Leia. Most tone-deaf scene ever cobbled together - by all means\\, let's instead capture Mary Sue's emotions in dealing with Han's death. NOT Leia and Chewbacca. Unreal.\\n\\nSave your money\\, watch this on premium cable later to see how a studio destroys the most famous film franchise of all time.","true":true}
