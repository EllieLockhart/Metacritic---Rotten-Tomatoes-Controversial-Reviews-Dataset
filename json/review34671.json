Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The contrived nature of the deus ex machina in this film shows how lazy Rian Johnson can be as a director. Ignoring the many sins in this film\\, the acting by the returning cast was phenomenal. However the developed characters took a back seat role in the film\\, while undeveloped characters took the lead... and remained undeveloped or were just killed.","true":true}
