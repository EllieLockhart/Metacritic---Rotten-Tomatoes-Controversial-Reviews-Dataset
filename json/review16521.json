Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In 2017 there have been many movies that were fun and entertaining\\, but not very memorable. The first time I saw this movie I honestly didn't know what to think\\, primarily because there was so much to think about. Instead of creating a passionate knee-jerk reaction\\, I spent the next 48 hours obsessing over what I saw. After a second viewing I can give this film my seal of approval. The Last Jedi doesn't deliver on everything you want to see\\, but it illustrates that not everything we find important is actually important. This latest film continues this space saga about a dysfunctional family in an honest way. Johnson does this while composing some of the most beautiful shots and colors the franchise has ever seen.","true":true}
