Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a star wars film that respects the lore. It's just a remix of the OT. Its money a money grab. 30 something years and we're back to the rebellion vs empire? Everyone from the OT died without achieving anything?\\n\\nFinns story was a waste. \\n\\nSnoke was a waste.\\n\\nTo much humor.\\n\\nIt's a Marvel movie\\, a money grab.","true":true}
