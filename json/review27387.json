Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Our heros took a back seat to a purple hair character who no one knows. Half of the film was unnecessary. Luke was completely wasted and died from thinking too hard. At least let the most powerful jedi die in a real fight.","true":true}
