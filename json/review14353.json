Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I guess the critics love it because it's \\\"edgy\\\" and surprising. I thought it was...tolerable. But the \\\"surprising\\\" turn at the beginning (spoiled by the thousands of interviews saying this was where it was going)\\, succeeds in undercutting the entire premise of Force Awakens plot. Good Job Captain Plot Hole. Bad part is? No one even called Luke out on the glaring inconsistency. \\n\\nOh\\, and *one* person figured out...finally in a Star Wars movie...that fighters wouldn't bank to turn. They'd pivot StarFury Babylon 5 style. Unfortunately\\, it's right before a physics-ignoring moment that's actually WORSE than forgetting fighters wouldn't bank. Sooo...yeah. Consistently inconsistent. And that's pretty much my feeling for the whole movie. Some very good moments. But several of them are gutted by overlong plot arcs (Finn\/Rose\\, stand up)\\, and characters being too stupid to see the obvious.","true":true}
