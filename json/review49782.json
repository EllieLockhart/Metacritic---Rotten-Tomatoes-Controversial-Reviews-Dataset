Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yeah\\, it\u2019s that bad. It\u2019s infuriating to even talk about\\, watching your favorite franchise be destroyed by two people. Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson. The Last Jedi is not Star Wars. As a fan my entire life\\, I was confused\\, bored\\, really confused\\, really bored\\, frustrated\\, and pissed off the entire movie. Just don\u2019t watch it\\, and don\u2019t go see the new movies. Rating: 2\/5 24%","true":true}
