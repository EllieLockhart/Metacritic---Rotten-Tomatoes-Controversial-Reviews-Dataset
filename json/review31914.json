{"101487":169300,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(SPOILER-FREE) Jar Jar would not have been entirely out of place in the newest edition of the Star Wars (SW) canon. Where the Force Awakens (TFA) panders to familiarity and fan expectations\\, the Last Jedi (TLJ) plays it fast and loose with SW lore. The irony is that for all the twists\\, newness and upended fan theories\\, it feels a lot like other Disney properties (specifically\\, Marvel co-ops: Thor\\, Guardians of the Galaxy\\, the Avengers\\, etc.): roller coaster ride fight scenes\\, knowing glances\\, punched-up \\\"witty\\\" banter and lifeless CGI. What should feel fresh\\, feels preserved and homogenized. On more than one occasion\\, I found myself day-dreaming during repetitive space battles\\, replaying scenes and thinking how they could have been executed in more interesting ways or how a genius editor like Marcia Lucas could have tightened this mess up\\, much like I did while watching the prequels. I read a few of the spoiler-free reviews prior to seeing the film\\, and can't help thinking they must have watched a different film. Contrary to most reviews\\, the twists and turns felt oddly predictable and familiar\\, and the story far from \\\"complex\\\": Jar Jar would have been at home in this world of superfluous CGI characters and absent character arcs.","true":true}
