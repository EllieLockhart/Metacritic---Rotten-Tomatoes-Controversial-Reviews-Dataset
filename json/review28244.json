Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poorly written\\, terrible story decisions. If it weren't a Star Wars movie\\, it would be getting the bad reviews it deserves. Tired of being expected to enjoy crappy movies just because they're Star Wars.","true":true}
