Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As the final credits rolled\\, I was left with conflicting feelings of awe and disappointment: this was certainly not the starwars film I had expected. However\\, after leaving the theater and having had some time to think on it\\, I realized that this was the best possible outcome. Rian Johnson has truly crafted a worthy Star Wars film that tells a very original story that is (especially throughout Rey and Luke's Arce) absolutely satisfying. \\n\\nThere were certainly some throw-away characters (sorry Rose) and even entire arcs that felt pretty pointless. I was especially disappointed that it seemed like Finn had very little to do for most of the film. But in the end\\, the entire action-packed thrill ride that the movie ends up being is more than the sum of its parts. I'm glad that Johnson didn't go with the easy plot twists that it seemed a lot of the audience wanted to see\\, but instead made something very original while still feeling like the classic films that we love so much.","true":true}
