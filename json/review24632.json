Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie was a damn travesty. So so many things wrong with it. Spit on the Star Wars saga. Did no justice to old characters we all love. Sacrificed epic Starwars story telling for political agenda views\\, social justice warrior crap in order to sell kids toys and put Starwars logo on everything from paper towels to tissue paper for us to clean off the huge dump horrible Kathleen Kenedy\\, Ryan Johnson and Disney took all over this beloved tale. I'm finished with Disneys Starwars. It's ruined beyond repair now. Damn you George Lucas for giving Starwars to them! Damn you!!!!!!! P.S. Kathleen Kenedy please burn in hell forever!!!!","true":true}
