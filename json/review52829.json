Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A lot of people have a lot of valid problems with the film\\, and yes\\, it does wobble a bit in some places. However\\, it's a film that sees you can't please everyone\\, so it goes in a direction Star Wars hasn't before\\, going a little darker with welcome boosts in tone at points. As all Star Wars films\\, it has flaws\\, but it's a damn good film throughout\\, better on second viewing.","true":true}
