Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While I thought the cinematography was amazing and the acting was good\\, I really liked the scenes with Rey and Kilo I can help but feel they trashed Luke making him look week\\, there was also really bad plot holes\\, how do you drop bombs in space? How could Laya get sucked out into space and then after just Supermaning herself back to the ship and opens the door and no one else gets sucked out they just stand there? The whole plot with Fin was just stupid and felt out of place never mind that it would have never happened if the purple hair chick just told people their plan to sneak away to the old base. I felt they tried to destroy the theme and feel of what made Star Wars so successful.","true":true}
