Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not as good\\, as I thought. A lot of question unanswered and wont be answered.  Do not know where this movie will lead to\\, there is no cliffhanger. A lot of similarities to Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. A whole sub plot did not even need to be in the movie\\, nothing came of it.  Overall\\, this movie is not what fans were hoping for.","true":true}
