Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\,\\\" is arguably one of the best movies of 2017. I've been waiting for this movie since I walked out of \\\"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\\,\\\" two years back. The movie hooked me on the edge of my seat until the very end. \\nThe acting from the cast were outstanding (including the new characters like DJ\\, Rose\\, etc.) they gave it their all in this film. The visual effects look beautiful than before\\, the lightsabers look dazzling and makes every scene look awesome. The soundtrack composed by John Williams was another masterpiece\\, just like all of his other scores from Star Wars. The story was better than TFA\\, but because it's very emotional and has plenty of unexpected plot twists. The ending was much different than what Star Wars usually ends their films\\, leaving some story for Episode IX to fill in. \\nOverall\\, \\\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\,\\\" is the best installment in the Star Wars saga since Empire Strikes Back. It's also a perfect movie to end Carrie Fisher's career and role as the popular icon Leia Organa. Go see this movie in theaters while you can\\, if you love Star Wars or dark emotional movies\\, go see \\\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi.\\\"","true":true}
