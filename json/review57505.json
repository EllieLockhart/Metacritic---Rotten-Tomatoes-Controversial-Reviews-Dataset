Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a bad movie and even worse Star Wars -movie\\, in my opinion.\\nI do get what they were after with this one\\, and it could have worked\\, if done properly\\, but this one was just a huge mess.. it changed Luke in a massive way\\, that just doesn't make any sense. It could have made sense with a better back story\\, but it didn't. Why? Well\\, Kylo (or Ben) is the son of Leia and Han\\, so why didn't they change when he just decided to off \\\"everybody\\\" and turn to the dark side? At least not that much... yeah they split up\\, but still remained the same when it comes to their nature. But then Luke\\, who insisted that Vader could change back\\, who never gave up\\, just suddenly got scared of a young boy (yeah yeah\\, who is strong in the force\\, so was Vader\/Anakin)\\, thought of even killing him to prevent him going to the dark side? Yeah right... \\n\\nBUT\\, that's not the only or even the biggest reason why I don't like this movie. It had so many unnecessary scenes and jokes\\, jumped all over the place\\, many characters lacked depth and so on and so on... even the timeline didn't add up\\, or did I miss something? Also\\, why use force \\\"stuff\\\" that's only been seen in games and maybe in some other stories? Not all people are gamers (or not even big readers)\\, so it kind of makes things confusing and inconsistant\\, especially when they do use characters from the previous movies. Which brings me to this; if you want to change the sw -universe and make it your own\\, just don't use old characters\\, simple as that.\\n\\nOh\\, and what about Leia floating in space\\, that was such a HORRIBLE scene... akward = the best word to describe the feeling I got... And don't even get me started on Rey\\, could there be a more boring character? She's way too perfect. I really hope Kylo was lying about her parents! A more interesting back story could explain some of her abilities\\, but if there really is none...\\n\\nAlso Snoke and all the other \\\"bad\\\" guys were a huge disappointment. Kylo is ok\\, but too impulsive to feel actually intimidating.\\n\\nI could go on and on about the things that made me hate this movie from my very core\\, but I'm too tired to write more\\, so I'll leave it at this.\\n\\nOne star for Poe\\, love his character and storyline!","true":true}
