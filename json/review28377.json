Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Possibly the largest problem with this film is that it actively tries to work against the groundwork laid out by the previous installment\\, and instead tries to forge a new narrative direction; which leaves the audience with a sense of narrative whiplash. \\n- Snoke\\, the looming great evil in the shadows is never explored as a character; and is quickly thrown away in favor of Kylo Ren as the main antagonist. \\n- The character arc for Finn from The Force Awakens is thrown away and Finn has to relearn having to stand and fight; instead of running away. But even this is put at odds with Poe's character arc at the end of the film.\\n- The Force Awakens largely centered around finding and controling the map Luke Skywalker left behind that revealed his location in exile; however The Last Jedi reveals a bitter old man who came to that island to die.  Why seek out the first Jedi Temple\\, to go back to the roots of everything you stand for\\, to leave a map for people to find you\\, and then when someone does find you reveal that you came there to die and that you closed yourself off from the force entirely.  They had Luke come one of the greatest natural sources of the Light & Dark side\\, only to shut himself off from it. That would be like me moving to New York City and try to live off grid and away from human civilization. \\n- You had the original hero of the story Luke Skywalker-who stopped at nothing to save a father who cut off his hand\\, who time and again stood against him\\, who everyone told him was evil to the core\\, who turned him by believing in the slightest bit of light & good still there buried beneath-you had that Luke Skywalker decide that because there was a chance Ben Solo could go to the dark side that he needed to be killed. That is a character assassination of Luke Skywalker. \\n- The Knights of Ren were dropped completely.\\n- The shields for the ships were not even consistent throughout the film.\\n- General Hux\\, Admiral Holdo and several military personnel and leaders were acting completely contrary to how a normal trained leaders would act in those situations. The head of command gives orders to their subordinates and those subordinates do the same down the chain of command. So it does not surprise me that Admiral Purple Hair was mutinied by her own soldiers. \\n\\nI can go on and on and on\\, but this movie is trying so hard to be its own thing and to provide its own message & identity-to be a deconstruction of everything we the audience felt we knew...while being the second film in the new trilogy.  The road was laid out\\, you had creative freedom to do with any of the plot threads The Force Awakens gave you; but instead this film spent so much time getting rid of them and working against the grain.\\n\\nI don't care that fan's theories were wrong or that you decided to explore new tonal directions for the franchise; just make a good movie sequel that continues the dang story.\\n\\nThe foundation of a good story is there-but the narrative inconsistencies are too jarring to be able to view this film as it is supposed to be: a sequel to The Force Awakens.","true":true}
