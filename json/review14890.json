Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just seen Hans Solo..yes you heard me.  I have a time machine cause I'm rich\\, ..if you love the last jedi... wait till you see the  next 3 installation Disney have in  store!  the trailer for Boba Fett is awesome!","true":true}
