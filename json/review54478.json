Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Love that Star Wars is changing! The anger of fans with this film no doubt comes down to the shattering of their expectations with the Skywalker line. This film does things other Star Wars films haven't. And because of it\\, we get what I've been waiting for since Disney bought Lucasfilm: We're seeing Star Wars break from it's mold. We're seeing it stop pandering to nostalgia. TFA and Rogue One had to do this to lure everyone in and then BAM! here comes The Last Jedi. A fantastic romp with deep characterization. It's all bad people. Everyone fails. That's an act two for you. Can't wait for act three!","true":true}
