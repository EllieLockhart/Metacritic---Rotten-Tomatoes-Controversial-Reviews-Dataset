Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Brilliant visuals\\, epic sound\/music\\, good acting.... overshadowed by disastrous and divisive story telling. There is a blatant feminist and \\\"progressive\\\" agenda that was destined to divide those who watched it\\, coupled with complete disregard for devoted fans of the franchise most invested the main plot points particularly from The Force Awakens.\\n\\nIf you like cool sci-fi\/space battles\\, the occasional laugh and cute animals you'll like this movie\\, if you're invested in the Star Wars story and hoped for a continuation of it to include plot points of substance and awe you will be severely and bitterly let down. Equally if you're sick of far left ideology infecting every aspect of your daily life like politics\\, media\\, the workplace and sport you will also struggle to enjoy this movie.\\n\\nAll I have to say is how sad I am that even in a galaxy far\\, far away we can't escape Earths suffocating and bitter political divide anymore and just enjoy a story we ALL loved. Thanks for that Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy\\, thanks a lot.\\n\\nDisney if you could grant me one wish\\, just one wish\\, it would be this; please\\, PLEASE do not let them or anyone like them to ever be involved with another Star Wars film again and replace them with talented producers and storywriters who are not only Star Wars fans but also have no (I repeat; NO) political or social affiliations. NONE.","true":true}
