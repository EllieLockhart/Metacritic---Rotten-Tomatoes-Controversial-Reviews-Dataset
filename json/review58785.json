Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I know for some people the last 3 months of our quarantine have been rough but this game has been like a rainbow after the Storm. I have missed Ellie and Joel! The Last of Us has been one of my favorite games for a long time since then I've played it at least seven times I am so eager to finish part 2. I don't mind Ellie being gay but I feel that it is straight up in your face the entire game. If Ellie was straight and had a boyfriend constantly bumping into me I would feel the same way. The Last of Us is not a romantic love story but a \\\"father-daughter\\\" relationship based on trust and hardship. I feel that Ellie nor Joel's sexual preference should be a side story in this storyline. Ellie's girlfriend has less personality than a plank of wood and really could have played the game without her. We should have had more time with Joel but I also understand they needed to move the story along. The nostalgia in this game is one I hold close to my heart. I love how some things have not changed such as the way we upgrade guns\\, search for loot\\, take medicine for upgrades\\, and the menu and how you make medkits and bombs. I love the collectibles and how Ellie writes everything in her journal. I think naughty dog did awesome with the graphics and show how time passes but the world stayed the same.The handling of the characters could use some work. I hate how Ellie jumps and the noises she makes. I'm glad they kept the same type of \\\"infected\\\" and impressed with the new.I like how they opened up the map especially in Seattle up I just wish they had a better navigation system. I don't like the fact that if I miss something I can't go back.  Overall I am very pleased with this game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
