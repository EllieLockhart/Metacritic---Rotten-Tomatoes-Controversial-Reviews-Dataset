Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappoints\\, Although visually stunning at times the story\\, pacing and character development are all over the place and almost non existent. This is the first time I think I left the theatre indifferent to a Star Wars movie.  Not terrible\\, but not good either. Just a mediocre movie with some nice effects. Kills a couple of hours \\, Not worth a second viewing.","true":true}
