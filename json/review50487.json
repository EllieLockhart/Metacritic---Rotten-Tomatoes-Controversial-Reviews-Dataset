{"101487":96818,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-10","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"1\/2 star and voting \\\" not Interested not included into the RT totals \\\"\\n\\nThe system for the voting % here on Rotten Tomatos\\, a score of \\\" 1\/2 star \\\" or \\\" not interested \\\" is not included into RT tracking system ??\\n\\nI read that\\, and wanted to make sure my vote is included\\, so moved up from 1\/2 a start to 1 star... still negative\\, but I hope will add to the totals.\\n\\nI see now it is 48%\\, a move in the right direction\\, but still not accurate.\\n\\nThis is a new low for me as a person.  I am the sort of person that encourages people\\, I give praise to people\\, I try to motivate\\, I try never to be a negative person or see anyone or anything in a bad  light\\, I dont put people down. But with this movie\\, I am very happy to see it fall\\, and I do hope the % falls much\\, much  lower\\, so Kathllen Kennedy and Ryan Johnson get it through their heads\\, that  this is not a few...\\\"butt hurt fans\\\"  crying the blues.... but the vast majority that cant stand this train wreck movie.\\n\\nYou people giving 5 star reviews\\, with no explantions are funny. if your happy fooling yourself\\, all the power to you\\, but your not fooling anyone else.  If you legitimately  like this movie\\, why cant you say anything beyond \\\" wow great movie ! Best ever ! \\\" Or some such nonsense\\, why not list point by point what you liked\\, fill us in\\, as most of us obviously did not see what you did.\\n\\nHonestly\\, I think 90% of the 5 star reviews on here are internet trolls that like  dispute everything...just for fun.  Or...as the rumor suggests it is disney \/ kathleen k people being told to go make accounts to post positive reviews.   \\n\\nThis seems beyond crazy\\, as they are going to need a lot of false 5 star reviews to  push up the % to anything positive.\\n\\nIt is a garbage movie\\, and there is no way to sugar coat it. You can not wrap up shit\\, and sell it as chocolate and expect people to buy it in droves. No matter how many fake people you bully into saying \\\" best chocolate ever ! \\\"  it is still shit\\, and you cant hide that fact. Shit is shit\\, and this movie is shit. This is not only my opinion but now millions of  peoples opinions.\\n\\n\\nI saw a comment that indicated Ryan and Kathleen are belittle any person that does not \\\" get the great wonderful message \\\" that is in the movie. We are called \\\"racists\\,  misogynists\\, old and out of touch and 2 steps below retard \\\"  I suppose this would have validity if it was only \\\"stupid old white angry women hating men\\\"  making comments and videos about this movie. If you take the time to see youtube videos you find young\\, old\\, asian\\, black\\, women\\, men intelectuals and blue colar...all with a negative opinion. \\n\\nAll the people hating this movie do not fit into the same demographic. \\n\\nIts actualy insulting.\\n\\nWhat is the problem with Kathleen Kennedy and Ryan Johnson and Disney not coming forward to say \\\" wow we made a mistake\\, we fucked up\\, we are so sorry\\\"  Shame on all of you for not letting go of your pride\\, to do the honest thing and step forward and say you made a mistake. \\n\\nIs it more honorable ...to try to pass the blame onto the fans\\, and try to make them think there is something wrong with them\\, for not loving this movie to death.\\n\\nThats about as twisted and narcissistic as it gets.\\n\\nSo the great messages in the movie\\, that come to mind for me upon reflection are as follows.\\n\\nLets start with Luke. The great message is \\n\\n\\\" if you fail....abandon your family\\, your friends\\, everything you care about and ...run away and hide in shame..forever  as a coward \\\"\\n\\nwow... great message.\\n\\nRey the great message here....\\n\\nEverything should be easy\\, you should not need education\\, expierence  or  training you should be 100% perfect and get everything you want...... just because you are entitiled.\\n\\nWe need more people to feel  they are owed everything? No more start at the bottom and work your way up? just start at the top ?\\n\\nThe casino planet message is...\\n\\n\\\"All weathy people are evil\\, and can not be trusted...\\\"\\n\\nThis is funny...I laughed when I thought about the idiocy of this part of the movie. Disney executives\\, and Kathleen Kennedy make more money in one day\\, than you and I \\, and likely 98% of the people reading this will make in 1 year.   But they would have us think...they are not part of the wealthy elite..and thus...are not the bad people\\, similar to the rich people portrayed in the movie ?   \\n\\nGive me a break.\\n\\nSocial  messages\\, horrible writting\\, idiotic humor\\, lazy character development.  I found I could not care if any of the characters lived or died as I watched the movie...I was numb from the sheer stupidity.\\n\\nHow\\, was this ever given a green light\\, for approval on the script and for filming? I have no clue how it survivedthe edit process....I think i would have cut out 95% of the movie. I am at a loss\\, it is so horrible\\, and no one at disney picked up on it and said  \\\" oh..my god.... \\\" and stoped it before it was released. The only thing \\\" star wars\\\" about this movie is its name.\\n\\nIt is all to obvious Disney and Kathleen Kennedy  must have  thought star wars fans are stupid\\, and will buy into whatever shit  they give to us\\, because it is \\\" star wars \\\". \\n\\nFool me once\\, shame on you\\, fool me twice shame on me.\\n\\nDisney\\, and Lucas films need to decide on some new leadership in regards to the direction of star wars. Because if this is the new way to do things\\, the days of big money returns for anything star wars will be long\\, long  gone. \\n\\nWhat a waste.","true":true}
