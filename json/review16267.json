Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not even gonna do a write up for this trash.\\n\\nOnly redeeming quality is Rey is a solid character.\\n\\nLeia in space ha.\\n\\nFinn and rose were pointless.(the new jar jar binks?)\\n\\nLuke was such a great character. Even if hamil like this Luke's ending it does not compare to his original story line. Would like to see a book adaptation and see how that would compare to this trilogy...","true":true}
