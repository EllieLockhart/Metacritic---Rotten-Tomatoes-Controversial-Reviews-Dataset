Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a longtime SW fan and tolerated the direction with SW:TFA but Last Jedi was terrible.  It certainly did not \\\"deliver emotion-rich action\\\" or \\\"honor the legacy\\\" as RT puts it!  I likely won't see another SW at theatres again since they slide garbage like this out and then called it \\\"92%! Fresh!\\\" - critics must be getting paid to peddle this.","true":true}
