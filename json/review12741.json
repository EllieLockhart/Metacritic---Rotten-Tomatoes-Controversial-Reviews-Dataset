Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I created an account juts to let people know how much this movie sucked huge venouse cock... so many stupid unnecessary scenes and poor acting\\, a guy literally licked the goddam soil to let us know the planet is made of salt!!!!! Like wtf!? Overplayed jokes the same little furry monster yelling like 5 times! We get it hes cute its funny but 5 different occasions!? The most awkward cringey unnecessary kiss of all time wtf was that about... also who the fuck was snoke!? Where did he come from !? Why was he there !? Why was he so stupid !? Was he the dumbest sith of all time!? Kylo litetally says \\\"you have no part in this story\\\" to Rae like what!?!? Might as well just loo at the camera and wink while youre at it... the god awfulness of this movie is just too much to fit in one paragraph","true":true}
