Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great film.  I thought it was more similar to Empire Strikes Back than others did.  The theme of ESB was failure and learning from your mistakes\\, so is the theme of this movie. Can\u0092t wait to see where they go with the next film.","true":true}
