Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't expect anything in this movie to written well... jokes\\, plots\\, characters\\, relationships\\, story line whatsoever... everything you have always loved about Star Wars is abandoned in this film. Beyond disppointing. If it hadn't been Star Wars we would have walked out. Sooooo many issues with this and as a true fan\\, do not know where to begin. Consider yourself warned... (Well done Disney... Worse than Episode I) Sigh.","true":true}
