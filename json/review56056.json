Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So\\, I saw The Last Jedi and while I didn't dislike it\\, it wasn't anything too special. ***SPOILERS*** The whole movie is set around the resistance trying to escape the First Order\\, while the First Order keeps tracking and pummeling them with cannons. That's basically it because the subplots that accompany it generally lead to nothing. The entire Finn and Rose subplot was completely pointless in the large scheme of things as Laura Dern's character just sacrifices herself to allow the remaining resistance to land on Crait. This renders the subplot pointless since the whole point of it was to turn off the tracker to allow the resistance to escape. Also\\, Rei trying to persuade Kylo Ren to the light simply fizzles out at its conclusion.\\nThen\\, there is Supereme Leader Snoke. Who was Snoke? Where did he come from? How did he rise to power? I guess now we will never know because he's a corpse.\\nAll in all it was far from as good as the original trilogy and I would even say that The Force Awakens is better too. It IS better than the prequel trilogy and Rogue One though for sure.","true":true}
