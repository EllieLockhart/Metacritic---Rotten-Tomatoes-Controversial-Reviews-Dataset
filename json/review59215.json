But if you like plots where the story is true to the lore of the world built by authors then this will be a masterpiece.

But if you like plots where the story is true to the lore of the world built by authors then this will be a masterpiece. It stays true to the post apocalyptic world of the last of us.The sound is awesome\\, combat music and voice acting are better than award winning movies.The graphics for the most part seems like next gen visuals.The gameplay takes cues from mgs 5 and its pretty varied and intense on higher difficulties. Enemies are very aggressive and don't seem dumb on hard and survivor. However i was able to break the AI twice in the game. Gun play feels very good; gun variety is also present. Skill trees although half of them are meaningless\\, its a welcome addition for replay value on new game plus to completely level up .The game length is also decent clocking around 31 hours on my first play through on hard. New game plus is a welcome addition.Game also contains extras like concept art and character models if you like those things.Performance on the base ps4 launch version was very impressive with almost no frame rate dips. Encountered frame rate issues once but it was gone once the game was restarted.Almost zero bugs in the game. Encountered one buggy shimmy animation in my 60 hours with the game.SUMMARY:GRAPHICS : 9.5GAMEPLAY : 9.5SOUND MUSIC AND VOICE : 10PERFORMANCE AND STABILITY : 10REPLAY VALUE AND GAME LENGTH : 7STORY : 9AVERAGE : 9\/10\u2026 Expand","true":true}
