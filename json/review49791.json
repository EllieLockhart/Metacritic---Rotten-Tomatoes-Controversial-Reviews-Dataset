Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yeah\\, this was not the best Star Wars movie ever.  If you have the ability to go see the movie on a \\\"special day\\,\\\" i.e. $5 Tuesday make it happen\\, it is worth seeing once on the big screen\\, but not for full price.  You can read all the political and feminist blah blah blah posts\\, but really I just didn't connect with the film.  I have seen every Star Wars film multiple times\\, and while it has some characters I know\\, I can't help but feel that this is some other film series that they are just making cameos in.  I will say I wouldn't want to be Rian Johnson at any fan function any time soon.","true":true}
