Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie is getting unfair backlash. This movie is not perfect but at least isn't afraid to take risks and try and push the franchise forward. I would argue this movie only makes one or two \\\"errors\\\" that aren't found in the original trilogy. My biggest complaint honestly was how small they made the first order and resistance feel by the end of the movie. It feels like a small skirmish more than a galactic wide struggle. Overall good though and it makes me wonder if SW fans even know what they want. TFA was too derivative. TLJ was too different. I swear the target area fans want Disney to hit is only two meters wide. That's impossible.","true":true}
