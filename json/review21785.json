Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just....bad. There was so much to explore coming out of The Force Awakens and its all thrown away. Luke's character arc indefensible. No character development for anyone else. No real story.  Too many flaws to list. I was squirming in my seat in the first 5 minutes and it didn't get better. Disney. You've mastered how a cohesive story works with Marvel. What went wrong? So...so disappointed.","true":true}
