Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved the Last Jedi!  I've seen it twice\\, and I'll admit that the first viewing it took me about 45 minutes to get up to speed with the story.  The second viewing was much better.  There's a lot going on this movie\\, definitely need multiple viewing to absorb it all.","true":true}
