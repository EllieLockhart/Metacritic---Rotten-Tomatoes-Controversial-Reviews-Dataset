Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(Spoiler Free)\\nThe Worst Star Wars Film\\nStarts out with a kinda stupid joke\\, setting a unsettling tone for the rest of a pretty dark themed movie.\\nHas unnecessary subplots and characters.\\nVillains are stupid and unmenacing.\\nLeft the movie very conflicted.\\nHas plot holes that makes the movie worse the more you think about it.\\nIts not a carbon copy of Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back.\\nWould be better as a copy of The Empire Strikes Back.\\nExecution of the revelation of Rey's parents was done poorly.\\nNo background of how Snoke or almost anything really.\\nSciFi\/Star Wars rules were broken.(Shields nonexistent) Hyperspace as a weapon.\\nMakes Force Awakens and the prequels look better.","true":true}
