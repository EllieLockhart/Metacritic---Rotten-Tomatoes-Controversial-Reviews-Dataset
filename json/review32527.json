Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi completely ruins the story arc of Luke Skywalker from the original trilogy\\, as well as destroying any of the questions or mysteries left over from The Force Awakens in a poorly attempted way to try and write out things they had no idea how to answer. The only question I have for this series is\\, how are you going to get me to care about Episode IX?","true":true}
