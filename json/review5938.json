Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing movie\\, basically the bad guys never succeed in anything they try to do\\, so after the first scene or two you know how the movie goes. Kylo Ren is the only saving grace\\, the actor behind him is pretty believable even if hobbled by the script\\, was not impressed with the acting of most of the rest of the cast. This series has become a cash cow\\, nothing else.","true":true}
