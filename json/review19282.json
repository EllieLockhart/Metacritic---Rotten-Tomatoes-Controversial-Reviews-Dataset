Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's not perfect but it does NOT deserve this fan  score. Fanboys butthurt by the theories they got wrong. I understand some plot holes were there but it deserves better than 57. Rian Johnson was bold and creative with this movie and he should be proud of his work. He made this series innovative and subverted the common tropes of the Star Was saga. Adam Driver\\, Daisy Ridley and Mark Hamil should also be proud with their outstanding acting. I suggest to watch it twice. It gets even better!","true":true}
