Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved everything about this movies the good parts\\, the \\\"bad\\\" parts\\, the ones that didn't make sense but I the thing I loved the most were the answers to the questions the last movie left us with like (SPOILERS):\\n Rey being the balance to Kylo (Explaining her powers)\\, Kylos origings and Luke throwing his ligth saber was hillarious","true":true}
