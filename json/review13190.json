{"101487":131166,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-27","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't think I can speak highly enough about The Last Jedi\\, Rian Johnson's passionate tribute to the Star Wars saga. This movie is so intelligent\\, thoughtful\\, self-aware\\, books can be written about it\\, but I'm going to keep it short. I can easily understand why the movie has been so divisive\\, especially if you consider two years filled with speculations\\, theories and growing expectations. Some fans expected to find these fulfilled within the story and that's where all the fuss is coming from. After all\\, one of the themes of the movie is the disillusion of facing your idols\\, when the idea you constructed of them slowly fades to reveal flawed\\, ordinary human beings. If we stay inside this metaphor\\, the entire Star Wars franchise is the idol\\, and we must come to terms with its changes and innovations. We're just discovering new rules\\, not breaking the old ones. \\nThe dense weave of references and parallels with the prequels and the original trilogy are abundant but not redundant\\, closely reminiscent of the epithets and the other formulaic expressions used in ancient epic poems\\, in a way that cements Star Wars structure as one of an epic tale in space\\, that also draw fully from archetypal themes and motifs\\, mostly derived from Jungian psychology\\, such as the dynamic between Anima and Animus and the importance of the Shadow\\, or from eastern imagery (see the Yin and Yang\\, showed both on a visual and on a narrative level). The intentional and conscious symbolism used adds to the reasons that make it a good and powerful narrative. You must dig down and look under the surface to find out how deep and meaningful and rich the story really is\\, at how many levels it can speak to you. Everything is covered by almost two hours and a half of movie: universal themes such as regret\\, guilt\\, loneliness\\, abandonment\\, abuse\\, manipulation\\, growth\\, love\\, failure\\, masculinity and femininity\\, sexuality\\, the relationship between master and apprentice\\, past and future\\, light and dark\\, the seek for identity and belonging\\, they all find a place in the movie. And the answers the movie gives to the questions the different characters pose throughout the story\\, rather than obeying to a black and white morality\\, are not that predictable and they brought us towards grey\\, which is also the color the heroine choose for her outfit when she is finally beginning to accept the hard truth about her past\\, realizing that that's not where her worth comes from. Everything is exquisitely nuanced\\, not a single detail is left meaningless - and that's a lot for a movie that overflows with details. Even the infamous scene where Kylo Ren shows us how shredded he is\\, is there with the purpose of serving the narrative: it shows us\\, through Rey's eyes ( and the perfect correspondence between Rey's eyes and the audience's eyes within the movie is remarkable)\\, how human he is\\, enlightening at the same time the dynamic of their relationship ( they are clearly attracted to each other) and freeing him for a brief moment from his gravity and the aura of tragic Greek hero in favor of a lighter atmosphere (in preparation of a bigger turn for the next episode? The long-awaited redemption maybe? Who knows!). Rian Johnson can toss a wink to the female audience but\\, to quote our beloved Luke Skywalker\\, \\\"it's so much bigger\\\". The director cleverly drew from \\\"the heroine's journey\\\"\\, giving us a story told from the female perspective (for the ones who can recognize the symbols scattered throughout the movie)\\, visually stunning (one word: Crait.) and convincing story-wise.\\nIf The Force Awakens represents the childhood of our heroes\\, The Last Jedi is about adolescence and its challenges which must be overcome and the director explores these difficulties and the turmoil focusing all his energies on characters development\\, succeeding in giving the old heroes a good and meaningful departure to make room for the new ones\\, but without forgetting that they are the roots from which they grow. Luke\\, despite initially rejecting his last \\\"call to adventure\\\"\\, eventually reveals himself as the same merciful boy who tossed his saber and decided not to fight his father\\, allowing his nephew to vent his anger in a harmless way that protects the light still left in him and acknowledging his crying need for apologies. Finn goes from selfish and reluctant renegade stormtrooper to heroic selfless warrior\\, willing to sacrifice himself for a greater cause. He is involved in one of the snazziest sequences\\, set in the opulent casino city of Canto Bight\\, a true gem inside the movie which totally immerses us in a new piece of the galaxy\\, after the Mos Eisley Cantina and Maz's castle scenes. Poe\\, at the beginning reckless and insubordinate\\, abandons the Spartan ideal of the beautiful and heroic death and gradually learns to see the big picture. They all seem to fail in what they intended to do but the ones who think the twists and turns are purposeless for this reason\\, are totally missing the point.  Failure is the greatest source of wisdom and growth and that is also true for our protagonists\\, whose crackling chemistry has reached new heights in this movie\\, thanks to the beautifully subtle portrayal of the two actors: Kylo Ren and Rey.\\nShe's so naive\\, inquisitive\\, forgiving\\, strong but also fragile\\, impulsive - that is maybe her biggest flaw - but willing to double-check her most rushed decisions. They managed to create a beautiful\\, complex and multidimensional female character\\, whose strength is not diminished by her vulnerability and who\\, as her male counterpart\\, Kylo Ren\\, a response to the stifling image of toxic masculinity\\, is allowed to cry and show emotions and can simultaneously kick asses and let go herself to the tenderness of a blooming love. And it feels so real. Her power lies in her determination\\, in the eagerness to discover\\, try and learn\\, in questioning the reality that surrounds her\\, in her stubbornness\\, bravery\\, openness. And Daisy Ridley displays all of this brilliantly. Despite being apparently her opposite\\, he is flawed\\, broken\\, sad\\, unsure and vulnerable in the same way. There is innocence and wonder in him too\\, something the people around him are trying to repress. He's young as her\\, even if\\, like her but in a different way\\, he was forced to grew up too fast. He's been traumatized and brainwashed and struggles to recover from his internal wounds. Feeling betrayed by his own blood he was an easy prey for Snoke\\, who manipulated him for years. He's starved of affection and latch onto her\\, with whom he shares an intense loneliness and abandonment issues. They connect with each other on a deeper level\\, forming an unbreakable bond in the Force that allows them to understand one another profoundly\\, becoming protective and attached. The mirror scene in the cave couldn't have been more blatant in showing how they recognize themselves in each other and how their destinies are intertwined. Kylo Ren\\, in his brutal honesty\\, is the one that's really trying to help her\\, the one who pushes her figuring out who she really is\\, how important she is despite coming from nowhere\\, how much she can achieve. He is more of an antihero than a villain\\, with Byronic traits and Adam Driver's performance is astonishing in his use of every facial muscle to depict his character's emotions. At the end they are at odds again and they both have made mistakes\\, but is natural for the middle chapter of a story to reach its lowest point. If the ultimate goal of this new trilogy is the balance\\, their dynamic is where we have to look for. Defeating Snoke has set an even harder task for the former Ben Solo\\, that is face his greatest enemy: himself. And even if you need help from the others\\, the healing has to start from yourself. Rey's rejection was necessary for him in order to realize that. \\nI'd like to end with the simple words of the newcomer\\, Rose Tico\\, which is by far the greatest and most powerful message of the movie: \\\"That's how we're gonna win\\, not fighting what we hate\\, but saving what we love.\\\"","true":true}
