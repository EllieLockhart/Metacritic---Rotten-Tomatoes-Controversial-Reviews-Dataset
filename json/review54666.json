Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In the screening we attended the entire crowd erupted in applause and cheers three times. I go to the opening screenings of a lot of these event movies and you might get some cheers come credit time every so often\\, but it's rare for it to occur like it did last night. There were also several times when the entire auditorium gasped out loud. No one was talking at the film. It was intense and you felt everyone was completely in the zone. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen the entire time.\\n\\nAre there problems with the movie? Of course. There always are and there will always be. The question should be are these problems structural\/script\/plot\/style\/story related or are they based on your own expectations. If you hate a movie based on what you wanted it to be rather than what it actually is\\, whose fault is it?\\n\\nI don't know for sure. One thing I do know is that it was a wildly satisfying ride for me and the people I watched it with. If they tell you differently\\, well\\, I guess cheering and applauding stuff they hate is their thing.\\n\\nI loved it\\, problems and all. And the only thing that matters more to me than that was whether or not Serenity loved it. As soon as the credits started and the cheering stopped\\, she leaned over to me and said\\, \\\"Well\\, I have a new favorite Star Wars movie!\\\"\\n\\n'Nuff said.","true":true}
