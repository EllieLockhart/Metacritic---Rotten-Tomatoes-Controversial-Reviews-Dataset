Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't say enough about how great this was.  Every scene was compelling to me.  The suspenseful opening fight sequence.  Luke teaching Rey to use the Force.  The intimate \\\"Force time\\\" scenes with Rey and Kylo.  The amazing lightsaber battle against Snoke's guards.  The urgency of Finn and Rose's mission to disable the First Order's hyperspace tracking system.  Luke's climactic battle with Kylo.  Rey clearing a path for the resistance to escape.  The beautiful score accompanying every scene.  The hopeful ending showing a new\\, young Force user.  I loved every second of this movie\\, and if you can forget about any pre-conceived notions you may have had going in then you will too!","true":true}
