Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just...terrible. For several days now I have been trying to think of something positive about this movie\\, but I simply can't. Every aspect of this film could have been written better. It was just lazy and pathetic storytelling which totally betrayed the mythos of Star Wars. George Lucas recieved a lot of criticism for his altering of the original movies and for the prequel trilogy\\, but at least all of that was recognizably \\\"Star Wars\\\". I'm sorry George. I wish you still had control.","true":true}
