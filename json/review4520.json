Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Childhood heroes: ruined.  Star Wars: destroyed.  And for what?  So that Disney could give us a film that spends nearly three hours going absolutely nowhere while serving up an idiotic and self-serving screenplay.  Everything in the service of diversity\\, social justice and feminism -- nothing in the service of a legitimate\\, worthy entry in Star Wars canon.","true":true}
