Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is such a great star wars movie and movie in general\\, it shows how the protagonist can change and it subverts expectations in a way that I still enjoyed. And yes\\, I am a Star Wars fan\\, just not the typical one that seems to hate the movies. It's a great movie with some flaws. I'm sure 10 years from now\\, star wars fans will cherish this movie like they are starting to with the prequels (that were in my opinion so much worse than they could've been).","true":true}
