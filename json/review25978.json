Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nothing to see here. There\u2019s no way people actually think there is an original story line here. Kylo\\, Rey and Snoke\u2019s scene is straight out of Return of the Jedi but with zero build up or pay off. Not one of these characters was built up so the audience can not care about anyone. And the one we already do care about? Oh don\u2019t worry. They tear Luke Skywalker off of his lofty Jedi pedestal and degrade him all the way back to being a whiny weak child again. Which is even more off putting in the body of one of the galaxy\u2019s most powerful Jedi Knights. TFA was *OK* the second time I watched it. Not original but at least promised potential character building in the next movie. This director made sure to destroy all hope. Will not be watching episode IX in theaters. ","true":true}
