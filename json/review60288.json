The reviewers claim they didn't like the story. But the story is one of the best stories in a video game\\, ever! The REASON people are giving it negative reviews\\, is because the story evokes feelings of hate\\, anger and sadness (amongst other like fear and excitement). It does so on a profound level.

But the story is one of the best stories in a video game\\, ever! The REASON people are giving it negative reviews\\, is because the story evokes feelings of hate\\, anger and sadness (amongst other like fear and excitement). It does so on a profound level. It's because of this reason that the game is so great! How often does a video game evoke such strong emotions? It's a testament to how good the game is. it's unfortunate that some reviewers have mistaken their feelings of hate\\, brought on by the story\\, to be an indication that the game itself is bad. But the game is fantastic and if you look at the reviews and see how polarized they are\\, with people absolutely loving it\\, or absolutely hating it\\, you can see there's something very interesting going on here. This game is worth playing regardless of how it makes you feel. It's worth playing because IT CAN MAKE YOU FEEL! The bottom line is it's a fantastic story with great gameplay\\, and it's a ton of fun and an emotional ride. I've been playing video games for 38 years. And this game just took fourth place\\, of all time.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
