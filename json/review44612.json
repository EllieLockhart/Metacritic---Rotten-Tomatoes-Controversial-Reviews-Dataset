Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Totally disappointed. Not what I was expecting. This might be the worst entry yet. The big reveal of Rey\u2019s parents was a big let down. Leia flying through space...ridiculous. Not letting Luke fight Kylo except thru a hologram...terrible. Luke dies from projecting himself through space??? At least Obi-won was actually struck down by Vader!!! Rey barely gets any actual Jedi training yet she can move rocks! Kylo kills his Master already?? Come on really? I was just disgusted. Mr. Lucas please comeback and fix this mess they have done with your baby!!!! \ud83d\ude10","true":true}
