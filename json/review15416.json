Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it and I don't really understand the many bad critics\\, besides the one about Luke Skywalker which I think too was a kind of a mess. Some bad reviews sound very political so I'm getting where they come from. So sad. But also funny :D","true":true}
