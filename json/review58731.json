As a sequel to one of the most loved games of all time\\, the story here is tremendously controversial. It takes you down paths that force you to question motivation and justice vs mercy along with the characters in the story. It's a beautifully written story created to make you feel torn. Nobody will finish this game with a smile on their face\\, even if you loved it the way my brother and I did. But I do assure you that the critics talking about plot holes and bad story decisions are wrong. They either don't get it\\, or fell into what naughty dog was trying to do to deeply. It's supposed to be hard. There are no happy endings in this post apocalyptic world.The gameplay was leagues ahead of it's predecessor. Rarely does combat feel so smooth. It often looks as if each move you make is scripted. Dodging and striking and running all happen exactly as you want them to\\, and the kills are always satisfying. My only real critique is not big enough to drop my score from 5 stars. The lootingnand exploration can be excessive. Skill and gear progression is based on exploration and looting. If you don't look in every corner you will miss out on abilities\\, weapons or upgrades. Overall it's a masterpiece.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
