Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lackluster film compared to the rest of the Star Wars films... \\nToo many plot flaws & drawn out scenes. The movie could have been condenced down to an 1hr & still told the same story. \\nIt really needed to stay in line with The Force Awakens & that is where I feel like they dropped the ball on this one. Felt let down walking out of the theater this time. \\n???????","true":true}
