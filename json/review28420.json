Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Predictable\\, shallow dialogue revolving around the same tired as conversations about \\\"hope\\\"\\, \\\"resistance\\\" and being a \\\"rebel\\\". The evil people are here\\, the good people are here\\, and yup\\, you guessed it\\, the rebels don't get defeated. The final scene with Luke fooling the bad Kilo dude was cool\\, but overall this was a shit movie that was clearly made to politically pander. Making it\\, what's the word? Oh yeah\\, propaganda.","true":true}
