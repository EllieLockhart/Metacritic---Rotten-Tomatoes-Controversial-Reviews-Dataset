Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some lovely eye candy and a handful of compelling moments slighted by cheap humor with inappropriate timing. That and a few blaring plot holes left me wanting more. After almost 3 hours\\, that shouldn\u2019t have been the case.","true":true}
