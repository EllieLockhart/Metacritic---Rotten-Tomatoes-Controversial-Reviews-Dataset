Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thoroughly enjoyed this Star Wars film.  Was it perfect? No.  But I do not believe it should be receiving the hate fans are currently giving it.  The acting was wonderful\\, the cinematography was stunning\\, and the story took turns that I did not expect and\\, the majority of the time\\, enjoyed.  The Force Awakens was criticized for being too much like Episode IV\\, but now people are criticizing this one because it's not \\\"Star Wars\\\" enough?  I don't understand.  Were there some slow scenes?  Yes\\, but there were slow scenes in the original trilogy.  Were there some strange creatures?  Yes\\, but that is a staple of Star Wars.  Were there twists?  Yes\\, but does \\\"No\\, I am your father\\\" ring a bell for anyone?  People have every right to like or dislike this film.  But to criticize it for \\\"ruining Star Wars\\\" is a bit much.  If you don't like where the story is going\\, then just watch the original trilogy.","true":true}
