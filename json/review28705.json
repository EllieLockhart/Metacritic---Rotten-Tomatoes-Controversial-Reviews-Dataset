Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pushed the Star Wars universe onto new and original grounds; while still remaining true to the original story and theme.  Filled with action\\, emotion\\, twists\\, and energy.  A must see\\, and a great addition to the new trilogy.","true":true}
