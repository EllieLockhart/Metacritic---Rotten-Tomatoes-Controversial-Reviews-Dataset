Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Enjoyed the IMAX experience watching this film but it wasn't as good as the Force Awakens. The ending was flat and anticlimactic. I didn't leave with the desire to see the next film. Also the film was far too long. I don't understand why they have to make these blockbuster films over two hours. There were several scenes that weren't necessary. This was easily the silliest of any star wars films. It was hard to take serious. Overall it's a good film but it was quite underwhelming.","true":true}
