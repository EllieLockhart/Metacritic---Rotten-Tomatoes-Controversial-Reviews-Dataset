Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"OK\\, my thoughts on the film:\\n\\nThe Good\\n-Seeing Luke\/Hamill once again\\n-Yoda's appearance\\n-Action scenes esp the very first one\\n-Holdo's sacrificial attack\\n\\nThe Bad\\n-Totally throws away the TFA storylines\\n-Princess Leia force flying\/breathing\\n-The whole side mission\\n\\nThe Ugly\\n-The moronic jokes incl Luke's lightsaber toss\\n-Chase scene that doesn't make much sense\\n-No emotional investment on the characters ala Rogue One\\n\\nThis movie is entertaining but shallow.  It throws away all the positive hype built by JJ Abrams in TFA.  It lacks purpose\\, emotion and character ala Rogue One.","true":true}
