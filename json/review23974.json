Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Many are trying to say only a few fans are tanking this film.  Well\\, as I write this\\, 177\\,469 others have left a review.  What does that mean?  THIS MOVIE SUCKED!!!  Honestly\\, why are people still defending this?  The \\\"leaders\\\" of the Star Wars Nazi party are all screeching snowflake millennials\\, yelling and having temper tantrums?  And THIS is supposed to be the replacement for the Empire and Darth Vader?!?  All you need to beat the First Order is a stern adult.  This was an insult to the saga George Lucas created.","true":true}
