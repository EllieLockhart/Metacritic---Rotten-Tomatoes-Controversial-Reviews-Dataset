{"101487":191161,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-04","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Updating my review to 1 star. I see people commenting that a 1\/2 star or a review of \\\" not interested \\\" is not accepted \/ included into the RT score system.\\n\\nIf you posted a review of 1\/2 star or \\\" Not interested \\\" In hopes of adding to the %  score\\, you might want to revise it to minimum 1 star. ( not that it deserves it) But it is still negative\\, and at least  your vote...I think??...Will be accumulated into the totals.\\n\\nSomething I have noticed\\, if you look outside the USA\\, for official critic reviews\\, only in the USA do you find an overwhelming favorable review. Latin America\\, Canada\\, Europe 90% of the critic reviews are similar to what you see from most non proffesional critics here in Rt\\, Metacritic and youtube\\,  The review is 90%  negative. Why will one country\\, and its critics have one point of view\\, but the rest of the world is negative.\\n\\nI am not one for conspiracy theorys\\, but something smells very bad with that.  If in fact the critics were somehow induced to write favorable reviews\\, that brings to mind a whole new level of deciet I did not think was possible as a whole.\\n\\nDisney\\, and Kathleen Kennedy\\, and idiot Ryan J\\, are making comments that it is only a small % of  fans that did not like the movie\\, and this can be overlooked as it is not important. \\n\\n\\\" butt hurt fans\\, that did not get their way\\\"\\n\\nOr racists\\, women haters and retards......\\n\\nYup okay....\\n\\nIt is not only \\\" fanboys \/ girls\\\" as people call us\\, that did not like the movie\\, it is men\\, women\\, teens\\, people of all ethnicitys.Doctors\\, lawyers\\, professionals.... educated inteligent people\\, blue colar. So I find it almost funny that Kathleen K and  Ryan J...give the impression anyone not liking this movie is a racist\\, a sexist pig\\, or a retard.\\n\\nWay beyond insulting\\n\\n\\nAnyway... my review...\\n\\nBy the way  you 5 star review people\\, saying \\\" Best movie ever ! \\\" or similar....How can you give this movie top marks with all the errors and the destruction of all the previous movies that are in this film ? You must be seeing a different movie than the rest of us\\, because honestly\\, I do not understand how any one can give it more than maybe 2 stars for visuals and music.\\n\\nWhat did you see that made you feel it earns 5 stars? take the time to write out what you found to be entertaining.\\n\\nThis is a horrible movie\\, terrible writting\\, total disregard for past movie lore\\, and the basic history of Star Wars.\\n\\nAnyway The last jedi.\\nIt is shit pure and simple\\, with horrid writting and full of nonsensical plots and errors.\\n\\nSome glaring things\/ errors I found that insulted my inteligence or tossed out old star wars lore.\\n\\n1) C3P0... from TFA to TLJ the timeline is only a few days\\, maybe a week from the destruction of the First order star killer base. The resistance \/ rebelion is under sige... but in all this chaos someone decided to find C3P0 a new matching arm ? ( arm was red in TFA ) This was more important than...I dont know....? suriving the battles with the first order ? \\\" Oh my god were going to die ! But...wait ! C3P0 !....I know your left arm is ok\\, and it functions... but I cant stand the color....go down to maintence and get a new one to match your other arm! \\\" Is this what has happened amidst all the chaos ??\\n\\nThis is what constitutes good writing ? Lack of attention to details\\, and poor story continuation. This is part 8 yes? It is a continuation of part 7....yes?\\,  Glaring errors.\\n\\n*** How can anyone say this is a 5 star movie ? How can many of the official  critics not see any of these errors ? Is it not important? \\n\\n2) As has been noted\\, the humor was stupid\\, Hux and Poe the telephone call was idiotic\\, and after that you could not take any of the first order officers as serious characters. Humor in bad moments\\, when the flight deck is destroyed\\, and all the resistance pilots are killed... save for Poe... Instead of having a moment of grief for the audience.. BB8 bounces in with the stupid beeping \\\" Dont worry kids ! I am okay !\\, See I am alive....everyone else is dead BUT!!! Me\\, the cute robot !\\, I lived ! Dont feel bad for the other people.... I am still here ! \\\"  This was so stupid.  In rogue one\\, and looking back on A new Hope...when pilots \/ people were killed\\, the audience could feel something for the lost characters.... but in this trash its like all these people were in the way and good ridance...But wow ! Thank god the annoying droid is alive... I was really worrioed..... \\n\\nShit writing\\, shit humor.\\n\\n\\n3) The timeline for TLJ is only a few days from when the resistance destroyed the first order star killer base from TFA..... in that time the resistance has become a shadow of its former self\\, no support\\, no money\\, no people\\, no ships....nada. They have been fighting for 40 years\\, saved the galaxy from Darth Vader\\, the Emperor\\, they destroyed 2 death stars and the first order planet killer ....and have no support from the galaxy of people they have been saving \\\" oh yeah\\, thanks for keeping my planet from being blown up... money ? ...support?? ... yeah...well you know times are tough..sorry cant help you... \\\" At the end of the movie...the resistance now..less 400 people\\, no ships\\, no nada...and to hide behind a big metal door the great plan was to send out a message begging for help....seriously ?! If no one wanted to help the resistance at its best\\, no one would be coming when they are at their worst.\\n\\nJust 100% shit writing\\, lazy writing.\\n\\n4) Rose and Fin. Underdevoped characters brought in ..it seems for idiotic comic relief. Casino planet was a complete waste of time.  Chewie. R2D2\\, C3Po\\, Admiral Akbar...wow...iconic characters with almost no screen time. \\n\\n5) The force now....teaches you everthing you need to know ! Training ??! Who the fuck needs training ?! Not Rey ! She knows everything\\, including how to best a jedi master ! And certainly not the kid at the end of the movie\\, moving his broom in ways that took Aniken years to master ! Is this the message we want to send out ?  \\\" You dont need school or training or experience.... you should know everything all on your own\\\" WTF do we all spend money to go to university for ?  No start at the bottom and work your way to the top\\, you should be entitled to be president of a company the moment you apply for a job..... For fuck sake\\n\\nAnyway...\\n\\nLazy shit writing\\, that in mere  moments destroys all the old lore for the past movies. And why? For what reason? \\n\\n6) Luke...the man that can find good in Darth Vader\\, spare his life... now at a moment of weakness....is going to kill his nephew....... his sisters and his best friends son...Because !!! He has dark thoughts...?! Seriously ?! WTF .....Did the idiot writer not read a book\\, or see any of the previous movies ? What ?! This is good writing ? This is good character developement ? This is ...new and fresh\\, captivating ? This exciting changes to the characters ?! And Lukes map ?...okay...why did he leave a map if he had no desire to be found?? ! It is beyond stupid. \\n\\nThe message ..... seems to be \\\" If you fail\\, go run away and hide\\, abandon everything  and everybody and go live in shame untill you die. \\n\\nNice...\\n\\n\\n***You people giving 5 stars....did you not notice any of this ? Or you just could not give a shit ??*** \\n\\n\\n7) Leia..okay...wow\\, just wow........never using the force for anything\\, cant use the force to find Luke....But in one moment when she is sucked into the vacume of space\\, she can become the most powerful jedi or sith that has ever lived before or since?!  Wow... more shit writing\\, just for have a extra movie subplot? Or what?\\n\\n\\n8) Reys parentage... ok we had to wait 2 years for the big back story of \\\" sorry your parents were dead beat drunks \\\" Ok and fine\\, but this could have been built up much different.\\n\\nLazy writing\\n\\n9) Snoke.... dont know where he came from\\, how he took over power\\, who trained him...nada. There is no mention of his name in any of the previous movies\\, books\\, cartoons nothing. A character with no backstory\\, killed off.\\n\\n10\\, The big space chase. The first order... they are so stupid...as to not send ships out in front to blockade the resistance ? It was impossible to think of the first order with any degree of seriousness\\n\\n11) Yoda\\, now is almost a god. He can command lighting to destroy things. Where the fuck was he\\, if he was so powerful to give Luke some tutoring when he was teaching his students?' Where was Obi Wan ? They let him fuck up with his students\\, and basicaly from that mistake the first order rises up.... and ..they leave Luke to be depressed for his depression on the island...? But ! Yoda decides to come out of ...hiding ? And tell Luke the old jedi books are no longer important\\, and uses the force to burn the old books ? Seriously ?\\n\\nThis is good writing? this is entertaining ? Again you 5 star review people...did none of this make you think \\\" WTF ?\\\"\\n\\n12) The Knights of Ren are....where ? Anyone know ?\\n\\nMaybe the 5 star review people know? I know I dont have a clue\\, but for many people this did not seem important. \\n\\n13) Kylo Ren and Fin\\, at the end of TFA are both very injured\\, now\\, a few days later in TLJ... they are ok ? Kylo was cut down hard\\, and Fin was almost dead...? \\n\\n( 5 star review people\\, care to comment on this ?? ) \\n\\n14) Sub plots with no point\\, misplaced humor\\, no character development or very poor use of characters and actors. Captain Phasma..and Benicio Del Toro...what a waste.\\n\\n15) Social messages...... we need this in a star wars movie ? Men are evil\\, or stupid or both. Rich people are all bad and cant be trusted...? This last part I find almost funny\\, coming from people like Kathleen Kennedy and the Disney executives...These people make more money in 1 week than most people will see in 5 lifetimes... but\\, obviosly they do not consider themselves as rich \/ wealthy ....?\\n\\n16) Why did a droid not pilot the ship in its suicide run ? Or...autopilot ? Droids have more value than a living being ? Or ...was purple hair commander not able to think about this ? We needed one more heroic death ?\\n\\n17) Admiral Akbar....after 40 + years service to the rebelion...his character is quite literal tossed out the window.... not even a \\\" Thanks much ! \\\" Again\\, what a horrible send off to a loved character.\\n\\nThe story\\, the writting\\, the plot\\, seriously\\, think about it...it is horrible. How anyone can see this movie...even as a stand alone movie...not as a star wars movie\\, and give it a 5 star review blows my mind.\\n\\n\\\" Let the past die...kill it if you must \\\" \\nYup ! Similar to Akbar...I think this is what Disney intentions are for the 40 years of fans of the movies . \\\" We dont need or want you any more...fuck off ! \\\"\\n\\n\\nI can go one and on\\, and on\\, as to why this movie is so terrible\\, just as so many other people have. it is a shit movie\\, on its own it is a shit movie\\, as a star wars movie it is a disgrace.\\n\\nHonestly...I think Disney and Kathleen Kennedy must think . \\n\\\" All the star wars fans are stupid\\, and they will buy into anything we want and will not notice any changes. They are to stupid to know or care what we do with the movies\\, they will go and pay the money and not care because !! Its Star wars !\\\"\\n\\nI give 1 star for good visuals and music\\, but the rest of the movie is trash.\\n\\nEnd quote.\\n\\nI give 1 star for visuals and music.... but honestly this should be a given for a Star Wars movie...","true":true}
