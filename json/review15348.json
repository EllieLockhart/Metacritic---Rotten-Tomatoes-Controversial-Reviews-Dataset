Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'll say this was over all a ok movie but it was a terrible Star Wars movie. It did nothing to further a develop the characters in the new canon. Over all the plot to the movie was rea half baked and the director didn't use the fantastic actors he had to their full potential. The story didn't mesh at all with the set story. Again a terrible Star Wars movie.","true":true}
