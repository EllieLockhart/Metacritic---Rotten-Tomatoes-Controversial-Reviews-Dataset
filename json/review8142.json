Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic movie\\, all these people commenting saying this was worse than watching jar jar\\, all need to rethink and rewatch the movie because it definitely was better than that. Also stop being so harsh just because it\u2019s Star Wars. The movie was great. ","true":true}
