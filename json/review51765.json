Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A dumpster fire.\\n\\nSurely Rian Johnson was consciously trolling the audience. He says in interviews that he is a longtime Star Wars fan and yet no fan would write anything to compare with this steaming pile.
