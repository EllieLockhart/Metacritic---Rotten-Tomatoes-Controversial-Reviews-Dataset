Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was a great film! It went in an unexpected direction which I found to be far more interesting and refreshing! Mark Hamill was outstanding\\, probably his finest performance! The film was definitely darker\\, but maintained a sense of urgency! This film is the middle in a trilogy and it fulfills its role nicely by advancing the franchise and setting up a finale that will be epic! I would recommend ignoring all these negative audience reviews and enjoy this film. ","true":true}
