Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was okay\\, but definitely didn't pack the same type of renewed wonder and excitement that the previous entry provided.  The story felt slat\\, uninspired and a bit of a let down in how it dealt with the return of Luke Skywalker.  There were certainly some interesting twist. but the plot left me with more questions than answers.  The hardcore Star Wars fans will undoubtedly still go out and see it\\, but I think the casual fan would be better off waiting for the dvd.","true":true}
