Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have loved Star Wars my whole life and I am 38. This movie is by far the worst. All it needed was jar jar bins. The characters acted so out of character it was ridiculous. And what was with the cheesy jokes. Yoda didn't even have a wise and serious moment. I am disappointed in every character and the direction or ending they took. I did not gain any worthwhile story from it either. This one should have do over!!","true":true}
