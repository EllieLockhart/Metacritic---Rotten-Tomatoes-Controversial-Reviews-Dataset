Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A soulless and pointless film overflowing with digital diarrhea.  The makers of this monstrosity have no love for the Star Wars universe nor do they care how much damage they do to the lore or our beloved characters.  This is not the Luke Skywalker i grew up with and this is not the Star Wars i know.  Just awful.","true":true}
