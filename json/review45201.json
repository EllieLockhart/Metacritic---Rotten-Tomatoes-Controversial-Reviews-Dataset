Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(UNLIMITED SPOILERS!!!!)\\n\\nHello there. \\n\\nI don't like The Last Jedi. It's cold\\, it's crude\\, and irritating with lame jokes everywhere. Oh\\, and have you ever heard the Tragedy of Darth Snoke the Wise? I thought not\\, it's not a backstory The Last Jedi would tell you. He was so strong in the dark side of the Force\\, that he had the power to be a mysterious and interesting character. Unfortunately\\, his apprentice killed him in a way that seemed unnatural.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi was the Chosen One. It was promised to uplift the Sequel Trilogy\\, not leave it in darkness. Instead the series died with critics' thunderous applause\\, which was a surprise to be sure\\, and an unwelcome one. \\n\\nBut from my point of view\\, The Last Jedi is evil. It took all our childhood heroes and killed them. It killed them all. They're dead\\, every single one of them. And not just Han Solo\\, but Luke and Leia.\\n\\nTherefore\\, let us execute audience score 53 and tell Disney that they don't want to sell us merchandise. \\n\\nI'll go home and rethink my life now.","true":true}
