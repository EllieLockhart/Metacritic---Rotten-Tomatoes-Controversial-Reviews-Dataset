Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film made me angry.  So many storylines built up in The Force awakens just fizzled out for no reason.  Luke wouldn't act like he did and his death  was idiotic.  The cringing casino part could've been avoided if the vice admiral had said what her plan was from the beginning.  Snoke and Phasma were pointless characters in the end.  Yep\\, left me angry..","true":true}
