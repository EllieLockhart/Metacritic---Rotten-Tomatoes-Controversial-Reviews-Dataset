Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Felt more like a marvel movie with star wars characters than a real star wars movie. Still enjoyed it but no where as good as Empire Strikes Back or even Rogue One. Some story elements from force awakens seemed dropped or skipped over or that original plans were scrapped from JJ to Rian. Curious how Rey's parents and smoke background play out with JJ back for 9???   Am interested to see what Rian can do with his own story away from the whiney ass Skywalker's.","true":true}
