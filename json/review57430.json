Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was atrocious. I challenge anyone who thought this was a good movie to explain what made it so. \\n\\nIf we remove this movie from the broader SW universe and judge it solely on its own merits\\, it doesn't hold water. Take the main plot point\\, a Mon Calamari cruiser and two support vessels can't be destroyed by 2 star destroyers and Snokes ship simply because they have their backs turned? What is this nonsense? It's even internally inconsistent because two TIE photon torpedoes almost destroy the Mon Calamari cruiser right at the beginning.\\n\\nNext is the asinine adventure to the casino. What was the point of this little hour long excursion? It literally added nothing to the plot--AT ALL. They could have found myriad other ways to put Finn on Snoke's ship or they could have not put him on Snoke's ship at all. It would not have made a difference to the story.\\n\\nAlso\\, how did Rey get off Snoke's ship? I don't know if I fell asleep during this part or what\\, but I honestly cannot recall. One minute Snoke's ship is being rammed and the next we see Rey on the Millennium Falcon. WTH?\\n\\nThis just highlights some of the internal problems with this movie. I'm not going to start on why this movie doesn't work in the broader SW universe or as a sequel to TFA.\\n\\nSo disappointed.","true":true}
