Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"great visuals and flashy special effects that are designed to distract you from the sheer weakness of the plot. The plot is all over the place\\, the characters are weak (Rey is a Mary Sue like many have said) and Rose's character is completely unnecessary. No emotional depth whatsoever and the way they disrespected Luke's character is unforgivable. Luke acted completely out of character-in The Force Awakens\\, he hides a map in R2D2 of where he is hiding and then in this movie he just wants to be left alone? I understand that he may be bitter and blames himself for what happened in the past but no spoilers; how could they treat his character like that? Luke Skywalker's entire character feels cheapened and for nought by this film. I think it was cool that Rian wanted to introduce new elements into the universe\\, but it gets to a point where it is TOO MUCH. So much unnecessary and cheesy parts of the film. Where is the magic of Star Wars? According to Disney\\, money over quality. So disappointed by this film I am in shock.","true":true}
