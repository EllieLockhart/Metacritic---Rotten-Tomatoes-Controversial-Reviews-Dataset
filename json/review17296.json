{"101487":139337,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-06","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to like this movie\\, but it just had so so many flaws. The actors themselves weren't awful\\, and the performances by Adam Driver\\, Daisy Ridley and Oscar Issac were particularly well done. The writing and direction for this film are so badly executed that you'll find yourself scratching your head while watching more than you will be immersed in the typical magic you get from Star Wars films. \\nFirst of all\\, pretty much all of the movie is a chase scene. If I had known this\\, I probably wouldn't have even bothered to watch. The pace of the film is rather confusing\\, as the film constantly shifts from CATASTROPHIC DANGER to poorly executed humorous calm scenes. The humor hit occasionally\\, but much of the time it felt poorly timed. \\nI think my biggest peeve about this film is that I was expecting that perhaps some of the upper level rebel leadership were double agents\\, but it turns out they're simply incompetent. I thought that perhaps the code breaker was only pretending to be on the Empires side\\, possibly making for a nice twist\\, but again I was dissapointed. I thought that perhaps the purple haired SJW was the turncoat\\, because she refused to tell anyone what her plan was. Yep\\, she wasn't\\, she was just a very very bad leader. This film had a lot of potential to be cool if the writer wasn't so lazy. \\nRey: Her character had a lot of development and growth in this film\\, and her role was executed particularly well. She is the best part of the film\\, especially for fans who will see a great deal of 'Return of the Jedi' Luke in her. If it wasn't for her\\, I think this film would be one of the worst I've ever seen.\\nKylo Ren: The first half of the film I was really pleased with his character. His character felt sincere\\, and the acting was superb. He kind of ruins his own character arc in the last half of the film\\, but he is still far from the worst that this film brings to the screen.\\nLuke: We all kind of hoped that when Rey found her he would step up for her the same way Yoda did for him\\, but he just didn't. He was hesitant to train someone again after Kylo Ren\\, but I really wish they didn't make 70% of the movie Luke REFUSING to train her. All-in-all\\, another failure on the writers part.\\nPoe: His character is enjoyable to watch\\, if only he wasn't shut down by every female in the Rebellion\\, despite his continued sucess as a leader.\\nFinn: I felt that his character stayed true to what we expected of him from the last film\\, but the plot sent him on a long convoluted and rather pointless journey instead of letting him contribute to the film like he should have.\\nRose: Why. Why does she even appear in this film. It would be one thing if she was a forgettable background character\\, but her character does more to hurt the film and plot than it helps. So much of what she brings to the film is unpleasant to watch. I don't think it was the actresses fault though\\, her character was just less helpful and less entertaining than Jar Jar Binks.\\nThis movie is a sad attempt at a star wars film. It makes the prequels seem pretty good in comparison. The weird mashup of side quests and irritating characters ends up being one confusing mess. I'd say save your money and wait for it to come out on Netflix\\, but if you really want to see it\\, wait for it to be a bit cheaper in theaters. It's an OKAY film at best\\, but for it to be a 'Star Wars' film\\, it's really pathetic.","true":true}
