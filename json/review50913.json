Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute crap. I don't even need to argue with fans who think everyone is mad because it's \\\"not like every other Star Wars movie\\\" no\\, it's not. It lacks things like character development and plot. Such a shit turn to a new beginning that showed so much promise.","true":true}
