Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was excited to see it\\, however quickly after the opening scroll and first sequence I found myself bored and never fully recovered. On top of not being very exciting\\, it creates stupid  dialogue  and moments  that make you question why they were even put in the movie. During the movie I felt like those have felt when they went to see The Phantom Menace and were confused; however\\, George Lucas cannot be blamed for this (thankfully). There is some good action sequences\\, plot twists\\, and interesting development of the force. However\\, they try too much to make it a kids movie by letting certain characters live after certain death\\, stupid romantic development\\, and the strange sexual tension between Rey and Kylo. Minor spoilers that don't really account for much; I don't understand how they're outrunning the First Order \\\"while low on gas\\\" and the First Order can't even send bombers\\, quick jump through hyperspace to catch them\\, or anything like that which would end the movie and Resistance in 5 minutes. If you want to learn anything about Snoke; you won't.... If you're hoping for an exciting reunion with Luke\\, don't. He has good parts\\, and is the best part of the whole movie\\, however the script they provided for him along with his fate is truly confusing and frustrating for fans. In reality this is a pretty forgettable movie.. sad to hear that there's already another trilogy planned. Giving 2 stars as a round up\\, and for things I liked about it\\, but I couldn't fully get over everything that went terribly wrong with the movie.","true":true}
