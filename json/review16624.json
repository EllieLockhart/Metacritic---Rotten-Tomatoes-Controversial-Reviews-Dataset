Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Incredible! The Last Jedi pays homage to its predecessors while preparing us for something new to come. There are so many parallels and possible clues from the past connecting it to the next generation - it really is a plot 40 years in the making. The new worlds were stunning\\, the new animals were adorable\\, and the new twist on a familiar tale was gripping to watch. Go see it if you haven't already!","true":true}
