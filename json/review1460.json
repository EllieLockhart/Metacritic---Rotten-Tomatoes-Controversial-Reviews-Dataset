Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a fan since childhood\\, the first Star Wars i saw was the release of Empire Strikes Back around 1997\\, I then grew up watching 1 2 ad 3\\, which I genuinely liked\\, only being a child of around 10 for Phantom menace. I have always enjoyed the movies even 7 and Rogue One were great\\, this is the first time I'm actually quite disappointed in a Star Wars film\\, and thats saying a lot. \\n\\nFrom the weird Mary Poppins\\, to the pointless side plots and rushed character development of Rey\\, it all had so much potential but felt underwhelming. I hope 9 makes up for this or somebody remakes 8.","true":true}
