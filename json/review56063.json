Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many holes in the plot line\\, I don't know where to begin. The entire movie felt rushed. There was no substance to many of the scenes. Rey has no training but can hold her own against Kylo (Who has been trained by Luke and Snoke his entire life). Luke was just running from Rey all over that fucking mountain. \\n\\nStar wars is known for its cheesy lines and moments\\, but some of the lines in this movie simply poor writing.\\n\\nTotally rushed through the Casino scenes\\, might as well just cut the whole part out.\\n\\nKelly Marie Tran's character... yea\\, didn't give two shits about her.\\n\\nFN is a janitor defector but can beat Phasma in a fight... and Kylo with a saber? TF\\n\\nWhen did Leia become a master of the force? Surviving an explosion\\, the vacuum of space\\, and just flew back in like Marry Poppins? Really?!\\n\\nUsing the ship running out of fuel for the driving force of the movie... Why?\\n\\\"They can track us through light speed now\\\". Fire who ever came up with that.\\n\\nDisneys unlimited budget and this is the shit they come out with. SMH","true":true}
