Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm an enormous Star Wars fan and have been my entire life. I had opening night tickets with my Dad who saw the original Star Wars in theaters. I had reserved the perfect seats. This ended up being the only Star Wars film I haven't rewatched. It ruined just about everything: The power and legacy of Luke Skywalker who tried to kill his student in his sleep\\, threw away his old lightsaber for a laugh\\, brushed his shoulders off for a laugh\\, and had just enough force power to project himself? This movie destroyed the power and legacy of Leia\\, who is now more of a nice Grandma type then a force imbued leader of the rebellion. It destroyed the lightsaber\\, literally. It destroyed just about everything to be honest. That said\\, I enjoyed the salt scene up until the point where Luke brushes off his shoulder\\, and despite all of the mistakes in the throne room scene (disappearing weapon\\, Smith acolyte throwing his weapon to the side so he can die\\, etc.) I found it fun to watch. Overall\\, I found the movie visually striking\\, and tried to take that into account when rating this movie. I think if it was a stand-alone it would deserve about 4 stars because of the acting and cinematography but would fall short on the script. But as a member of the Skywalker Saga\\, it deserved 0 stars. So 2 stars it is.","true":true}
