Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Beautifully shot movie. Didn't feel like a Star Wars Movie but perhaps that's the point.   I may not agree on all the decision Rian Johnson made but I understand them.  I grew up on Star Wars and if the franchise is going to continue it needs to evolve.  We are seeing that evolution.","true":true}
