Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing film full of unnecessary and distractingly bad ideas. \\nIgnoring that this film felt a b-grade scifi flick rather then the franchise goliath Star wars. The pacing felt way off and left no real room to breathe in some parts\\, the humour so cringe-inducing and common I felt like I was watching a youtube parody\\, writing so odd and dispassionately uninspiring and some of the acting from new characters and extras falling flat. All this felt incredibly distractingly bad and hard to take seriously for me. The story and decisions made for characters\\, settings and mythology I thought went completely against what came before\\, leaving it inconsistent with the other films. In terms of a Star Wars chapter\\, the film felt pointless\\,no real tension and stakes\\, which really subdues my excitement for the next film. The unforgivable treatment of some long term characters left a bad taste with me and dont get me started on the plot holes kept appearing not to mention some real \\\"wtf\\\" moments that popped up. I hate to say it but there was also some element of catering to social issues\\, which would of been fine if more subtle and less distracting. I will say the visuals\\, shots\\, music and some action scenes were great but not enough to redeem. Overall It wasn't a good experience for me\\, being completely distracted by my stated issues more then suspending my disbelief\\, which was even more painful considering this was a Star wars film.","true":true}
