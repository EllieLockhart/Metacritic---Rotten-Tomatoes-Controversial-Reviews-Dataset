Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it\\, but I can see why a lot of Star Wars fans are salty about it(because they really just wanted remakes of the previous films). The cinematography was excellent. The humor was a little unnecessary\\, but didn't really detract from the film. The writing for Luke's character is one of my two main criticisms\\, but Mark Hamill does an excellent job with what he's given. Adam Driver was phenomenal\\, but I wouldn't say any major character had bad acting; all were good.\\n\\nOverall\\, it was nice to see Star Wars return to what it's supposed to be about\\, and not continue with the prequel's bullcrap. Eliminate the one unnecessary subplot of the film\\, and it's a 10\/10. Even with the unnecessary subplot\\, it's still phenomenal.","true":true}
