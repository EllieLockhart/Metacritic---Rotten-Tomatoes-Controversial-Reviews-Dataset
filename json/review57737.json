Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very Disappointed. From the major flaw of the plot\\, the bringing in of new\\, unimportant characters\\, the killing off of established characters and overall lack of explanation of anything makes me feel cheated that I waited so long to see the downfall of the Skywalker  Saga since the company doesn\\nt seem interested in maintaining that the Skywalkers ever really matter. I want to see The Force when I go to a Star Wars film.\\n\\nSPOILER:\\n\\nAs has been said by other posters\\, if you missed this film\\,other than the death of Luke if you didn't see this film then going from episode 7 to 9 you wouldn't really be lost.\\nAlso a major plot hole is that as the First Order bears down on the Resistance Escape Pods and Vice-Admiral Hodo decides to hyperspace jump and kill Snokes starship\\, one has to question why this wasn't the very first thing that the Resistance tried when they discovered that the First order could track them through space? If the Resistance had just abandoned the 2 vessels that were eventually destroyed anyway and do that at the beginning of the chase? wouldn't that have stopped the whole problem.\\n\\nAlso\\, although partially covered in some of the novels the whole explanation as to why the Resistance is so small and there is no real Republic force that they can call is also troubling. Mon Mothma had begun de-militarizing and decentralizing the military leading up tothe battle of Jakku\\, but there was still a Republic Navy\\, and the Battle of Jakku was 30 years before this film. If the First Order had so much time to build up\\, why didn't the Republic have some ships as well?\\n\\nLuke's meaningless death at the end has been touched on many times\\, but it is still soooo disappointing and so frustrating that the producers\/ writers feel such a need to cut out the old characters in what I can only think is because they don't want to have to ask the actors to continue to come back or deal with fans asking what the original characters will do when they make a new film. It doesn't ever seem like established Jedi\/ Force users can ever win. And to spend so much time earlier in the film with Yoda specifically pointing out the Luke needed to pass on what he had learned and that failure was the best teacher only to have Luke die an hour later is just ridiculous. So many scenes in the movie seemed to be completely disregarded and ignored as the  movie progressed. \\n\\nI will always like Star Wars\\, but I get more satisfaction from the animated TV series than I have from any of the new movies. Again\\, I want to see the Force when I watch Star Wars. If they wanted to just do a Space Western\\, you don't need the Star Wars brand to do that.","true":true}
