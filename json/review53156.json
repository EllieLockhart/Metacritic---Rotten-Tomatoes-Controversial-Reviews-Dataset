Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Back and forth on this. The special effects were great and the plot was there. But for the first time in Star Wars I was just...bored. Subverting expectations does not make a film original. If you are going to do it\\, make it fantastic\\, exciting\\, mystical...all the things every Star Wars before (even the prequels and Force Awakens) was. At the end of the day\\, what makes this movie \\\"cool?\\\" What was \\\"amazing?\\\" what was \\\"incredible?\\\" Unfortunately\\, the answer is always \\\"nothing.\\\"","true":true}
