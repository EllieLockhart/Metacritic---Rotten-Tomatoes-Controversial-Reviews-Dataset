Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"utterly disrespectful to fans\\, and to star wars in general. fuck you for what you have done you uncreative\\, cowardly human beings that have the tenacity to put your names on george lucas' creation\\, and then take a shit on it.","true":true}
