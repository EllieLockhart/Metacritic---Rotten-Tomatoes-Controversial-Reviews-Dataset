Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have seen this movie 4 times. I have really tried to enjoy and like it\\, but it is just not happening. Force Awakens= New Hope\\, Last Jedi =Empire Strikes Back. I wonder what the next Star Wars movie will equal. Boring\\, lame and totally dumbed down. Star Wars is supposed to be PG13\\, come one Disney . Take the tone of Tron","true":true}
