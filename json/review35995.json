{"101487":175629,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi pulls you in\\, then turns around and pushes you away. In what boils down to a movie that seems to have no heart\\, and is certainly made by a committee\\, as it tries to hit all the right notes\\, to please everyone\\, and get the biggest return it can.\\n\\nWith that sentence out of the way\\, on first viewing\\, as the credits rolled\\, I sat in contemplation.\\n\\n\\\"Did I enjoy it?\\\" I asked myself. \\\"Yes... I think...\\\"\\n\\nBut after sitting down to process what I'd seen\\, I felt really let down. So here's some of the things I hated most.\\n\\nRey is a nobody? Which means everyone can be somebody\\, is a cute notion to tell your children in real life\\, but not in Star Wars. I hope this is corrected in episode IX\\, sometimes we need heroes that are from something in a story about a family that's meant so much to so many people.\\n\\nSnoke being nothing but a red herring was such an incredible let down\\, that to me there's no real villain in this trilogy anymore. Kylo-Ren? Really?\\n\\nPeople rave about Adam Drivers acting chops\\, but that doesn't turn him into an epic villain in this film for me. He feels extremely empty\\, unhinged\\, boiling over with hatred\\, but without striking the fear that a character like Darth Vader did before him. He's like a child throwing a temper tantrum\\, and does nothing to bring me to the edge of my seat. Snoke wasn't an incredible character\\, but at least there was mystery surrounding him that left it open to greatness. With Ben\\, as much as I loved him in The Force Awakens as a broken person\\, that doesn't lead itself well to being the main villain.\\n\\nWhere the original movies had funny moments and dialogue\\, the humour here seems ill timed and forced\\, leading to awkward moments.\\n\\nFin and Rose go wandering the gambling planet feels like it was forced into the movie at the expense of many other great possibilities that people would rather see. I appreciate some new characters\\, but not at the expense of the most important ones.\\n\\nAnd finally after everything we've been through with Luke\\, he's thrown away to make room for the next generation. His epic sacrifice seems half hearted and empty. Even if the choice was always going to be to kill Luke in this movie\\, I could probably have taken an hour and come up with a handful of better ways to do it.\\n\\nLet's take note that I loved The Force Awakens despite its flaws. So my thoughts aren't about a new movie being different\\, it's about something that feels forced\\, as it walks over the characters and story we love. The Last Jedi as a part of the canon is pretty awful\\, but as a stand alone is an entertaining film. I was almost never bored\\, but I was certainly disheartened later.\\n\\nWhen Disney purchased Lucasfilm and went about removing the incredible novels that had been done by Timothy Zahn from the Star Wars canon\\, they had giant shoes to fill. \\\"Heir to the Empire\/Thrawn\\\" was an incredible trilogy of books that I was worried would be forgotten\\, or make these new movies underwhelming.\\n\\nThe Force Awakens made me forget those books\\, The Last Jedi made me remember them. And though the number of people who have read them is incredibly small compared to those that have watched these new films\\, if Episode IX doen't deliver I can see a world in which a small group of rebels rely on an awkward mix of movies and books to make up their own Star Wars Canon.\\n\\nRebel Machette Watching Order\\n\\nA New Hope (Harmy Despecialized)\\nEmpire Strikes Back (Harmy Despecialized)\\nAttack of the Clones\\nRevenge of the Sith \\nReturn of the Jedi (Harmy Despecialized)\\nHeir to the Empire\\nDark Force Rising\\nThe Last Command\\n\\nCould JJ Abrams save this trilogy? It's possible\\, but he has a mess of galactic proportions to to clean up. Am I throwing these new movies away in a tirade? Not yet. But I reserve the right to do so. Hell\\, I'm even going to see The Force Awakens again in theatre.\\n\\nMay The Force Be With You","true":true}
