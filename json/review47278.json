Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a stinker. Beautiful sets\\, good acting\\, amazing special effects\\, and a clunker of a story with plot chasims you could fly a star-destroyer through.  The script seems to deliberately set out to destroy everything fans love about the Star Wars universe & seems to be more about the writers ego than trying to produce entertainment..  Really disappointing.","true":true}
