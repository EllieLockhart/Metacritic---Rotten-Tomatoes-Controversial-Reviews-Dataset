Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To be honest this is a pretty good Star Wars movie. I obviously don\u2019t think it\u2019s better than force awakens but it\u2019s a strong sequel that I enjoyed a lot. It felt like the final movie in the trilogy and that\u2019s saying a lot. A strong solid entry in this new sequel trilogy in the Star Wars saga. Luke Skywalker had the best performance in the whole movie and Rey had the worst as there\u2019s so many things that happen that made me not care about Rey anymore. Overall I won\u2019t spoil the rest just go and watch it. You\u2019ll have a fun time watching this movie.","true":true}
