Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They introduce a very cool idea for a plot\\, then just ignore it for the whole movie. Instead of copying one of the episodes 3-6\\, they just take random bits of each and string together a sequence of \\\"consequence\\\" that is in no way related to the main plot point they establish. It is filled to the brim with Deus ex machina\\, which makes the entire thing boring. They waste good characters in boring and useless roles. It feels like the creators were in a capitalist frenzy and craved a new starwars movie to sell products.","true":true}
