Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars was created to be space adventure full of archetypes of good and evil with melodramatic twists. This film's naval-gazing and smug subversion of everything set up in the previous film is both boring and insulting. The illogical behaviour of the characters and the failure of the internal logic of the story's universe make this a deeply frustrating and disappointing watch after the fun of episode VII.","true":true}
