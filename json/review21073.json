Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was shocked at how badly this movie was executed.  The plot was full of holes\\, three scenes are copied directly from the Empire Strikes Back\\, one from Return of the Jedi.  The actors are good looking but lack any development or warmth.  Rey (the heroine) does basically zero training and is some master of the force\\, which defeats the whole Hero's Journey side of the films (a theme in tons of movies and a tale as old as time).  Luke makes decisions completely out of character\\, constantly.  There was some good fight scenes and funny moments\\, though many of the jokes felt like cheap nonsense (prank calling?  Really?).  I was so disappointed.  I'll never watch another Star Wars film again\\, and am considering boycotting all the Disney\/Marvel collaborations as well. It seems like a soulless mess of CG\\, gag jokes and totally awful plots these days.  No thanks!","true":true}
