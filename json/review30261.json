Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw this movie and people on this site are right just pure garbage. To much PC and social comatery.  The casino pure shit. Am a fan of the Disney praned. It is one of the best vacation destinations and cruise line top notch. But you will noticed its mostly middle or dare I say upper class whites being waited on by minorities. So I am confused by this message is disney having a coke to Jesus message or just being like typically liberals do as I say not as I due.","true":true}
