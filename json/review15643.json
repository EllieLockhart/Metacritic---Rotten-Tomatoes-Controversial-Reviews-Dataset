Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved the whole movie. It started slow\\, but picked up quick. I loved the twists on expectations. The characters got to be real people\\, rather than archetypes in service to a plot. I loved that the answers to some of the mysteries in The Force Awakens were\\, \\\"It doesn't matter.\\\" So what if Rey isn't the daughter of some awesome person we already love? Neither was Anakin. I can't wait to see where Kylo Ren's path leads. We'll get to see his true ambitions play out next movie\\, because he's already killed his puppet master. And don't even get me started on how amazing Rose is. The scene where  Admiral Holdo rammed her ship into the empire's ship nearly made me cry. Every part of it was utterly beautiful.","true":true}
