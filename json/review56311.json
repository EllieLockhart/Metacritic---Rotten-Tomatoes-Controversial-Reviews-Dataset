Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Stupendous! Best Star Wars Film except for maybe The Empire Strikes Back! Rian Johnson is a genius! Great writer-director! TLJ excels at innovation and being bold and fresh taking Star Wars in a new relevant direction with mature writing not the infantile awful Fan Service of Rise Of Skywalker! Great Character Arcs\\, Witty Dialogue\/Banter\\, a story that flowed but didn't contradict the previous installment or Episodes 1-6 but enhanced them to be sure - a great achievement\\, just sad Rian didn't finish Trilogy or at least Kennedy\/Igor let Trevorrow continue his masterpiece Duel Of The Fates from where Rian left off! Terrio & Abrams are hacks\\, worst director-writer team for Star Wars ever. PLEASE don't let them do anything else. No more Star Trek\\, no more Star Wars\\, God no Indiana Jones! Abrams is a superficial slick action director only who couldn't tell a good story to save his life! Rian Jonson is the Master Storyteller second only to Lawrence Kasdan if that. Love The Last Jedi\\, the single most complicated\\, mature\\, enriched installment of the Saga!","true":true}
