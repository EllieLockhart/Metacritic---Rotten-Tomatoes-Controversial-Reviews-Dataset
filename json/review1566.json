Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lifelong Star Wars fan I wanted to love this movie..... but unfortunately I can't even just tolerate it.  Poor story\\, poor pacing\\, bad script\\, and just not fun.   The worst part is it created continuity problems with past installments that will be hard to explain away.  I was so angry when I left the theater\\, $200 million spent on this movie and THIS is what they came up with ?","true":true}
