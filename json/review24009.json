Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great.

The marketing isnt needed for something already so popular. \\n\\n\\nThe movie makes a joke out of itself at the many serious moments. Poor use of developed characters - snoke and the storm trooper. Luke is hiding\\, but he leaves a map to find him...","true":true}
