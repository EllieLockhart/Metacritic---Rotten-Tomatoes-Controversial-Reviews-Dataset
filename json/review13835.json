{"101487":132309,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If the Force Awakens was a love letter to Star Wars fans (which it isn't\\, it's a $200M carbon copy\\, fan fiction of a New Hope) then the Last Jedi must be a hate letter to star wars fans. It's full of plot holes\\, inconsistencies with it's own story and prior movies. The people saying this story is Rey's and for the new \\\"fans\\\" are full of crap\\, this is a SEQUEL. Imagine if the Lord of the Rings last movie just threw away all their main characters or if the Hobbit just spit in Gandalfs face\\, that's pretty much this movie","true":true}
