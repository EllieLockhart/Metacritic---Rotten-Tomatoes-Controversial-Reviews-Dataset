Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Please ignore the fake outrage and clearly orchestrated negative user reviews - as a huge Star Wars fan and movie lover\\, I can say this is among the best Star Wars films ever made\\, recapturing the goofy na\u00efvet\u00e9 of the originals\\, while offering an emotional depth mostly missing from the rest. A worthy echo of Empire; a phenomenal steward of the flame of Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa many years later; and creating iconic characters in Rey\\, Kylo Ren and Po\\, who can go on to become the centrepiece of the Star Wars universe for a new generation. What an achievement.","true":true}
