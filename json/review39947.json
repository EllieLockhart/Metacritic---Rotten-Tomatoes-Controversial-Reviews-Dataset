Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is easily the worst stsr wars movie ever.  They injected sjw feminist agenda into  it. Destroyed everything we loved about Luke. Destroyed star wars as we know it. None of the story arcs set up by the force awakens were remotely paid off . Actually subverted which now makes the force awakens unwatchable.  This trilogy now has nothing to look forward to for 9 which I won't see. Until they get rid of Kathleen Kennedy\\,  rian Johnson\\,  kiri hart\\, pablo Hidalgo I won't give Disney aboutget penny.  A nd ive givenucasfilm thousands as luke Skywalker and Ben kenobi were my favorite heroes since childhood. Rian Johnson am indie film director was allowed to direct .one of the largestabd breasy cinematic ops in history and he did exactly whatyou might think an indie film director would do to this size a movie. He burned the whole series to the ground. Awful.  Dont even sneak in and waste your time.  Its hurtful to your soul what he did to luke.","true":true}
