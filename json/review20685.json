Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've watched The Force Awakens countless times\\, i've watched the Prequels millions of times\\, and i will watch The Rise of Skywalker another billions of times..but The Last Jedi? Once is enough..once is enough to insult the memory i had on the saga i love so much..even the prequels looks gold compared to this one..","true":true}
