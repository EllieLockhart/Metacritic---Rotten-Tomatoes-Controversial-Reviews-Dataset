Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a terrible movie and terrible trilogy.  Just like Force Awakens\\, The Last Jedi rehashes plot points\\, phrases and entire conversations (very unoriginal) from Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.  Characters are under developed\\, even characters we know from previous films seem like such different characters that we know nothing about them and then those characters are gone in one way or another before we even get to know them\\, in my opinion why waste any of your movie on these characters if they are gone in a little bit anyway\\, very disappointing.  And then characters you wish were developed more aren't developed well or at all.  Many things that happen don't seem like things that should have happened not going to explain them all but one involved Leia and another Luke\\, and there were a couple others.  Each movie in this trilogy so far\\, like I said about the last movie\\, are trying to be too many things at the same time and because of this they try to make the first movie in the trilogy into it's own stand-alone movie when it should have been a setup movie to develop characters and then The Last Jedi should have had a lot of good action (it had some good action\\, some boring) and the next one would have the climax and conclusion.  But instead all of them are trying to evenly develop characters throughout without really answering anything well.  And we are all left not caring about anyone in the movie except R2 and Chewie.  Only thing good about the movie looks beautiful and had a couple cool action moments.","true":true}
