Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When the movies poster looks like a period stain\\, you know there is no one competent at the helm anymore. Star Wars has been dead since the prequels.  Everything about this movie doesn't make sense\\, and is merely cosplay\\, these are people playing at being the part\\, all toe further \\\"representation\\\"\\, but the result is that they and the narrative becomes a superficial hollow shell.  Look a girl with force powers\\, a girl storm trooper\\, a girl commander\\, who needs to explain anything\\, they were \\\"empowered\\\" women\\, don't question it\\, don't think\\, you are paying for propaganda.   I never thought there would be star wars films so bad they would make me respect Lucas's prequels\\, as bad as those were\\, they actually felt like star wars.  This\\, just spits on the corpse as it feeds on it\\, because that is all these social progressive types can do\\, infiltrate and copy and subvert\\, they do not create anything genuine because its simply about power\\, and Kathleen Kennedy is going to destroy the value of the star wars in 2 films after this\\, and then she will take a swipe at destroying Indiana Jones.  This is what happens when you give the #imwithher crowd free reign\\, they seek to destroy the \\\"patriarchy\\\" which really means they seek to destroy all things good.  They don't understand what makes a good narrative\\, mythic archetypes and all traditional things be damned\\, they seek to destroy it all.","true":true}
