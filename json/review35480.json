Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi feels so drastically different from any other Star Wars film that it takes some time to get used to\\, but once it settles it\u2019s really great. It\u2019s sometimes frustrating yet often satisfying. It\u2019s overlong and with a weak plot\\, but the movie rallies with rich emotion that satisfies in unexpected ways. It has great depth that\u2019s ultimately fulfilling. Of course there\u2019s so much more to say\\, but without delving into spoilers\\, this is a great movie that I loved quite a lot\\, but it\u2019s a step down from The Force Awakens.","true":true}
