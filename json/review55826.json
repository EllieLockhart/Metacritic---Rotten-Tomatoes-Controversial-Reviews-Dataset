Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Possibly the worst in the franchise. Without giving any spoilers\\, the film was dull and had a lot of useless time fillers. All the build up that the Force Awakens had was completely lost. \\n\\nIt was basically a bad Marvel film. The humor was forced in a movie that it didn't belong to. Attack of the Clones shares the same score from audience\\, but at least that film had a story and developed characters.","true":true}
