Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Super fun\\, entertaining movie that was too recycled\\, slow\\, and pointless at times to be favorite for me. A lot of it seemed like copy\/paste from previous movies: beginning AND final scene\/hoth\\, Rey training with Luke\/Luke training with Yoda\\, gambling guy\/Lando etc. The whole idea of the ships just following each other slowly was.. well\\, slow. Rose and Finn's side plot was just pointless. They do a series of video-game like missions and end up failing anyway. Finally\\, Snoke's death scene and Leah's marry-poppins floating scene were sadly disappointing. Fun movie and glad I saw it\\, but it did its job and nothing more: It made money.
