Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not only was this an objectively bad movie with terrible pacing\\, a nonsensical plot(even within the context of science fiction)\\, and cringe-worthy dialogue\\, it manages to completely subvert everything about the original trilogy.\\n\\nCharacters are sidelined\\, given the ultimate power of Deus Ex Machina\\, and outright misused. Every plot point and message from the original trilogy has been subverted and invalidated. \\n\\nIf you are a fan of the original trilogy and you haven't seen this movie\\, DON'T. Keep Star Wars alive in your mind. I have been a fan of Star Wars and Luke Skywalker in particular since I was 4 years old\\, and I can never again see the original trilogy. I am utterly heartbroken.","true":true}
