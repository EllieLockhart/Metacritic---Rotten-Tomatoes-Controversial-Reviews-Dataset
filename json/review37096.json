Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The one word I keep bringing up is disappointment. There was so much promise that the force awakens had set up. So many questions were going to be answered. This movie just takes everything that weliked in the froce awakens and throws it right out the window in favor of making a movie that almost doesn't even resemble star wars. Bad writing bogs this down as well\\, with an incoherent storyline that mixes a very dark mood with unfunny jokes. there is also no sense of danger in this movie\\, as it takes what we had in the last movie\\, which threatened the Galaxy\\, and turns it into the lives of a few resistance soldiers. This gave the movie a feeling of overall unimportance. I know now how it must have felt coming out of the phantom menace in theaters. Congrats to Rian Johnson for giving us the weakest movie and ruining the name of the star wars franchise. Now excuse me while I debate whether I'm going to return for episode 9.","true":true}
