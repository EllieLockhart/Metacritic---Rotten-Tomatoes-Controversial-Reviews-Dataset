Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Partially felt the need to write a review because I'm tired of dealing with the\\, \\\"[You're a bad person for not liking what I like crowd].\\\"\\n\\nI didn't like this empire remake and really hate the franchise resistance towards having characters struggle or work hard for their goals. Nothing but plot convience and made up powers galore. \\n\\nSeriously if you know someone who likes the movie ask them this\\, who is more of a marry sue\\, Poe Dameron or Luke Skywalker.
