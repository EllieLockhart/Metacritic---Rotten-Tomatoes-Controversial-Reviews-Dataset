Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Force Awakens did a good job of setting up the story for The Last Jedi but only to be fuched up by Rian Johnson.  Feel sorry for the next guy since Rian should get fired for this... the story is butchered beyond repair.. just a bad bad nightmare. Someone should do an open source version of Star Wars... will turn out better than these clowns at Disney. Fuch me.. Poppins Leia\\, Pussy Skywalker\\, etc","true":true}
