It reminds me of when I first played the fantastic Shenmue on the dreamcast. In fact they are pretty similar games in comparison. I love the beautiful open city full of culture\\, neon lights\\, restaurants\\, arcades\\, clubs\\, bars\\, casinos and erm porno theater's! There is so much to see and do in Yakuza.\r\rThe game looks stunning and has an engaging story line. TheYakuza 0 is a great game.

The action and fighting is smooth and controls well. The missions are varied and interesting. There are many well rounded characters and the two heroes are well crafted and their stories are enjoyable to play through.\r\rIt is story heavy so be prepared for lots of reading. I personally enjoy this style of RPG.\r\rThere is so much to do in this game\\, playing old Sega arcade games\\, pool\\, darts\\, karaoke\\, bowling\\, RC car racing\\, fishing and much more. There's so much that you can lose your self for hours just roaming round the city and finding new things to do.\r\rI'd highly recommend this game to fans of the series and new players.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
