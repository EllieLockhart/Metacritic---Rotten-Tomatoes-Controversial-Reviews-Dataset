Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you are coming here to find out if the movie is \\\"good\\\" or \\\"bad\\\" you do not need to bother seeing the movie at all because you will gain a bias one way or the other\\, which in turn will make it harder for you to form your own opinions of the film itself (this applies to any movie for that matter). I would suggest this movie to anyone\\, I thought it was a great addition to the franchise! In the current world of social media and news updates being sent to your phone\\, it is hard to shield yourself from any potential biased views of this movie. So I did my best to not go deeper than a headline popping up on a news feed or any post containing the name \\\"Star Wars\\\" to better prepare my mind to make my own opinions of the film. Now having said that it was pretty much impossible to not hear about the negative press and reaction The Last Jedi was receiving from fans.\\n\\nMy intent for writing this is not to spoil the movie for anyone and some of the things I will say might do that. Please stop reading here and GO SEE IT! \\n********SPOILER ALERT********\\n\\nAfter seeing the film I personally think that people need to reassess their own thoughts and ask themselves what they thought of the film going into the theater. Yes\\, I can see where people could be angered by the movie's take on Luke\\, but I think those people are going no deeper than the surface. I would argue that this movie is one of the deepest films in the Star Wars saga\\, but again this is my own opinion. There were things I was initially upset about\\, but thinking back to the film I realized were actually good filmmaking and story-telling decisions. In addition I felt somethings could have been omitted\\, one of which (this might just be me seeing too much into something) being somewhat of an introduced though not clearly defined love triangle between Finn\\, Rey and Rose\\, I did not see the need for that and frankly I am tired of love triangle subplots in all movies (it to me is a hack way to divide an audience\\, plus the hashtags would suck #Fose or #Ronn or # Frey or #Ren <--- O.O). The only thing I was disappointed with is really a minor point and that is the lack of emphasis on BB-9e\\, I realize this is a dumb thing to get mad about but I really am annoyed with there being so much coverage over the introduction of an evil bb unit and though it is an impactful character for the storyline there is little to no screen time for the beloved resistance droid's evil doppelg\u00e4nger. It is just was the understanding that \\\"oh\\, BB-9e is just another droid that is really only created to sell toys... got it\\, emo BB8 cool!\\\"  SO my personal take on Rian Johnson's take on the franchise is a unique one and does not tarnish the good Star Wars name but rather adds a new level of depth to it! The movie was nostalgic\\, immersive and exciting as well as touching and also throws in the perfect amount surprisingly funny material.","true":true}
