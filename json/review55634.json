Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not the Star Wars movie you were looking for!\\n\\nThis film is a slap in the face to Star Wars fans and the fact that it has positive reviews from critics makes me question that these critics are neutral and not paid off by Disney.\\n\\nThis trilogy should have been so easy to hit a home run. The Force Awakens was pretty good\\, I liked Rey\\, Finn\\, and Poe\\, but it had a few plot problems that I was hoping VIII would solve. Nope\\, it just dropped them altogether. Knights of Ren? Gone. Snoke as potentially the most powerful force wielder we have seen? Gone. Luke!? I can't. \\n\\nWhile there are some good things\\, like the score\\, which is arguably one of the best in the saga\\, and the overall look of the film\\, the story\\, the characters\\, the oddly placed humor\\, just makes for a bad movie let alone a Star Wars movie. Forget the \\\"minor\\\" stuff\\, like dropping (via gravity) bombs in space. The major plotline of this movie makes no sense! How did no one question this at Disney?\\n\\nMark Hamill tried to warn us. No matter what they do in Episode IX this trilogy will seem so disjointed. Years from now when you watch all three back to back it will not sense. The timeline is screwy and the storylines don't carry over.\\n\\nRian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy have destroyed Star Wars. I currently prefer the prequels to this trilogy.","true":true}
