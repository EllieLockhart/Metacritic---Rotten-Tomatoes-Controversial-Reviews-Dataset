Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson ruined this movie. It was very preachy in a bad way. \\\"we don't need a hero\\, we need a leader.\\\" Star wars was built on rugged hero's acting on impulse. Han didn't shoot first.. Han shot. We see Poe Tannons whole plan\\, which takes up a large part of the movie\\, turn out to actually destroy most of the rebellion. Spoiler Alert: snoke dies with no back story\\, Rey comes from no where but can defeat trained Jedi with no training\\, Leia is not actually dead even though she could have easily been finished off\\, an nobody engineer gets a back story and becomes a pilot and saves fin from making a heroic save because it's \\\"about saving the ones you love\\\"  but Rian has time to go to a wealthy planet just to attack the \\nmilitary industrial complex \\\"we sell to both sides\\\".  Rian Johnson is worse than Jar Jar Binks.","true":true}
