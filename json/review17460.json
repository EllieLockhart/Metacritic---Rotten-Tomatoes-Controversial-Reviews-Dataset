Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw this movie twice and the more I think about it the more I like it.\\nThis Star Wars movie gives more character development than any other in the series. The movie continued the parallel of the original trilogy but diverges at healthy place for plot development. \\nThe themes of the movie are consistent across all character stories\\, and each have appropriate life lessons for their respective characters.\\nBeyond just the interaction of the characters\\, the major theme reflects on the legacy of the franchise itself. This may reflect many of the angry reactions to this movie. The legacy of the in-universe characters had negative consequences\\, and the build up of a sequel trilogy has enraged many fans that say that it did not live up.","true":true}
