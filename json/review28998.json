Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really enjoyed this\\, if the movie had been any shorter\\, I feel like a lot of stories they were playing out would not have paid off. Was not a perfect movie by any means but a very enjoyable Star Wars film.","true":true}
