Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A sad day for Star Wars fans. This movie was missing everything I love about Star Wars. It felt like director Dian Johnson was trying to make a marvel superhero movie. Way too much humor polishing. Also\\, there were so many plot holes and undeveloped characters. Rose and Fin's subplot was completely unnecessary. Why make something fresh and new at the expense of leaving out everything that makes a Star Wars movie a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
