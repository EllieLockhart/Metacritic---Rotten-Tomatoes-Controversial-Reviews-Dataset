Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This disjointed mess of a story could ultimately be franchise killing now that the fans including myself are waking up from a nastalga based stupor and are seeing through the eye candy. I couldnt disagree with the critic consensus. more. I would say that The Last Jedi dishonors the saga's rich legacy in a reckless attempt at creating a new narrative - and delivers a bipolar manic story that can't even keep up with itself. An awful edition full of plot holes\\, bad jokes\\, and wasted potential","true":true}
