Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful. I've never seen such a disconnect between the critics consensus and the actual movie. Many of the critics made positive comparisons to Empire - and that carries significant weight for many Star Wars fans. I admit that raised expectations for me. I remember the first time I saw Empire Strikes Back. It was enchanting and mesmerizing and incredibly entertaining. And even though I was just a little boy\\, I knew I had seen something special. Indeed\\, Empire has become the measuring stick against which all Star Wars movies are measured. Unfortunately\\, much against what the critics have said\\, Star Wars 8 doesn't even come close to measuring up. I don't want to spoil any of the plot\\, such as it is\\, but if you're thinking about spending ten bucks a ticket maybe reconsider and wait till it comes out on rentals and spend far less. You'll probably thank me later. :)","true":true}
