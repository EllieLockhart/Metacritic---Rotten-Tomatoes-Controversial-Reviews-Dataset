I personally really enjoyed some parts of the game like beating up Abby\\, combat\\, graphics\\, characters. But the story line was somewhat mediocre. Especially 10 hours of Abby gameplay was really stressful and painful for me.  On the other hand I missed Joel so much the entire game. It was painful to see how he was tortured and killed. But I would definitely recommend this game to everyone just to let them see what this game has to offer.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
