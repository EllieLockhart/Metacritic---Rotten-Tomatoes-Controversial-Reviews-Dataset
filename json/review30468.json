Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Shameful\\, disgraceful and insulting. \\nI'm actually offended by this movie! \\n\\nI'm all for diversity but not when its contrived and patronising and ruins the story. \\nI mean the whole Casino subplot with Rose and Finn went nowhere and achieved nothing.  And why couldn't Leia or Ackbar have made the 'sacrifice'? Giving it to a purple headed Laura Dern\\, just cheapened the whole thing.\\n\\nStory-wise\\, it was an absolute mess!  Did they even have a Screenplay?? Or did Johnson just string a bunch of committee demands together? \\n\\n\\\"Tick box... Tick box... Tick box... Tick box... Tick box... There you go! There's your Star Thingy movie. It came outta my backside but you better eat it up or I'll call you a bigot!\\\"\\n\\nGo to hell Disney!","true":true}
