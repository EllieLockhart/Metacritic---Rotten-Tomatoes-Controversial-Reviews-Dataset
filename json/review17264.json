Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted this to be the epic movie it needed to be to take the franchise back to legendary status but it just falls flat. I hate to say it but it was pretty boring.. I wish they would stay closer to the style of why the star wars movies were great.. Long drawn out stories and trying to make the audience laugh every 10 minutes with cheesy jokes just doesn't do it.. Rey was great.. She is one of the only bright spots that is left in the franchise.. ","true":true}
