Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Never have I been so bored watching a StarWars movie.  I left the theater wondering if I had seen the same movie as all the critics who have it 5 stars.  \\n\\nThis movie had holes the size of moon craters in the plot\\, terrible dialogue\\, inappropriate humor and really went nowhere fast. \\n\\nNew characters were brought in seemingly for no other reason than to fulfill some type of affirmative action checklist.  Rose adds nothing and her scenes with Finn on the casino planet were on par with Jar Jar Binks scenes in Phantom Menace\\, she is that annoying.  \\n\\nThis movie is preachy too.  Chewie turns vegetarian\\, rich people are bad\\, men are stupid\\, capitalism is evil and kept animals should be released (but don't worry about freeing the slave children).\\n\\nThe old characters behave irratically.  Luke tossing his \\\"laser sword\\\" over his shoulder...dumb.  Yoda burns the Jedi books\\, destroying their history and legacy reminded me of ISIS destroying ancient ruins.  Nothing they do fits with the characters that we knew.  Among the worst scenes were the flying Leia Poppins and Luke's death via astral projection.  Such a middle finger to these characters that deserve better than these cheesy scenes.\\n\\nThe characters brought to us in The Force Awakens (Rey\\, Poe\\, Finn\\, Kylo) do not really move forward.  Still left in the dark about who Snoke is (was).  Instead of working on developing these characters\\, we follow Rose on her mission to nowhere doing nothing.  Opportunities wasted.\\n\\nFor some reason I had a feeling this movie was not going to live up to TFA or other episodes.  I knew I was right when within the first few minutes the first of many idiotic jokes were told.  Poe's call to Hux is not the brand of humor that is used in Star Wars\\, it was juvenile and dumb.  And\\, unfortunately it set the tone for me for the rest of the movie.\\n\\nI really can't say if I'll see the next movie.  It really depends on wfho is directing it and what characters are in it.  I don't like Rose enough at all to sit through another movie where she eats up a lot of screen time.  I may have to bid adieu to my favorite franchise in movie history.","true":true}
