Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was hoping for a better film after seeing the 7\\, was even more disapointed than expecting...\\nMost of the jokes were awful\\, the characters aren't developed in this one two (maybe in the 9 who knows?)\\, some wait at some point\\, the part with finn and rose is just useless in the story (just to introduce a new cantina scene (STOP PLEASE) and a message for animal abuse but useless for the story)\\, two other animals to sell merchandise\\, not an alien with a role in sight (even rogue one did it)\\, that moment with Le\u00efa is garbage (I know she's a skywalker but it's just poorly made)\\, the scene with the mirrors useless too\\, only the last planet is beautifully made with all the color contrast.\\nI have so much more to say but It would be spoil\\, so maybe as I saw a lot after the 53th time it's enjoyable\\, but let's face it\\, it's not about being a good or bad star wars and how it include himself in the saga here\\, but it's just a bad movie. Not worth you're money and your time\\, only for Star Wars fan. (but not all of them obviously...)","true":true}
