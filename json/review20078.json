Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was long. The pacing was off and the entire movie was filled with meaningless subplots. Now don't get me wrong\\, I love Star Wars. What I don't like is throwaway characters\\, forced humor\\, and the mess that became of Luke Skywalker. Went in excited\\, left thoroughly disappointed.","true":true}
