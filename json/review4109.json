Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Brilliant movie with quite a few WTF-moments\\, but in my oppinion good ones.\\n\\nA litle bit of Spoiler below: \\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nI have to admit I am unsure if I like what Rian did with some of the caracters. But in my oppinion this movie takes the conecept of the force that has been \\\"owned by the Skywalkers\\\" from the end of episode III until episode VII and give it back to the galaxy. \\n\\nSo do not hate on the broom kid at the end! =)","true":true}
