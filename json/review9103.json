Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Full of surprises and shocking twists as well as one of the most beautifully shot lightsaber duels to date. However\\, misplaced humor throughout the movie\\, as well as the seemingly pointless mission to Canto Bight are sore spots that are a little difficult to overlook. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie for what it was: an emotionally\\, character-driven roller coaster ride that had plenty of twists\\, turns\\, and sudden drops. The cinematography was likely the best in the entire saga and the acting did not disappoint. Chalk it up to poor writing. Take out some of those cheesy\\, poorly-timed one-liners (and the entire Canto Bight mission) and you've got one of the best Star Wars films to date. Nonetheless\\, I am very much excited at what Star Wars could be\\, especially in Episode IX.","true":true}
