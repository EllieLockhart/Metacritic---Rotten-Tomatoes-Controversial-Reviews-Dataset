Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely terrible what an utter disgrace this film is it\u2019s full of plot holes\\, it\u2019s got a pointless stupid contradictory narrative\\, it ruins the originals and doesn\u2019t even make sense with what happened in the film before it\\, what a joke.
