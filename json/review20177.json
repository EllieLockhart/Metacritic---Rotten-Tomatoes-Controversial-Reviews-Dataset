Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was okay\\, not the worst movie\\, Star Wars or otherwise\\, I have seen not the best. Not at all what I expected and that was a good and a bad thing. The idea of the mystery box and questions left unanswered and holes left open in the plot plagued this movie. Seems like so much was left out that could have been added value to the film and yet other stuff that could have been left out and hardly missed was ruminated on for to long. 3\/5 stars","true":true}
