Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson obviously never understood the original movies. Luke Skywalker can be anything except that regardless of the degree of his failure\\, he will never lose hope! That's the whole point of these movies.\\nThis movie was just a series of shallow and dumb plot points filled with cheesy lines and forgettable characters! I enjoyed The Force Awakens and liked Rey's character very much. I wish they had developed her character at least a little bit through this movie!","true":true}
