Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Startlingly mediocre and disjointed from front to finish. Rian Johnson seems to be talented but unable to operate within established frameworks of lore and tone leading to a jarring and awkward movie that seem to be more referential to star Wars than a part of the saga it owes its existence to. Characters behave in abrasive and unrealistic manner and plotting and pacing seem cobbled together like a scrap book of unconnected ideas held together under a vague and poorly developed agenda. \\n\\nIt is long\\, boring\\, and suffering from an identity crisis that it seems Rian was unable to resolve. Whatever issues people have with the gender politics asside this is fundamentally a clumsy film with moments that tempt brilliance before their Jungian shadow brings your expectation crashing into a dull dissappointment at the absence of any meaningful payoffs. A galaxy of lore disregarded by a talented but self absorbed director who seems to forget Star Wars is only a thing because of the value fans put on it and the dollars they bring. \\n\\nA wasted opportunity by a talented director who just couldn't figure out how to make a good Star wars movie and submitted this very rough draft the evening it was due on teachers desk.","true":true}
