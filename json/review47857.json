Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"where to start..... the was so many parts that were not memorable that Shar should have been. character decisions are not explained and character build ups from previous film were cut short and again with no explanation. the Lore seems lost is quite a few area and the creative team seems to have not been on point in alot if areas.Very disappointed.
