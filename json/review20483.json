Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a Star Wars fan sense I was 5\\, I couldn't even finish this shitty film\\, it insults the legacy of all the hero's of the original series\\, it's overtly sexist and the characters are painfully unrelatable. Then Mary Sue perfect at everything with no effort at all Ray is just a juggernaut of  plot armored stupidity. I use to hate the prequels but now i think they deserve a second look at least the plot was good.","true":true}
