Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Simply trash. Not only did this monstrosity fail to have a stable plot\\, it failed to distinguish a man character. This \\\"Star Wars\\\" was riddled with a cancerous plague of Pc agenda that Disney clearly had no intention on hiding. I am more disappointed\\, however\\, with the fact that I stayed til the end. For the simple reason that I had a sliver of hope that it would redeem itself. But I had never been so wrong. This video was so poorly written\\, directed and shown that I wouldn't even give it any space on my hard drive if I had the choice to download it for free. Disney\\, you will burn in the eternal fires of Hell for this one.","true":true}
