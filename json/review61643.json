We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"First off not a \\\"BOT\\\"\r\rOkay here is my review of TLOU2.\r\rGameplay:\rPlay's Similar to the first game with some new extended Options to it such as Jumping and crawling\\, Yet for me it feels sort of slippery and not as fluid as the first game.Also it is more a movie then it is a game which can be good or bad\\,In this case it was bad\\, I like Interactive games such as the Walking dead ones\\, But this game is really just like watching a long movie with very little gameplay.\rWhen it does Click back into gameplay the enemies do vary and can show some smarts\\, But I also seen many AI in my gameplay that were dumb.\r\rGraphics:Naughty Dog I will give props where due\\, This game is Beautiful\\,The world feels Alive\\, Colors can be both stunning and depressing\\\"In a good way\\\"\\, The details in the faces are spot on with real life.\r\rSound:\rHit or miss for me\\, Some things sound good while others sound odd to me\\, Such as some of the voice acting\\, Most hit the marks with what lines they are given\\, And a few others sound like they phoned it in and wanted to walk away from the script.\r\rStory:\rThis story is a mess\\, They take everything good from number one and ruin it with this one\\, I still like Ellie as I did in the first game\\, But Joel when he was Present he feels \\\"Off\\\"\\, He does not seem like the same guy we grew to know from the first game\\, I do not mind the story moving forward\\, But this game seems like they Erased the first one and wanted to start over with new leads.\rIt's a story about hate and revenge yet by the conclusion it is not even that\\, It leads up to nothing happening besides them all walking away!\r\rConclusion:\rThey had a chance to really make a mark with this game but they blew it really in every way\\, Not worth the price\\, If you can I say wait for a price cut or buy it used.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
