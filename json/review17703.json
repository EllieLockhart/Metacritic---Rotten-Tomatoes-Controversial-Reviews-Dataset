Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It certainty didn't go the way I expected. That being said\\, I really enjoyed the movie once I got past my expectations. The movie was epic\\, funny\\, unexpected\\, and above all entertaining. Go see it and leave your story at home and go in with a open mind and it will be on of the best Star Wars movies yet.","true":true}
