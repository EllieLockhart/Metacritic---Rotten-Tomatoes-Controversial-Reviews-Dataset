Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Is it the best Star Wars ever made\\, of course not! \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" is a decent film\\, the story itself is a little weak but if you count all the incredible action sequences and a certain character making a cameo\\, it is pretty exciting to watch. As a true die-hard fan I can say this movie is fun too watch but it could've been better.","true":true}
