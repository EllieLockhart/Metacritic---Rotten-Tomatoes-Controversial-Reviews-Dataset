Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really really bad movie. China calls it a Social justice propaganda movie and i'd Have to agree...\\nThis movie is absolutely brimming with useless subplots \\,pathetic characters (mostly the males) and terrible plot design. I could write 3 pages on the subject but I won't waste my time. I won't be seeing the next Star Wars because this one was absolutely so terrible.","true":true}
