Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can go on a whole speech on how it doesn't follow a logical plot\\, how they use real world humor in a setting that takes you out of the fantasy\\, and how it doesn't follow the pre-introduced \\\"rules\\\" of the Star Wars Universe and several characters are ultimately unnecessary.\\n\\nBut\\, in the end..the movie is actually pretty decent as a movie\\, but terrible as a Star War movie. If you plan of watching it don't go in expecting a Star Wars space opera...expect watching a fun popcorn movie that has no bearing.","true":true}
