Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was both nostalgic but also fresh. Everything Force Awakens should have been. Your entire persective changes throughout and you don't know what to think. It's a thrill ride and one of the best Star Wars films to date.","true":true}
