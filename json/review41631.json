Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is Horrible! The writing in this movie is non-sensible and downright disrespectful to movies that came before it. This movie offers very little new to the franchise and instead brings down beloved characters to their lowest for the sake of boosting up its new characters which btw the are poorly developed characters and feel forced. The only redeeming qualities this movie has is that the visuals and special effects look good also with the use of practical effects. The Action is decent but lacking compared to prior films. If you love Star Wars (especially the original trilogy)\\, I highly recommend avoiding this awful film!","true":true}
