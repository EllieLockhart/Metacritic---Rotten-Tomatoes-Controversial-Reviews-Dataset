Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I tried to give it two and a half Stars but the more I thought about it the worst I liked it it seems like more of a finale and in poor taste killing off Luke too early and him not even caring about the Jedi Order or anything the comedy was rather stand up ish Princess Leia having such powers all of a sudden and Ray having mastered so much power in such a short time very implausible and snoke being killed so easily doesn't seem like he had any power at all","true":true}
