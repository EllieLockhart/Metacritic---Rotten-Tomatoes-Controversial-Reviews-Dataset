I keep seeing people say Abby got a good ending she didn\u2019t she lost everything and only has Lev left which is exactly what Joel had. Joel was miserable then he found Ellie and now it\u2019s happening with Abby and Lev. The graphics are wonderful and the story is good but has some downs. Honestly I felt bad for Abby and I never thought I would have empathy for her. I cared for Ellie tooo overall the game made me question everything I was trying to figure out if I wanted Abby dead or Alive I liked her but I loved Joel but deep down I knew Joel wasn\u2019t a good person. People keep saying Abby is evil but it\u2019s not true she doesn\u2019t kill innocent people and at the beginning of the game she tells her group not to kill Ellie because she\u2019s innocent and didn\u2019t kill her dad. Abby is a good person because she saves Lev and his sister. Ellie and Abby our the same both lose their father and got lost in revenge. Honestly I think Ellie doesn\u2019t know who she really is- I feel like she wants to forgive Joel and she does when she doesn\u2019t kill Abby. But through out the game Ellie is ruthless and angry which she should her dad died but at the same time she\u2019s lost she\u2019s not the Ellie from the first game she\u2019s older and darker. This game gives me mixed feelings it\u2019s morally grey which is realistic no one is perfect. But I liked the story because it was realistic every action has a consequence. Abby killing Joel made Ellie kill all her friends. And Joel killing Abbys dad made her come for him. This game shouldn\u2019t be a 0\/10 the gameplay is fun and the graphics are amazing. Another thing is the game wasn\u2019t ruined by sjw you were just mad Joel died. Yes there is a gay character and guess what there was a gay character in the first game. Lev being trans  is an interesting plot and helps you build a bond with him honestly Lev is one of the most bad ass characters. Ok I\u2019m done I respect your opinion if you dislike the game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
