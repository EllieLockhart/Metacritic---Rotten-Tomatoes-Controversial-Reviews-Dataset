Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I remember seeing Episode IV in the theatre when it first came out. I remember seeing Episode V and being shocked along with the entire audience when Darth Vader said\\, \\\"I am your father.\\\" And when Episode VI came out the unbelievable joy when Luke was saved by his father. I love Star Wars. However I am not a fan that thinks I own this story and could write it better. I love that Rey is a nobody in Episode VII and remains a nobody in VIII because Anikan was a nobody\\, a slave. I love that she is a fast learner\\, that she approaches The Force with the awe and wonder of a child and BELIEVES. If you remember Yoda said Luke failed in his training because he didn't believe. I love The Force projections between Rey and Ben\\, It absolutely forces the audience to see how Ben came to be Kylo. Leia\\, Han and Luke were never perfect. Fans that don't want to see characters develop\\, face challenges\\, fail and still remain interesting aren't really fans. Watch TLJ again\\, watch the original trilogy again\\, it's really cut from the same cloth as the others.","true":true}
