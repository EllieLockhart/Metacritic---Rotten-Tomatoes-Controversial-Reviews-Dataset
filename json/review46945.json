Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"We waited 30 years to see Luke and this is what they gave us? Disney you have wrecked Star Wars and have killed off the best characters in cinamitic history in two movies. Truly disappointed!","true":true}
