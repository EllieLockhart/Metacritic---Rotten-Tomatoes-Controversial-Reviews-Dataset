Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film felt more like a hackneyed attempt to be Star Wars: Guardians of the Galaxy Edition. All the cool things that Abrams setup in The Force Awakens (TFA) has been torn apart and shat on by this Rian. \\n\\nThe opening sequence\\, while visually stunning\\, makes zero sense. How can one guy in an X-Wing take out 12 turbo lasers and one bomber take out a dreadnought class warship?\\n\\nUnfortunately\\, the film never fully recovers from this issue. There are a lot of plot holes that somehow made it into the movie\\, plot devices that completely ignore the canon which came before it\\, and multiple story arches that make zero sense and probably shouldn't have been in the film.\\n\\nWas this a good space movie? It was pretty decent. Is this a good Star Wars film? Not even close.","true":true}
