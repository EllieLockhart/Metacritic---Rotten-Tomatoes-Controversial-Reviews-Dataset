Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"not as good as the critics say but not as bad the audience would lead you to believe. After that decent but unoriginal force awakens this film is a big let down. Instead of building on what JJ started and doing something original Rian chose to barely move the plot forward and have a bunch of NOTHING happen. Leia flying in space tops Jar Jar as the worst thing ever in a star wars film\\nSetting the entire movie on a space ship slowly flying away from another space ship is an odd choice. Doesnt seem like much of a war. Very little explanation how the empire took over the galaxy in a few days even after its NOT the death star blew up. Scenes with Luke and Rey and the Rey\/Kylo relationship were handled well\\neverything on the rebel ship and space vegas were pointless and bad. Fans of Finn will be disappointed. Why these movies refuse to give us a buddy cop style team up with Crazy Poe and Finn the janitor is beyond me. They are two most likable characters.\\nHuge misstep by disney","true":true}
