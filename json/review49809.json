Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yes I really loved Star Wars it was one of the first movies I ever saw a the theater. I have followed the Star Wars universe and Disney destroyed it ended with the death of Luke sky walker. Kind of like logan. Of yes the Mary Sue. Or putting femal gases on traditionally male roles. Bad for kids rotten for adults. Let the heros of old die broken and week.","true":true}
