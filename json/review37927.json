Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The second movie in a trilogy series is often a bridge between the first and the final film with no big  purpose or action. Not true for The Last Jedi. This film could have stood by itself. There was tons of action\\, story\\, heartfelt moments and laughable moments. I can't wait to see how this story ends with the final film.","true":true}
