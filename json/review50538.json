Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"1st review I've ever written just to say plz don't listen to the bad reviews. If u want same ol same ol Star Wars that's been around for 40 yrs than this isn't your movie\\, but if your ready for something new\\, fresh and exciting strap in and take the journey. I only watch the best stuff and I'm a screenwriter of some huge amazing stories\\, ladies n gents\\, this was THE BEST MOVIE IVE EVER SEEN. Enjoy!!","true":true}
