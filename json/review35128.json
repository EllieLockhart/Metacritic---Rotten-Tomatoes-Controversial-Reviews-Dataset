Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The force awakens promised a great new trilogy but the last Jedi only followed this promise up with a great trailer. The story is sketchy and the character depth that exists in previous films seems to have been forgotten. The audience has no idea how the puppet (sorry already forgotten its name) has come to be leading the new empire as there is no back story\\, but that\u2019s ok because after he\u2019s easily killed off halfway through\\, the empire seems more than happy with him being replaced by some young guy with Batman\u2019s voice. The selection process in the empire clearly likes to promote young ambitious people with limited leadership experience. The end isn\u2019t any better after Luke sacrifices himself to allow the rebels to get away\\, despite at least two other sacrifices by other characters previous to this that allowed the rebels to get away. The last time they get away though they decide (for no apparent reason) they now have enough to defeat the empire. Perhaps they have seen fundamental flaws in the empires recruitment and selection process? In summary\\, this one is for the kids and gonna make the old school Star Wars fans pretty angry...","true":true}
