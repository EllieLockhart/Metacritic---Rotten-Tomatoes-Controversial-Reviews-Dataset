Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was really disappointing and deflating\\, Amazing scenes from Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley. Completely inconsistent characterisation of Luke\\, the established Luke would not have acted\/reacted to certain things in the way that he does in this film. It was great to see a more diverse cast\\, and more women on both sides\\, and just having female fighter pilots\/secondary characters who are working as a whole is enough. That's more important and says more than introducing new and not entirely necessary female characters. It was also way too heavy handed with the politics. Star Wars has always had a political undercurrent\\, but the point is that it is not thrown in your face in a way that seems contrived. It is the makeup of the universe\\, with this film it seems like they are telling you that arms dealers are bad (I mean\\, duh!)\\, that good\/evil aren't always clear cut(again\\, duh!) and that eating meat is bad (but only if it's cute\\, you can catch and eat big unusual fish\\, and milk a random ugly creature for your own benefit). They kind of decimate the Star Wars universe with their treatment of the force. And when Luke is \\\"training\\\" Rey he is uncharacteristically humourous\\, in a way that doesn't make sense especially considering he has been in exile for so long. It would sort of make sense if he had gone a bit loopy like Yoda had in Empire Strikes Back. But it also doesn't make sense that he would want to destroy the Jedi's because he realised that from evil can come from Jedi training (he knew that already\\, why would he suddenly change his mind about his philosophy). I felt confused and stressed while watching the movie. There were incredible moments and it was not all bad. But it was not a coherent film\\, and it certainly wasn't Star Wars. I don't have a problem with Rey's parents not being important\\, but the reveal was messy and I don't understand why she is so powerful if she wasn't at the Jedi training school nor had any real training since. I loved the chemistry between Ben and Rey\\, and how they represent the balance of the Force. They could have done so much more character development\\, and utilised Luke in a far better way. They also could have set up episode IX properly\\, but they didn't. It is just very deflating. I hold out hope for episode IX though. Help us JJ Abrams\\, you're our only hope.","true":true}
