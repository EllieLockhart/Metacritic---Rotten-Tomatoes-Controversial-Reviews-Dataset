Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ruins star Wars plain and simple I can talk forever about the flaws of this movie\\nRian Johnson ruined childhoods ruined escapism and ruined somes happiness\\nPlease go back to writing school","true":true}
