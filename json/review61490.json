The only thing that got this game points with me were the graphics. The controls were very much like the first game\\, but show their age. A little clunky at times\\, but alright. Now let's get to the big problem. The story. Jumping back and forth\\, from timeline to character; it was difficult to keep track of what was going on sometimes. But that was just the beginning. The characters were awful as well. Not the acting\\, to clarify\\, but the character writing. The characters from the first game made stupid choices that\\, if they were the same characters\\, they wouldn't have made. Abby\\, the new character\\, was completely unlikable and unrelateable\\, despite having a solid reason to be included in the story. The third problem is you can tell that there was an agenda\\, or another reason\\, the story was written and the characters made the way they were. Media\\, like games or movies or books\\, are made to enjoy and to escape reality. That all falls apart when someone is trying to shove their beliefs down your throat. This game is a prime example of this and explains why the story was so hard to follow. Too many agendas cause the story to be disjointed. It's such a shame\\, I've been waiting for the sequel since the first game was released on the ps3. It was a masterpiece of art. The main story\\, the dlc\\, graphics\\, it was incredible. Only to have the sequel reduced to someone's opinion on how the world should be. Please\\, let's return games to what they were and stop with the forcing of political and social beliefs. Those are some of the topics we are trying to escape when we play games.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
