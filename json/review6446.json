Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney turned one of the most beloved franchises of all time into a Conservative snuff film. It's all about female empowerment\\, the stupidity of men\\, the evil of capitalism\\, the cruelty of the rich\\, and how only poor people that come from nothing can be virtuous. You have ruined Star Wars for every generation just to push your own political agendas. Thanks.","true":true}
