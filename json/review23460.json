Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"LOVED The Last Jedi. Well done! If I was to divide the movie into 4 parts\\, I would give the first part an A\\, the second part a C\\, the third part an A+\\, and the 4th part an A+. Overall\\, I give it an A. The C is from the \\\"Casino\\\" scenes with Finn. Was way tooooo long\\, and could have accomplished what was needed for the story line without a lot of the extra stuff. Killed the momentum\\, but fully recovered for the 3rd and 4th parts of the film.","true":true}
