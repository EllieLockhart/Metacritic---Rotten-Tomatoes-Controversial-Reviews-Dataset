Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"WHAT I LIKED:\\n- good visuals\\n- great music\\n- the scene with the red guards\\n- Benicio Del Toro (minor) role\\n\\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:\\n- what they did to Luke\\n- Mary Poppins\/Peter Pan Leia\\n- Rose\\n- Canto bight scene\\n- sea cow milk\\n- Yoda burning books\\n- Rey is an instant Jedi\\n- terrible humor\\n- Chewbacca underused\\n- Luke's death\\n- Useless scenes\\n- Snoke - no backstory\\n- Rey's parentage\\n- Snoke's death scene\\n- shirtless Kylo Ren (why?)\\n- Poe becomes a useless hothead\\n- Finn goes on a pointless mission\\n- terrible dialogue\\n- some pretty bad acting\\n- questionable casting\\n- PREACHY AS HELL\\n\\nToo bad because this movie could have been awesome.","true":true}
