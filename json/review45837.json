Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very simple\\, this movie did not feel like star wars at all. Very poorly executed\\, the humor was atrocious\\, completely out of place ruined all serious moments. I could right a bible on how wrong and bad this movie was but I won't. Disney never allow Rian Johnson to direct another star wars movie ever\\, ever\\, again!","true":true}
