Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know what this is\\, but its not Star Wars.  I've been a fan for nearly 40 years and I went in eagerly looking forward to seeing what had become of Luke Skywalker following ROTJ.  I wish I hadn't bothered.  \\n\\nIt would be hard to create a duller\\, smaller\\, more malevolent movie than this garbage.  The tone (Hux! Ade Edmondson!) was all wrong right from the very start.  The plot-holes were absolutely unforgivable (hyperspace ship missiles\\, Yoda having real-world influence yet not using it at any point previously).  Familiar and well-loved characters were treated shamefully by the scriptwriters.  I've had enough now\\, they are doing nothing less than treating fans like fools who will continually pay good money for anything as  long as it says Star Wars.  Its box office returns were always going to be good\\, but they could have (should have!) been great!  I won't be paying to watch the next ones.","true":true}
