Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Abomination. Rian Johnson point blank said he likes to make movies that divide the fan base. Well - he succeeded. Terrible plot\\, betrayal of classic characters\\, and political brow beating can all be found aplenty here if you're into that sort of thing. The only redeeming qualities are Luke imitating the force with a leaf\\, and the freaking porgs.","true":true}
