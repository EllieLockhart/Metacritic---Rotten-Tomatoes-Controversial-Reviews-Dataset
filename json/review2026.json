Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As someone who is a long time fan of the deep lore behind Star Wars Universe\\, and thematic ties it weaves into its stories\\, I couldn't be more than disappointed with this movie and the franchise altogether. There was so much potential for them already laid out before them\\, and instead chose to ignore it. This movie felt more like a corporate cash grab than an artist expression of a fictional universe. I left the theater underwhelmed during The Force Awakens\\, I left The Last Jedi with a sickness in my gut. I guess what they say is true. Star Wars was just a series meant to sell toys to children and nothing more. As an older fan of the series I will move forwards by ignoring my nostalgia and spending my time watching productions that do not ignore their supporters. I truly hope this is The Last Star Wars they continue to ruin and bring more stories like Rogue One.","true":true}
