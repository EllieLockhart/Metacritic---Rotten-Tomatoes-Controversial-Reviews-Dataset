Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For old farts like me whose life has spanned the life of this franchise\\, this film really requires two viewings. I was initially very bothered by several things in the film. In some ways I felt the film betrayed some of the legacy of the franchise. In other ways I felt underwhelmed by what I view as lazy plot devices and cheap laughs.\\n\\nUpon a second viewing tonight\\, I get it now. Betraying the legacy is the point. If \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" stuck too close to the classic plot and Star Wars playbook\\, \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" seems destined to throw the playbook out the window. Kylo Ren says it himself: \\\"It's time for old things to die\\\". The Star Wars story is riddled with short term victories and colossal losses on both sides. For both sides to gain any meaningful ground\\, and for this story to progress beyond the original trilogy\\, the old things must die and a new playbook must be written.\\n\\nI'm still bothered a bit by the Deus Ex Machina at the end\\, but I understand better now why it was necessary. Luke was haunted by a legacy that had grown far beyond his capacity to deliver. And while he could never truly be what the galaxy had grown to expect and need from him\\, there was a way he could leverage that legacy to be the \\\"spark that lights the fire that burns the First Order down\\\".\\n\\nThis is definitely not your daddy's Star Wars. But maybe that's a good thing.","true":true}
