Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Completely ruined the franchise\\, worse than Jar Jar. It felt like I was watching an episode of Red Dwarf. Failed humor\\, ruined storylines\\, destroyed characters. I\u2019m now going to the dark side because I hope everyone else dies. The writer should retire and make a public apology to everyone.
