Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Laughable scenarios in which the writers have created in this movie. Horribly written and throws out all connections and questions brought up in Episode 7. It reeks of Abrams' style of 'storytelling'. Simple and weak.\\nRehashed some plotpoints from the Original Trilogy and just threw them in a blended and spewed it out all on screen. \\n\\nI hated the new characters introduced\\, and everyone was doing their own thing for themselves most of the time. There was no interest in helping each other or meaningful interactions. It was just bland story\\, selfish characters\\, and meaningless back stories.\\n\\nOne good thing about this movie is that it made me truly appreciate the prequels a lot more. At least those were more original stories.\\n\\nI see a lot of sheeple giving this high praise\\, but they clearly are blinded by fancy visuals.","true":true}
