Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One word: disappointed. I hyped myself up so much for it\\, and was let down. I feel as though Disney took the Marvel Cinematic Universe route and added too much levity. I was looking for so much\\, after having followed it up to this point\\, and found so little. Definitely awestruck moments\\, but definitely not the way I foresaw it happening. I have not read any of the bad press yet\\, but I am sure I concur with much of it.","true":true}
