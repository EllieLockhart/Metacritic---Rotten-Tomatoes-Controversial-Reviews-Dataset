The whole freaking 30 hours\\, yes. I'm also not going to spoil anything here\\, only talk about the overall experience.\r\rFirst\\, lets talk about those 30 hours. **** hell\\, this game is loooong. I swear to God\\, they could've easily made 2 games out of all the events and stuff that happens in this game. And absolutely nothing in it feels like \\\"filler\\\" content\\, the game just bombards you with action after action\\, twist after twist\\, it's insane. The game also has more locations and places to explore than I could've ever imagined\\, it's RIDICULOUS. Not ONE of them looks rushed or anything lesser than a masterpiece in terms of detail and visuals.\r\rTalking about visuals\\, HOLY **** You played Uncharted 4? Yeah\\, this game looks considerably better. I don't know how it's possible\\, but it's true. TLOU 2 has absolutely no right to look this good on a current gen console. The PS4 goes out with a bang with this game.\r\rSTORY. Oh\\, **** What the **** do i even say here... I close my eyes and I see scenes from the game. Play it. Do it and you'll understand. I'm kinda going through my adjectives here\\, I don't even know how to describe it. The game will take you on a ride and there's no getting off until you reach the end. It's history making kind of story. People will talk about it for years to come.\r\rI left one of the best parts for last... The gameplayyyyy. Visceral. **** Visceral. Absolutely ridiculous what they did here. No other game comes as close in terms of making your enemies feel ALIVE. Making your character feel alive while in combat. No game has did what TLOU 2 has done in terms of gameplay. EVER.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
