Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film had its issues\\, but overall I was very satisfied with how it played out. Rian Johnson had a goal to break away from the old conventions and push the series forward. I understand that some people were not happy with what happened\\, but it's time to let go of nostalgia and let a story be told. As with Empire almost 40 years ago\\, this will be a film that takes time to digest and reflect on.","true":true}
