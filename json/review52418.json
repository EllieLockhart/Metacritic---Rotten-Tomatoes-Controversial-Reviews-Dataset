Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A great movie but not a great Star Wars movie. A disappointing story line for Luke and if the were to write him out for the older fans they could have made it a bit more amazing.  The cast were good and it was very well directed but the story line jist left so much to be desired.","true":true}
