Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This abomination is an embarrassment to the Star Wars story.  The characters were completely inconsistent\\, the plot was a cheap re-write.  If it wouldnt hurt my local theater I would have asked for my money back.","true":true}
