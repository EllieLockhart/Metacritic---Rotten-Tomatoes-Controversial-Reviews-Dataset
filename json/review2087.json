Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"a steaming pile of garbage that only serves to assassinate beloved characters\\, replace them with lack luster characters in a poorly-contrived story full of plot holes and shove identity politics down the audiences throat. Rian Johnson will go down in history as the director who intentionally brought down a mighty franchise and divided its fan base.","true":true}
