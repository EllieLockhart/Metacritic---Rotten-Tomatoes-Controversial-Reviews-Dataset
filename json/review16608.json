Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Incredible movie. A movie which has all the thrills and spectacle you'd expect and yet has it's own sense of purpose within the Star Wars saga. It serves as a message to fans of the original films still holding on to the past\\, who're constantly seeking a recreation of what made the originals so great. The original trilogy cannot be touched and will always be there. It's now time to accept that times have changed. We need to let go of the past and the expectations that come with them in order to really create something new and special for the next generation. This film riskily and purposefully doesn't give fans exactly what they want or expect in terms of certain story choices\\, as a means of communicating to us that it's time to move the story and franchise as a whole in other directions. This will of course result in a lot of fans being upset and angered initially\\, however\\, upon repeated viewings I believe this film will become appreciated for ushering in a refreshing change to the overall Star Wars saga. It's cleverly done\\, with excellent set pieces\\, fantastic special effects and although purposefully different\\, still sprinkled with enough nostalgia to keep you happy. ","true":true}
