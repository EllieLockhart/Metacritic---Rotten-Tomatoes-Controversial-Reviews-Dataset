Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not sure why people are giving this movie 1 or 2 stars. Yes\\, it wasn't perfect\\, but it was very entertaining and many unexpected things occurred. My experience was phenomenal\\, with the audience applauding and cheering several times throughout the movie. I'm already excited for Episode IV and will be watching TLJ many times before the new release!","true":true}
