{"101487":105324,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As an avid SW fan\\, I am a little conflicted after my second viewing. (Spoilers) On it's own\\, this film is a fantastic\\, entertaining romp through the Star Wars galaxy. But stacked up against the greater themes and character arcs developed in IV\\, V\\, and VI -\u00a0as well as VII -\u00a0it creates a lot of confusion.\\n\\nI give them film 4\/5 stars. Yes\\, there are story developments that seem a tad contrived\\, such as Canto Bight or the Slow Space Chase\\, but in this review\\, I'm going to pass over any issues with logical plot development or space gravity weirdness\\, and I want to look just at the core themes of Star Wars\\, and whether or not this film hits the mark:\\n\\nNEVER MEET YOUR HEROES:\\nLike most\\, I was disappointed in not seeing Luke be the \\\"hero\\\" we all wanted him to be --\u00a0BUT this is the exact theme The Last Jedi is trying to explore. Luke is struggling with not living up to expectations\\, failing\\, being a bad teacher\\, disappointing his loved ones\\, and ultimately blaming himself for everything going wrong. So the disappointment shared by SW fandom is ultra meta\\, and once I have some more time to think about it\\, might actually be better than Luke being a kick-butt Jedi Master.\\n\\nYOU CAN SUCCEED BY PUNCHING HARDER?:\\nI am disappointed in the overall theme of \\\"use violence to solve conflict\\\" that Rey seems to be learning (and this film encourages). This differs greatly from the original trilogy: After three films worth of attempting to use violence and being overly self-reliant\\, Luke finally realizes in RotJ that he has to show love\\, and compassion and trust in a \\\"higher power\\\" i.e. the Force to triumph over evil - he can't simply use brute force to beat the Emperor\\, as it would make him just the same evil as his father Vader. This theme really resonates today\\, as many people who have experienced extreme injustice are taking it upon themselves to enact some kind of revenge. Bombings. Shootings. \\\"You hurt me\\, so I'm going to hurt you back.\\\" Spiritual themes\\, to be sure. But important ones that shouldn't be completely ignored. Surely Luke could have passed on what he learnt about this from Yoda? But this is almost entirely ignored - I say 'almost'\\, because technically\\, Luke's final stand is violence free. But he doesn't attempt to pass this teaching down to Rey when he has the chance.\\n\\nDON'T LOOK BACK?:\\nI enjoyed the strong theme developed in Last Jedi is about letting your past affect your present. \\\"Does your past define who you are now?\\\" Luke is hiding in fear of making big mistakes again\\, and fails to reveal his past mistakes to Rey. Rey is letting her upbringing and lack of parental direction stifle her growth. Kylo is allowing hatred of his upbringing define him\\, and hurt others. This theme is super complex\\, and ultimately unresolved\\, which was interesting\\, and look forward to IX to develop further.\\n\\nIN SUMMARY -\u00a0I really enjoyed Episode 8. I love that The Last Jedi introduces us to some new core themes completely separate from any other Star Wars film. And as a 'second act'\\, it's very okay that the film was confused\\, filled with failure. Hard to swallow\\, but our heroes might actually be failures sometimes too.\\n\\nBut I believe I will only be able to give The Last Jedi a proper rating once Episode 9 comes out. Because it's only in IX that the big themes of Star Wars can really see closure\\, and add definition to what we just saw.\\n\\nUltimately\\, I think deep down we all hope to see our galactic heroes truly meet the challenge of their internal struggles. Not just triumph over galactic evil\\, but triumph over themselves too. Give us each something to aspire to be. That's what Star Wars is all about\\, isn't it? At least it is for me :)","true":true}
