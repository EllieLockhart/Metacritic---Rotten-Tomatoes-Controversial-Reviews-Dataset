Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm 99% sure that Sara m\\, %20% 20Johnathan s\\, Eugene e\\, Sanjay %20 n\\, and Jeffery b are the same person (writing style is a give away not to mention the % in some of the names) trying to save the audience score.  The posts are only a few pages back.  Why stop at only 5 imposter posts in close succession?\\nDo yourself a favor if you hate this movie\\, get on a stationary bike\\, switch your TV to YouTube and watch MauLer's \\\"A critique of Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\\".  These videos should be watched by Disney\\, Lucas Film\\, Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson.  They are long videos but worth the viewing. \\nThe movie needs a complete reboot.  I'm really hoping the whole movie is a dream that Finn had while in a coma.  The movie has so many flaws that have been discussed at length by others so no need to rehash them all.  However\\, Yoda being able to impact the physical world by touching Luke  and summoning force lightning completely ruins everything.  Yoda and other force ghosts should just wipe out evil using force lightning so that the living don't need to risk their lives.  Terrible writing that was clearly not thought out at all.  I have no interest in any of the new upcoming movies\\, toys\\, or theme parks anymore when I was completely on board before this trash.","true":true}
