Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Underwhelming. Great fight scenes\\, special effects. Lackluster story. Keeps with the previous movies habit of not really doing the original characters justice or giving them a great send off. The new characters are meh\\, not to say the actors\/actresses are bad (I think they're good)\\, the characters they play are just...not interesting? Worst part about this movie is it takes a hero from the original trilogy\\, and shits on his memory. Go read the Timothy Zahn books. Way better.","true":true}
