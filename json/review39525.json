Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was a disservice to the Star Wars saga franchise\\, intended to tell the continuing tale of the Skywalkers as begun w\/ the Jedi Order discovering Shmi Skywalker and her special son Anakin. The films director\\, Rian Johnson and Dusney seem to have entirely mussed that point when they developed this entity which possesses no cohesion with pre-existing saga films and no coherency unto itself. The plot was a sieve of holes\\, and the characterization without devlopment or consistency with preestablished charcters. How this flaming garbage bin received the reviews from so called professional critics belies some sure malfeasance on the part of Disney\\, given the consistent audience downward trend here\\, anecdotally and in every comment section of EVERY posotively spun article the Disney manipulated entertainment press can poop out.  The biggest fault of this film is that it turns mutliple Star Wars universe points of logic and understanding of characters on their heads\\, such as hyperspace and most importantly the ethos of Luke Skywalker\\, hero redeemer in chief\\, whom the audience is expected to belive would abandon all of that in the face of one personal failure. Furthermore\\, the much agreed upon NEEDLESS side trip to. Anto Bight undercuts the basic premise of the films main storyline regarding hyperspace and chase of good guys by bad guys! Further\\, great characters such as Admiral Ackbar\\, Chewie\\, the OT droids\\, and even Finn are simply wasted garnishes for the favored meat of the Keylo romance\/hate match. The film even forces liberally biased politically messaging on feminsim at all costs\\, animal cruelty\\,  and corporate roles in war profiteering by esssentially asking characters to perform a Saturday morning look into the camera. Gone is the subtelty of Lucas's use of Ewoks as representing the Viet Kong and the Death Star as a worst case parallel to outlr own cold war MAD theory of war gone extreme. No\\, this movie was horrible\\, and has effectively caused me to turn away from Disney Star Wars\\, and Ive been a fan since 1995.
