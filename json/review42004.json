Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie made me a Star wars fan... because I could not believe what i watched at the end. i didn't give a damn about star wars\\, but i know how much it means to many people around the world\\, especially luke. and what they did to mark hamil in this movie is unforgivable. ruin johnson is a child that can't take criticism. watch the dvd extra and see that buffoon not listening to anybody but his giant round head. what a shame.","true":true}
