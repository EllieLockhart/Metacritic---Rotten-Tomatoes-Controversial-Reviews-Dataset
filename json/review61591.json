The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"As a game this is above average. The game always gives the feeling that the world is inhabitant and the places visited feel \\\"real\\\". The story on the other hand always feels surreal\\, character making decisions they wouldn't have in the world of the previous one. The world has been in this state for 24 years. By now only those that have learned to survive\\, to be decisive and to be viscous\\, to be conserving and to be cautious are left\\, they are \\\"the last of us\\\".\rIn this game Joel and Ellie have already found a place to call their home\\, where they do not have to cautious around everybody and can let their guard down\\, but they are still aware of the rest of the world and what it means to be out there as they have experienced it for most of their lives\\, yet they make decisions that even in their rage and blood lust seem more than out of place than ever before.\rThis game has made the commitment to deconstruct Joel as much as possible and telling the player how awful he is or was\\, ignoring the end of the previous game telling us to decide for our selves.\rIn this game Joel is not portrayed as father who cared about Ellie but as a father paranoid about what would happen to her if people found out about her immunity. In the first one Joel and Ellie chose to not talk about her \\\"condition\\\" and frankly were prob indifferent if people found out. There mindsets have changed just to give players the impression that Ellie is uncomfortable around Joel.\rThis very much is the point i am most disappointed about and the reason i am unhappy about this game. Joel was a monster and nobody denied it\\, but that was what he needed to be to survive and at the end of the day he was a monster so Ellie could live\\, but naughty dog changed it from a Father doing anything to save his daughter to a lunatic that killed the last hope of humanity and is a bad father. The only line they delivered perfectly was when Joel was faced by Ellie and he said he would do it all over again.\rThis score is for Joel.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
