Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Destroyed everything Star Wars stood for. This is not Star Wars\\, this is now a full blown Disney movie complete with SJW propaganda. The entire movie is one giant plot hole that throws everything built up in the OT\\, PT and EVEN TFA. I would actually forgive all of that if not for one thing. What they did to Luke Skywalker's character is unforgivable. Even Mark Hamill himself is insulted by it.\\n\\nRian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy have officially killed Star Wars as we know it. This is the new SJW Disney Wars. Shame on anyone that supports this blatant cash grab and assassination of the Star Wars lore.","true":true}
