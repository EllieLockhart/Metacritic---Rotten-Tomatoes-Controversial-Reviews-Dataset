Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This last jedi had nothing to do with the first one. All characters took out a concept\\, jokes wernt funny\\, the director obviously went on youtube to see what the audience will think will happen then did the opposite which is why the charaters were out of character. The director should be fired\\, Kathy should be demoted\\, & I thought JJ was gonna screw up Star Wars like he did Star Trek. George needs to participate more. It made a billion dollars but half of that billion is people who don't like it so their not going to buy it. As soon as Luke threw away the lightsaber I knew it was all down hill from there. People are just no longer impressed with special effects\\, it was actually Mark Hammill that made it all work. I think we should let Mark Hammill write the next one & direct it.","true":true}
