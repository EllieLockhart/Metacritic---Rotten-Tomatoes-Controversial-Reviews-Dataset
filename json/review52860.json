Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Amazing movie\\, great storyline with a perfect flow of humor\\, action and storytelling. You can understand why specialized media is praising the movie while people needing attention get low stars\\n\\nBut don't get for this ones\\, the movie is really great!","true":true}
