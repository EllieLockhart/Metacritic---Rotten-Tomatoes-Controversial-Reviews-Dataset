Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have no idea what people are complaining about. Yes\\, there are plot holes you can drive a bus through\\, nonsensical plot devices\\, poor character development and some truly daft moments leaving you wondering \u0093why didn\u0092t you do x 5 minutes ago\u0094. But show me a Star Wars film that didn\u0092t have all of that in spades? It was highly entertaining and a brilliant addition to the franchise. Just go see it and ignore the naysayers.","true":true}
