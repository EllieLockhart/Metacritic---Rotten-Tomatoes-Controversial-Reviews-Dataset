Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a long time fan since 1977\\, having watched all the movies in the series a gazilion times\\, I really enjoyed this last SW instance. It was very entertaining\\, visually stunning and full of surprises. Lots of opportunities to connect emotionally to characters and scenes. I don\u2019t quite understand the backslash from some reviewers as I consider this movie as one of the best in the series!","true":true}
