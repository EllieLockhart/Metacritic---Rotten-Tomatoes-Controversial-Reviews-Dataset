Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Never I have I been so disappointed in a movie. Everything fun about the original trilogy and the force awakens is thrown out the door or cast aside. It's 2.5 hours of trash and nothing happens in this movie. Save your money and check it out when it hits Redbox.","true":true}
