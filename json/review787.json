Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An entire movie about people running out of gas where the director\/writer decides luke drinking green milk is more important that developing the characters and showing luke's grief when learning about his friend Han. Nothing in this movie makes sense in the long term story of star wars and even if it stood alone it would be arguably one of the worst written star wars movies ever. Let's not even get to leia floating in space looking like a rubber figure.","true":true}
