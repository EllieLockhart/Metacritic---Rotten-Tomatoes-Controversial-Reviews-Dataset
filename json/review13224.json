Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I dont understand the 53% rating. This was really good! I liked finally getting exposition and backstory and learning just what in the hell is going on in the 40 years since the fall of the Empire. In 7 just a bunch of things happened - total fanboy pleaser. And I liked its unpredictability\\, like killing off Snoke...even though we still dont know much about him\\, like how he came into power and became supreme ruler of the first order after the Emporer died and the Empire fell.","true":true}
