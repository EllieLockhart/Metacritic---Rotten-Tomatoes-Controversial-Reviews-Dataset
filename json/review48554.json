Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"words cant honestly describe how frustrated\\, disgusted and downright disappointed i was with the way disney sold out a once beloved franchise to nothing but diversity quotas with no relevance to the overall story\\, a stupid \\\"evil rich white conservatives\\\" plot that made completely no sense. The worst part of the whole thing\\, and i mean the time where it got so bad i had to leave the theater and ask for my money back was when they made luke go out like a punk. i had that one glimmer of hope that when he was going to fight kylo ren that a fight resembling the one with yoda in episode 2 was going to happen but no. he just disappeared into the distance like a freaking joke.....if i could give this movie negative stars i would\\, but unfortunately that would offend the snowflakes","true":true}
