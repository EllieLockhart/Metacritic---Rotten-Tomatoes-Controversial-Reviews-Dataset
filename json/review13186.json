Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't think almost any of the characters acted their parts. Felt like a mishmash of jokes & too many plot twists shoved into the story\\, just so they could say they were put in there.  It created a jumbled story with tons of plot holes. And I felt all of the actors were way out of character. \\nOver all\\, its my second least favorite of the Star Wars films.","true":true}
