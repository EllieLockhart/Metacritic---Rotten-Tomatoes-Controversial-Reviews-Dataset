My reason behind this is that the gameplay was outstanding. The soundtrack was outstanding. The story not so much. First\\, I think that the way Joel died was not an honorable death for a character we were all so attached to. He deserved to die of old age or a natural cause rather than being beaten to death. Second\\, Abby. I find the idea for being able to play as the antagonist interesting but not a lot of people dig playing as the character who murdered a character we loved. When playing as her I felt that maybe it was only there to prolong game time. I think maybe little cutscenes from time to time would have been better. Third\\, the ending. Personally I was okay with Ellie not killing Abby. Only because it was supposed to show that Ellie still had a good side to her. The part of her she had when Joel was around. Although it did make me feel like that last few hours of the game were pointless. I think they should have just ended it at the point where Ellie had a home and family. I also hated the fact that when she returned home\\, everything and everyone she loved left her. Anyways that was my opinion on the game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
