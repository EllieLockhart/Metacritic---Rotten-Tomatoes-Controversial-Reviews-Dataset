Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is by far the worst Star Wars movie yet.  It has more plot holes then all the other movies combined\\, it treats old characters with unfair treatment and fails to develop the new characters enough to compensate\\, about half the movie is filler\\, and most of it acts as TFA never happen and the possibly as if any of the other movies never happened\\, it leaves subplots untouched and answers nothing\\, any thing E7 brought to the table is quickly squandered hear and forgotten\\, even if one was to look at this independent from all the other movies it still has to much plot holes\\, filler\\, and cliche\/unnecessary character that pull this movie below E2.  It ruined the characters\\, the lore\\, space battles\\, and brought nothing to the table\\, no interesting characters\\, no explanations...nothing.  One thing it did do was make me like Kylo Ren which i hated in the last movie but thats not enough to save this movie\\, the fact the this Ryan Johnson is getting his own trilogy is a testament to how much Disney does not care about this franchise.","true":true}
