Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was an alright movie\\, BUT for a Star Wars movie it was incredibly subpar. The universe is so vast from the EU\\, and the movie neither used any of that already filled lore nor expanded its own sort of universe. We received a sum total of three mildly important new characters\\, one died\\, one barely had any lines\\, and the other barely seemed like they should be there. Mark Hamil\\, himself\\, came out and said that he didn't understand his own character's drive or purpose. I understand that Disney and the guys making this new story want their own story and not the EU\\, but they're trying to continue a really deep and full universe without really expanding it. It seems like they're just riding the name of \\\"Star Wars\\\" and forgetting any of the two prior trilogies and televsion shows\\, the now official canon.","true":true}
