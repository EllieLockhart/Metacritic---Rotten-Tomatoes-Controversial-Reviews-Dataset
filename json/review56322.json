Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such an awesome movie.  So much packed into the hours of playtime.  I feel like the force is definitely with the new trilogy.  I'm a fan of every episide so far\\, and so much of the eu and the au which i hope lives forever in the imagination of excited readers.","true":true}
