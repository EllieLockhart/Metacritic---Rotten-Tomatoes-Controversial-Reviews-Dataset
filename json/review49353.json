Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst star wars movie yet\\,never going to believe the critics again.\\nTerrible story \\,terrible acting\\,just doesn't care about anything related to star wars. Its a big black hole\\,like a cheap TV rip off. Everything in the movie feels forced.Dont watch this\\,This will destroy star wars for you.Will not return to star wars unless they restart from episode 7 again.","true":true}
