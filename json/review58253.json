Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A baffling chapter in which the plot is predicated on two ships moving at such top speeds that the chasing one can't destroy the fleeing one\\, where an out-of-nowhere character assassination creates the only interesting part of the series\\, where the main bad guy is removed for no reason whatsoever with no explanation as to who he was\\, where a casino sidequest consumes 40 minutes of the film and yet has no impact on the progression of the plot whatsoever except for a hamfisted animal cruelty message\\, where the main cast runs for 2 hours and then realizes they can get in escape pods and leave but then get blown up anyway BUT one of them realizes they can just kamikaze the remaining warpship into the enemy ship and yet all of those people died while they sat concerned\\, where porgs are given near 20 minutes of screen time\\, where this is the best Star Wars since Empire Strikes Back.
