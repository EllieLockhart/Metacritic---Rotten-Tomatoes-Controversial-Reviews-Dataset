{"101487":133536,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-13","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hate Star Wars fans. Not the casual ones\\, the hardcore fanatics of this franchise of which I am one of. This makes others think all hardcore Star Wars fans are like this\\, giving some like me a bad name. They can never make up their mind on what they want\\, the prequels while bad\\, were complained as too different of a feel\\, which is true. Then The Force Awakens comes around\\, and everyone thinks it's too similar to A New Hope\\, and while it shares plot threads with that movie\\, it never takes away from the movie. Then comes The Last Jedi\\, which fanatics are now complaining is too different! Geesh\\, it isn't as radical in feel as the prequels\\, of which some are comparing this to. These hardcore fans never want to go to a movie and watch something they didn't expect. I mean as a Star Wars nerd and a film connoisseur\\, I can say that when I go into these Star Wars movies I want to see new characters\\, new settings\\, new conflict\\, I don't want everything to stay the same. While this movie is different\\, it helps separate it\\, these changes are good\\, the way this movie puts characters up against conflicts that we never expected is genius\\, and Rian Johnson must get more credit for what he did. More hardcore fans complain how Star Wars has been run through the \\\"Disney-machine\\\" and changed for the worse. People! Disney hasn't done a single thing to Star Wars that has taken away from the epic saga. The comedy in this movie is great\\, I laughed at almost all of the jokes\\, and I love how Star Wars is now introducing SMALL bits of other genres into the movies. If it weren't for Disney we wouldn't have these Star Wars movies! We'd be left with the bitter taste that was the Prequels. Some may argue George Lucas had started to develop a script for a seventh movie\\, but he only did that in a frantic rush to release episode seven\\, which probably would've been a mess\\, before he sold Lucasfilm to Disney.\\nNow for my thoughts on the movie. Wow! This movie is so unexpected I loved watching new things unfold in the Star Wars saga in this movie. Without spoiling anything\\, Rian Johnson does some incredible things with the characters he gives them these arcs that are incredibly fitting for their character\\, and each character is accomplishing something\\, developing the new characters and old characters alike\\, bringing truly heartfelt\\, brave\\, and heart-breaking scenes. This goes without saying but the acting is top-notch brilliance\\, with the stand-outs being Mark Hamill\\, Carrie Fisher\\, and Adam Driver. In terms of story this is excellent\\, everything involving Rey and her encounters while training are incredibly intriguing and the plot that follows Poe\\, General Leia and the rest of the Resistance is engaging and highly suspensful\\, as well as exciting. One of my two flaws with this movie was the part of the story that followed Finn and Rose's adventure to Canto Bight to find _____\\, this whole side-plot while still above-average just didn't seem all to interesting and almost unrelated to the goal that is trying to be reached\\, and it just pales in comparison to the other two plots. On the technical side everything is top-notch\\, as is to be expected. The CGI is amazing\\, and Snoke looks much more realistic. The camera work was brilliant giving us many breathtaking  wides of different settings\\, and the camera work stayed solid during battle and fight scenes as well. The cinematography is absolutely astounding and utilizes a lot of this film's unique look in terms of color for jaw-dropping and magnificent shots and sequences. The editing is also very good as well\\, notice how I said good. This is where my second flaw with this movie comes in; it's pacing. During much of the first act and some of the second things seem to slow down whenever we're with the Resistance\\, they're stuck in a sort of pickle and it requires slow suspense to do this justice. This\\, along with all the other plots adds up to a movie around 2 and a half hours long! Now the thing is\\, so much happens in this movie\\, not in a way that it feels cluttered such as The Amazing Spiderman 2\\, but these stories all are converging by the time we reach the film's climax. It would've taken away from the story if scenes were cut to reduce the run-time\\, so I really don't see how they could've improved it.\\n\\nOverall Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a bold\\, stunning\\, action-packed movie. With rich characters\\, excellent battle sequences\\, and a fresh and unique feel that adds to it's uniqueness\\, setting it apart from the other movies in the saga. The story for the characters feels so right\\, and to watch these characters face this is so satisfying as such a huge fan of Star Wars and it's amazing\\, complex characters. The stories\\, while they do lengthen the movie and stall the pacing at times\\, are for the most part grand and breath-taking\\, all adding up and delivering a final third act that feels well-deserved and anticipated. This movie was fantastic. I loved it. Remember that line from Luke in the 2nd trailer \\\"This is not going to go\\, the way you think!\\\"\\nScore: 9\/10\\, A-\\n\\nIn terms of where it ranks this is my opinion:\\n1. The Empire Strikes Back\\n2. A New Hope\\n3. The Last Jedi\\n4. The Force Awakens\\n5. Return of the Jedi\\n6. Rogue One\\n7. Revenge of the Sith\\n8. The Phantom Menace\\n9. Attack of the Clones\\n10. The Clone Wars (movie that most people rightly forgot even existed)","true":true}
