Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow...just finally watched the last jedi and I picked up on so many things that were off.  Thinking that I must've been overthinking it...I check out the reviews\\, and sure enough...the film was garbage and very obvious in it's attempts to cram liberal \/ feminist agenda down the audiences' throats.\\n\\nFirst\\, the objective review:\\n-Too many plot holes\\n-bad story\\n-unlikeable characters\\n-killed off too many main characters too fast\\n\\nSecond\\, the additional \\\"off-putting stuff\\\":\\n-Blatant replace-male-with-female just for the sake of doing so\\n-Coerces the partisan \/ SJW agenda on audiences (it's not hard to leave this crap out...really...it isn't)\\n-(After seeing the reviews) critics accusing fans of intentionally down voting rating\\, while not giving a thought to biased\\, agenda-driven critics of likely intentionally up voting the rating\\n-Cultural appropriation of another group's story (come up with your own creations...then you can cram all the non-sense you want into it)\\n\\nThe film was just genuinely bad.  The biased agenda context both in and surrounding the film just drags it down more.","true":true}
