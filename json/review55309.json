Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Life long Star Wars fan. Very disappointed with the story choices. It very much seemed the writers were making a deliberate choice to reboot the mythology of Star Wars\\, which is unacceptable. Star Wars mythology is set in stone. To remove it is to remove what makes Star Wars so much fun. Furthermore\\, there was also a deliberate effort to erase the plot points of The Force Awakens\\, which is again unacceptable. Putting those things aside\\, the acting and dialogue was a mixed bag. Some of the acting was very good\\, and some of it was cringe worthy (most of Lara Dern's character was hammy\\, and was Kelly Tran's). Also a lot of the plot didn't make logical sense. All together it was just plain bad. It wasn't so poorly dialogued and acted as the prequels\\, but overall it was worse than the prequels to the extent that it butchered the Star Wars universe in a way the prequels didn't. I normally see Star Wars movies 2-4 times in the theater. I will not be seeing this one again nor am I looking forward to buying it on home release.","true":true}
