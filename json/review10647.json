Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had so much potential but really a lot of pretty bad moves as far as where they\u2019re going with the story. Worst part was they ruined the amazing character of Luke Skywalker. Sad","true":true}
