Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As I sat back in the comfy leather seats and watched the star-dusted opening credits roll out in front of me\\, I reminisced about what it felt like watching the Star Wars series for the first time. It has been a long time since that happened and my only hope was that Star Wars: The Last Jedi would be just as mind-boggling as the others. Shame on me for ever doubting the legendary billion-dollar franchise\\, because (spoiler alert): It is!\\nIf you haven't seen the previous installment\\, Star Wars: The Force Awakens\\, then I highly recommend you grab some friends to watch it with and get yourself back on track. Otherwise\\, you will be in for a big surprise. For those who have seen it\\, then you know that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) makes an iconic return to the big screen and this time\\, with a vengeance. Luke went into hiding\\, undetected\\, to the Porg-infested island of Ahch-To to die. Rey (Daisy Ridley) has a mission to bring Luke back to fight the Resistance as war is once again brewing against the First Order. Millions of porg-encounters later\\, Rey finally persuades Luke to lend her his knowledge in combat\\, leaving Luke unsettled by the strength of her powers.\\nThis time around\\, Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern) leads the Resistance due to unforeseen circumstances. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and Holdo go head to head as he refuses to follow Holdo's rules. This creates major conflict in the storyline\\, as some things don't necessarily go as planned during combat. We are also introduced to a new lead character\\, Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran)\\, a maintenance worker that guards the escape pods. She bonds with Finn (John Boyega) as she takes him to her wealthy home of Canto Bight. Though\\, there's so much more to this planet than meets the eye.\\nKylo Ren (Adam Driver) remains high and mighty\\, just for show. It's evident that he hides something deep within\\, something he cannot control - a slight hint of compassion. After a head-to-head conflict with Rey and Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis)\\, the film finally reveals who he truly is.\\nNow that you have an idea of what the film is about\\, let's talk about the magic that goes on behind-the-scenes. To be quite honest\\, the writing has its lows. There are moments when the audience would let out an uncomfortable laugh due to the awkward\\, juvenile jokes that we know certain characters would never say or do. It felt somewhat out-of-touch with the Star Wars franchise\\, especially since they are thrown in during the most serious\\, suspenseful scenes.  Despite that\\, the rest of the screenplay is groundbreaking. It gives the audience what they want and what they didn't know they needed. Also\\, the cinematography is phenomenal. Shooting in locations such as Ireland and Croatia\\, the visual effects team make it seem as though they are off in a galaxy far\\, far away\\, without straying from its natural beauty. Special effects\\, as always\\, are mind-blowing. It's nearly impossible not to fathom lightsabers being real. Top it all off with detailed costume design and award-winning acting\\, and you've got yourself a masterpiece.\\nUltimately\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi exceeded far beyond my expectations\\, and I urge you to go out with your Jedi Knight robes and lightsabers and experience it on the big screen. I give it 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18 as well as adults. It opens December 15\\, 2017 in U.S. theaters so\\, go check it out. \\n\\nreviewed by michelle c.\\, kids first! fILM CRITIC. fOR MORE REVIEWS BY YOUTH\\, VISIT KIDSFIRST DOT ORG.","true":true}
