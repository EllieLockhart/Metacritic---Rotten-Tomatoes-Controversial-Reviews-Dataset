Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Here is what ruined it for me:\\nRose\\, why were even given this character? Useless! Like we were supposed to care years ago she was in that slave city\\, doesn't further the story but we had to be given that to go along with a stupid big dog chase scene which in the end was a waste of time! Rose was a useless character who knew Finn for 20mins\\, was a fangirl and oh now she loves him.  All the credit in the world to the scrip writer who allowed Rose to spit out the line\\, \\\"need a lift?\\\" HORRIBLE.\\n\\nDid we really need a close up shot of alien teets for milk? Stupid! Ancient alien caretakers to the island turned into comedic points\\, why?\\n\\nBut boy howdy did we really need BB-8 to give us a kid-friendly scene of shooting coins out of himself to stop a guard. BB-8 was better utilized in TFA and reduced to a comedic role this go around","true":true}
