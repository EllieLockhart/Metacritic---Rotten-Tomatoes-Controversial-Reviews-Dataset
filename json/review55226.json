Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just feel like Disney have missed a trick here. Characters that you don't really care about or were handled well\\, and characters that could have led a massive story arc get killed. I have to say that I thought Hamill was excellent. Not sure where Episode IX goes from here\\, but feels like the original trilogy is being killed off when it could neatly lead the future of Star Wars in to the future. Don't ruin it for a generation that gave Star Wars its life!!","true":true}
