Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An appalling movie\\, that betrays the fundamentals of the Star Wars franchise. The Shakespearean\\, poetic story narratives are gone\\, the powerful\\, otherworldly dialogue is replaced with Marvel-like humour\\, that is so bad that is completely destroys scenes. All the promising plot points set up in A New Hope 2.0 (The Force Awakens) have been decimated\\, and for what reason\\, well I guess only Rian Johnson knows... The whole film seems as if it exists\\, purely and solely to satisfy politically correct ideologies.","true":true}
