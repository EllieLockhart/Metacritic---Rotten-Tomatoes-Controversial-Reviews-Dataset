Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First gravity in space - need I say more. Next Leia flying and breathing in space with no character development prior to that moment to show jedi training\\, lazy much writers. Admiral Ackbar Leader of the Rebellion itself and tactical genius behind the Death Star 2 assault uncerimoniously removed with no mention when the bridge is destroyed and replaced with purple hair no name admiral because wamon. Hyperspace through snoke ship.... why not do that to the first two deathstars no need for ground assault or fighter battles and trench run. Rose saving Finn because physics dont apply to her. Luke not actually showing up to fight Kylo. Rey can do anything... with little to no training so what was the point of the jedi academies\\, training temples\\, etc.","true":true}
