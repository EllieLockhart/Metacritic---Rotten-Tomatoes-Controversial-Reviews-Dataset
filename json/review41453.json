Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a slap in the face for  real Star Wars fans! Regular \\nconsumers of Avengers and simular movies will like it as pure entertainment!\\nFor me it is by far the worst and disappointing movie of all films!\\nIt it also the end to high end replica merchandising but also for\\nregular toys and collectibles! Disney does not understand the marketing with this brand!\\nI hope they will finally admit and take Rian Johnson and this Kathleen Kennedy of the franchise and fire them!\\nIf Rian Johnson will really direct a whole trilogy\\,.. it will be a nightmare!","true":true}
