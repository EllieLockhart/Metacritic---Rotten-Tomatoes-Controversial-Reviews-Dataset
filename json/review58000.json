Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While Rian Johnson outdoes himself with his direction and other elements of production remain top-notch\\, The Last Jedi is filled with useless characters\\, unnecessary plot elements\\, and liberal undertones of politicization that greatly detract from the continuing of the Star Wars plot line. It's safe to say that Disney wrote some checks to the New York Times and Washington Post to maintain that 90% plus critic rating\\, which anyone who's seen the film knows is completely and totally undeserved.","true":true}
