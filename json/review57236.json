Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie does not work for me.  Too many plot holes.  Too many poor character choices.  Pool direction.  \\n\\nThe movie does have lots of eye popping visual candy for any audience but when it comes down to the myth and lore for the universe of story we have all grown to love known as Star Wars - it does it quite a dis-service.  \\n\\nWriter \/ Director Rian Johnson would have been best served walking the red carpet on opening night flipping all the Star Wars fans the bird and mooning them as he walked into the viewing.  When he went on to say he paid no attention to the Force Awakens when writing his next story - it showed the lack of respect for the story being told and more selfish implications of the new trilogy that he has been given (for now).  \\n\\nPerhaps Force Awakens write and director JJ Abrams can correct what has been done in the 3rd installment of this trilogy.  Help us JJ - you may be our \\\"Only hope\\\"\\n\\nNot saying you needed to follow what the star wars fans wanted but at least care about the star wars universe.  I would have run everything past George Lucas before going to film but what the heck do I know?","true":true}
