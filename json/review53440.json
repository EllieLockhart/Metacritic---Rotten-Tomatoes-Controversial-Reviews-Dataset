Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney Money Machine\\nCinematically\\, the movie was fabulous.  Plot and storyline\\, however was weak. Have to agree with Mark Hamill in that fundamentally everything about the Skywalkers\\, we disagree with Rian Johnson. So many plot holes.  Why build everything up in Force Awakens\\, when this movie just dismisses it as a joke?! I.e. Luke seees Rey for the first time with his old saber\\, the look he gives her\\, had so much emotional build up\\, to last Jedi\\, he tosses the saber over his shoulder like it was nothing? Snoke...what was the point of that character? No development\\, nothing..just a waste of space.Rey's heritage...she's a nobody according to Kylo REN...How does he know who she is? Is there a  galactic background check we don't know about? These 9 movies are canon because it was always about the Skywalker family saga\\, so hopefully there will be more story on this point.  Yes that shot of a boy using the force to grab a broom...anyone can have the potential to use the force...it was always that way...midi-chlorians.  The Jedi just identified them and scooped them up...Disney wants to highlight that so they can mass market it and make Money to pay for the franchise and their 2 big expensive parks. Kids will pester to go be a Jedi or force usersince it now can be anyone with the power and it opens up the horizon for more movies with Skywalker drama...that's alll fine and all\\, but don't forget the parents are the ones that have the money and we were the original Star Wars fans..let's tie up the original movies with proper plot lines and end the Skywalker saga with the respect it deserves.","true":true}
