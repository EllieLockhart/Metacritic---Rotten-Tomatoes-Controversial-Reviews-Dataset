Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only good thing about this movie is they brought back a character from the originals for one clip. Also\\, i guess the new creatures were cool too. No point to this plot. Left with even more questions than answers. Really wish they had followed the ideas the fans had for the plot. They literally followed a path that no one recommended. This was the worst star wars yet. True star wars fans can not be satisfied with this film. It was horrible. Don\u2019t bother going to see it. Maybe rent it on red box for $2 when it comes out.
