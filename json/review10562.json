Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great visuals and amazing sounddesign but the story couldn\u00b4t be more off and a director who should have let someone else do the story. Pacing is off as well. Jokes don\u00b4t work\\, plotholes everywhere..\\nGreat visuals can\u00b4t redeem a horrible screenplay. Might have brought the Star Wars Saga to an absolute down.","true":true}
