First all of the xbox fanboys just man up and shut up..go buy a ps4. This is far from the only title your missing out on. Second\\, those upset over Ellie being a lesbian its clear you are lonely and miserable exhibiting rage over a fictional characters sexual preference...its sad\\, pathetic really.

This is far from the only title your missing out on. Second\\, those upset over Ellie being a lesbian its clear you are lonely and miserable exhibiting rage over a fictional characters sexual preference...its sad\\, pathetic really. Keep in mind it is you who are the snowflakes. I'd like to thank Naughty Dog for a game which they clearly put their all into it. I'm only 9 hours in but felt compelled to put a review in due to the nonsense here on metacritic which is a display of ignorance. The graphics\\, story\\, dialogue\\, music and gameplay are exceptional and improve on what was excellence in the first game. The characters communicate throughout giving a better sense of who they are and where they've come from. Anybody who played the first and enjoyed it surely will love this game...of course that's said if your manhood isn't affected by the lesbian presence which is not at all shoved down the players throat as I've read in some of these small people's reviews. A narrow mind is laughable and also explains why many on here are lonely and probably miserable. I'm stunned in 2020 that you all made this \\\"political\\\"\\, but I'm not surprised. Anyway... this game is phenomenal and to buy into a snowflake narrative would be your loss if these opinions do in fact dissuade you from purchasing this game. Character development is top notch..and humanity is on display moreso than part 1. The story can be ugly\\, but aren't we. It is what people are and if you can't handle the brutality and emotion its not a title for you. The environments are steps above the original and the music sets the tone. Reactions in characters us the best gaming has to offer...as is the dialogue which is to say well written. Only 9 hours in and yeah\\, this is your game of the year. Thanks again Naughty Dog fir attention to detail in the form of broken glass crunching under Ellie's feet and setting the atmosphere with the proper gloom. I'm 100% satisfied. And Metacritic please get this problem fixed...these user scores are a joke.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
