Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely loved it ! Ok so the Leia scene was ridiculous and there were some big plot holes (like litteraly in every episode) BUT these are really minor mistakes in an overall great movie ! Loved the characters\\, the plot and the visual ! Finally some new ideas ! Already one of my favourite episode !","true":true}
