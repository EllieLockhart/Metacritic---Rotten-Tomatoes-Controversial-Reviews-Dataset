Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It wasn't completely awful but it feels like Star Wars list its soul. There were just too many things that didn't flow. Holdo keeping her secret plan of survival from Poe leading to a mutiny\\, the whole casino planet plot\\, in the Rey\\, Kylo ten battle with the guards one of the guards fighting Rey had two light saber the knives and then one disappears\\, etc. But the worst part for me is all the buildup from the force awakens was just totally thrown out and forgotten. No Knights of Ren at all!? WTF!?!? And Rey had virtually no training at all but I'd immediately a Jedi savant... And she has zero character development. She's basically just a Jedi Messiah type figure. This feels like a million missed opportunities. I'm surprised they even explained what happened with Luke and Kylo.","true":true}
