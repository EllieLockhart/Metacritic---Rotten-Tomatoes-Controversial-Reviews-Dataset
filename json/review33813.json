Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie\\, where do I begin. Luke Skywalker story arc is just laughable\\, this is the guy who wouldn't give up on his father and refused to believe he was all bad and wanted to turn him from the dark side\\, yet when when faced with the same dilemma with Kylo Ren (his nephew) he decides instead to hide away in an island to milk some alien cows?. The humour is misplaced and isn't funny\\, that opening scene with Poe Dameron in his X-wing joking with the commander of the imperial fleet is very much cringeworthy and sets the tone for the rest of the movie. Also PLEASE someone explain just why Kylo Ren is so dark-side obsessed? Anakin at least had a reason and was an awesome villain. Kylo just seems like a 13-year-old who got his black eyeliner taken away. What a lack of respect for the Star Wars universe. Leia flying in space was so bad. And BB8 driving was stupid. Snoke was the only good character but then he was killed. It was two and a half hours of pure Bantha poodoo and I'm being polite. Star Wars is dead.","true":true}
