Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honoring everything that made Star Wars wonderful and more\\, this film is exactly what the series needs--and everything a good movie needs.\\n\\nIt packs an emotional punch while reminding the audience of its characters' failures. It builds upon those failures and reminds the audience what makes those characters great in the first place. I'm not saying it will be without criticisms\\, but this film stays true to an authentic story as all great movies do\\, and will engender discussion about motives and plot in the best way. It's real\\, it's smart\\, and it's gorgeously shot and executed.","true":true}
