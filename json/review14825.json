Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have watched all of the movies\\, cartoons\\, played the games and read most of the books. This is not Star Wars. You left questions unanswered. I did not like the camera work\\, too many close up and mid range shots\\, as well as being underneath too often. The trilogies are supposed to be about the Skywalkers and if you are leaving us the the pitiful Kylo Ren I want nothing to do with this franchise. You could have expanded the universe outside of the trilogies. Rey means royalty and in the rest of the saga names of people and planets correlate to their historical meaning. Yet Disney tells us Rey is nobody. Why hire an actress that looks like an Amidala I am sure Lens-flare Abrams can come back and say he was messing with your head you are a Skywalker but I don't care. I could have overlooked the bad as I did in the others because it was Star Wars if you had not ruined Luke and made Rey a Skywalker. Aren't you supposed to leave us interested in seeing the next? I have no interest in seeing the next. To leave you with a turn of phrase from the other franchise Lens-flare ruined \\\"Live short and suffer\\\" Disney\\, Johnson and Lens-flare! I'm out.\\n\\nP.S. Dave Filoni should be writing these. His stories are the best thing Star Wars has going for it. I did think Mark Hamill and Daisy Ridley played their parts very well but I did not like their story.","true":true}
