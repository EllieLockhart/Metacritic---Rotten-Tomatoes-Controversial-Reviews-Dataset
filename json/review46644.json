Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Way too many scenes with forced humor and moments that are so ridiculous that they take you out of the movie. Totally wasted Lukes character. The silver lining is that this movie makes the prequels look great in comparison ","true":true}
