Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Atrocious movie. Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy have destroyed my love of Star Wars in 2 hours and 30 min. I had such high hopes too. The issue is Rian Johnson can't write a character. Characters don't change behavior on a dime. I saw an interview with Rian where he asked himself \\\"what's the greatest challenge each character can face\\\"? He failed to ask himself how each character would act in this situation. I can spit bile at this film for hours\\, but i'll spare the readers my hate. I will say that up until Sunday when I saw the film\\, I was most die hard Star Wars fan. Now I'm not sure if I'll ever see another Star Wars film. Rian\\, you ruined everything JJ set up for you. You clearly don't understand the fan base. You should recuse yourself from the trilogy Disney offered you. Clearly you don't belong in a galaxy far\\, far away.","true":true}
