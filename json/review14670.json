Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never been more angry and disappointed after seeing a movie. Terrible script that ruins characters that were my idols growing up. I have always loved star wars and this felt like a big middle finger. There is so many plot holes and this movie honestly breaks the lore of the entire franchise.","true":true}
