{"101487":176823,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-07-13","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie itself is pretty much different from other Star Wars movies which in itself is not a problem. It can bring in new viewers\\, it can introduce some new styles and features that can work and it does at some point\\, so that part is fine.\\nThe issues is actually with the basics. I think if you can keep 3 rules in check\\, then a film ina series of films in the same universe is great:1. Keep the rules of reality\\, 2. Keep the rules of the universe that the film is placed in. 3. Tell a good story with good characters. For these points Star Wars the last Jedi fails in every aspect. It does not hold the basic logic of reality like physics if the script demands it. It does not utilize the previously established rules and inventions in the Star Wars universe\\, instead it introduces a lot of new ones\\, which are totally idiotic and\/or not explained. Also some of these ruin the logic of the acts of the characters in the previous films as well. On the story side\\, it is a mess. We are jumping all around the places and times\\, usually it is not even clear what is happening after what in the different places we are watching and what is taking hours or days or weeks or just minutes. Characters act differently\\, they learn the same lessons as before or learn nothing\\, just suddenly act differently.\\nI think the main coincept behind the whole movie was to destroy what JJ built in the Force Awakens\\, so we tear down all the misteries that we had from the previous film (or simply forget them) while not establishing any new ones. Literally\\, I dont care about the next episode\\, because there is nothing to think about. Everything seems to be perfectly known and predictable as the movie ends.\\nWhy I am not giving it a complete zero is because the movie itself can be enjoyable. It is spectacular\\, many visually great scenes\\, but not much content behind it\\, at least for a Star Wars fan. It feels more like a Transformers movie.\\nAll in all\\, enjoyable\\, especially if you are not a big Star Wars geek\\, but otherwise forgetable.","true":true}
