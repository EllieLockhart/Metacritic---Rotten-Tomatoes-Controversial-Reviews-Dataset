Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The acting was good\\, and the cinematography phenomenal\\, but I just can't believe this script got the pass. The Last Jedi is an absolute train wreck and pretty much derailed the whole Disney trilogy and almost any chance of the story coming to a satisfying conclusion. \\n\\nThroughout watching this\\, it became clear that Disney had no through line for their trilogy and were basically passing around the episodes like a mad gab. How could they not have outlined the entire trilogy before filming any of them? Seems like a massive mistake which I'm sure they're kicking themselves now for. Filmmakers and studios\\, please learn from this disaster. If you're going to finish a saga and be the 8th film in a 9 film epic\\, you do have to think about all that came before and plan appropriately. \\n\\nIt seemed like Rian Johnson just totally went his own way and ignored all the potential setups offered by the Force Awakens. Which could work for a one off\\, but not something this tied to a story this big\\, with so much source material. And to have Luke Skywalker in a film after all these years\\, and not even participate in a real lightsaber battle is unforgivable. I understand the interesting choice to have him become a bitter hermit\\, but he does change by the end\\, and seeing him kick butt in real was such a missed opportunity. \\n\\nOverall\\, this is not a terrible movie\\, but I believe it is a terrible movie for this saga and doesn't seem to fit at all with the others. The Last Jedi made me not care about what happens next. And being a life long Star Wars fan\\, that is a huge feat.","true":true}
