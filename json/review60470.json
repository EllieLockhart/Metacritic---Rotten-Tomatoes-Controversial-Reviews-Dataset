Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Pacing was a little off but the story was great\\, Abby really didn't grow on me as much as the narrative intended her to but her set pieces did a fair job of humanizing her. Some decisions like lev suddenly leaving to get his mom or Jesse suddenly dying without being mourned felt a little off but the story maintained to be interesting enough to continue playing. Gameplay was on point\\, the mechanics from the previous game were improved upon greatly here. Seeing Ellie's growth or really her \\\"downfall\\\" was the biggest plus point for me\\, I really enjoyed playing as her and feeling what she was feeling and seeing how her sanity is tested throughout her story really showed something that other games haven't come close to displaying.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
