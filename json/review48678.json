Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst movie ever!  Disgrace to the Star Wars series.  Ignores all previous Star Wars history and destroys the character traits of legacy characters.  Major issues in the actual movie making process including massive holes in the script without explanation\\, bad comedy not in line with the Star Wars universe shoehorned into many area's.  One good thing I can say is the visual's were 1st class.  Easily the worst Star Wars\\,  I rank the Star Wars Xmas Episode as better than this - at least that story stayed with-in the Star Wars universe and stayed true to the characters.... and a better storyline too!","true":true}
