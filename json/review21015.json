Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wasn't really sure what was going on\\, it's a pretty movie that's really all it has going for it. The story is horribly disjointed and fails to really capture my interest. Hell my cousin fell asleep half way through. Easily the worst Star Wars movie. At least the prequels had a coherent and story.","true":true}
