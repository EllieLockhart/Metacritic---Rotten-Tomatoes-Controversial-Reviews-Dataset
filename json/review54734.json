Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Simply this is not a Star Wars anymore\\, this is a Marvel movie. Everything that make us love this saga during the years has been raped\\, like the epicness\\, replaced by empty sit-com jokes. Rey by Daisy Ridley (she could certainly spend more time in the gym before and during the filming) is more petulant and lackluster than the Anakin Skywalker played by Hayden Christensen in Clone Wars. The component radical-chic is more obvious then Star Trek Discovery or The Desolation of Smaug... nothing\\, nothing can be saved from this! Except the remarkable goal to be a movie that succeeds in the impossible! make us regret Jar Jar Binks.","true":true}
