Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is to The Force Awakens what The Empire Strikes Back was to Star Wars. This is a smart movie with great character development. This restored my faith in Star Wars movies. Where the Force Awakens was riddled with the same plot line as the original Star Wars\\, The Last Jedi went in new directions and the director was not afraid of showing characters that had flaws. I love that bits of humor were inserted into the film and Mark Hamill's performance was superb.","true":true}
