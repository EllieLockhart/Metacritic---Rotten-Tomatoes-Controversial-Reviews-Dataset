The story is much more grand in scale comparitively to the firstFirst off realise that PO'd fanboys are posting the same 0-3 reviews multiple times when it's clear that some of them haven't even played the game or don't know what actually happens. Also it's a game and even if you don't like the story the gameplay is amazing. TLOUP2 is an immensly dense game both in gameplay and story. The story is much more grand in scale comparitively to the first game which told a relatively simple story. This story examines the importance of those choices made in the first game and further examines the impact of a post apocalyptic world where murder and brutality is needed in order to survive. Here the story not only focuses on 2 individuals but looks at how these choices and circumstances effect everyone around our main characters. It's by far the most ambitious and satisfying game I've ever played. Now\\, some people obviously don't like the game and from what I've noticed is that people don't like it for one of two reasons: A. They feel the game Is pushing some sort of political agenda on them that they don't agree with. B. They're expectations of what the story should be do not match what the story actually is. Realize that this story does include LGBTQ characters\\, if you don't like that then this game probably isn't for you. I don't feel as though they were pushing an agenda these characters are there and they exist but there's not some grand message as far as they're orientations are concerned. They just are. Also Ellie liked girls in the first game so that shouldn't be a surprise re: Left Behind. Accept that what you want for the characters\\, and choices that you want to make are not what's going to happen because you are not them and they are not you. Drop all expectations of what the story will be and just let it happen and take in what it has to offer. These characters are not the same as the first game. 4 years have passed. They've changed\\, they've grown and they're going through something new. I loved this game. Is it the story I would've told? Probably not\\, but the story I would've told probably would've been boring and predictable. I appreciate that everytime I thought I knew what was going to happen next I was wrong. The characters made some choices I liked and they made some I didn't like but we're different people and we've been through different **** and we feel different things. Lastly it's just a game lol. Some people are acting as if their life is over.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
