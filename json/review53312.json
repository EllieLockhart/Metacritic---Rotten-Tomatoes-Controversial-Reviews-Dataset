Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Couch Potato Critic Review (spoiler free)\\nSTAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI\\n\\nI am understanding why the fan score for The Last Jedi is a lowly 58 on rotten Tomatoes.\\n\\nI was utterly frustrated by some of the things Rian did. He constantly interrupted the actual story to go off on these little plot vignettes\\, including the ending\\, which felt more like a not right for Star Wars Marvel bonus ending\\, or like the Mean Joe Green Coke ad from the 70's. I was sitting there asking myself\\, \\\"What the fuck was that? Did someone splice that in as a joke?\\\" I am not spoiling it by saying that\\, as every film has a fucking ending\\, and I am as ambiguous as I can be. \\nMy whole problem is this\\, the film's story and ending felt disjointed and anticlimactic.\\n\\nI now get some of Mark Hamill's warnings and comments.\\n\\nExcluding the prequels\\, I haven't disliked a Luke Skywalker related Star Wars film this much since 1983. Like Return of the Jedi\\, this film is chock full of bad ideas and weak storytelling. I will be reviewing it more thoroughly later\\, after my second viewing tonight. I am hoping seeing it again\\, will change my feelings. Doubt it\\, but\\, well\\, I love Star Wars and feel I need to try.\\n\\nLook\\, Like Return of the Jedi\\, it was still a fun film\\, but\\, it was completely sub-par to what the critics are raving about\\, making me ask\\, \\\"Did IQs just drop sharply while I was away?\\\"\\n\\nThe Last Jedi gets just 3 out of 5 potatoes.","true":true}
