Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the worst Star Wars movie since Attack of the Clones.  I know that sounds harsh\\, but it's true.   It was two and a half hours of plot holes\\, poor acting\\, and ridiculous premises.  Topped off with turning a cherished childhood hero\\, Luke Skywalker\\,  into a character of the uncle no one wants to invite to Christmas dinner any more.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi was utter and COMPLETE garbage.","true":true}
