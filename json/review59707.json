As a queer woman\\, the representation didn\u2019t bother me in the slightest and if anything I embraced it.

But that is absolutely not what the vast majority of us are upset about\\, it\u2019s everything else. The only moments that I was genuinely invested in were the flashbacks\\, and I do think that\u2019s all the game needed to be\\, not this new revenge plot. It just feels like they were trying to turn The Last of Us into something it just wasn\u2019t\\, and they strayed so far away from everything that made us love the first game.I went into this game with completely open eyes. I didn\u2019t see a single spoiler\\, thought the people who had seen the spoilers were overreacting and needed more context\\, was keeping a completely open mind\\, and had this blind faith in Naughty Dog because I genuinely believed that this would be the last studio that would screw up a story. I\u2019m just completely devastated because of what could have been. Through the game you could see moments of it\\, but they\u2019re the subplots\\, not the main one. The only character I felt invested in or even just found interesting was Dina\\, and personally I just couldn\u2019t get enough of her. But as someone who grew up with Ellie\\, was a similar age and really just related to Ellie\\, the fact that she wasn\u2019t on the forefront of my mind throughout this game was a big miss\\, and it just feels like to me that they butchered her character for the sake of a message. On top of that\\, it felt like they were trying to hard to compare (insert name here)\u2018s story to Ellie\u2019s\\, and it just didn\u2019t feel natural. Whilst I could see what they were going for\\, they just couldn\u2019t pull it together\\, with an ending that just made me ask the question \u2018what were they trying to do here ?\u2019My only hope for the future is that Naughty Dog can learn from this\\, because I honestly think it\u2019d kill me to see this happen to Uncharted\\, another series I love so freaking much. The main problem they need to learn from in my opinion is that you can\u2019t build a story around a message you want to convey\\, it\u2019s the other way around. I\u2019m still going to support them because this (for me\\, at least) will be the only blip on their record of fantastic games\\, and I do really look forward to seeing the stories of Chloe\\, Sam\\, Nadine and even Sully continue on. I do\\, however\\, think they need to leave The Last of Us alone for the sake of their fans. TL;DR: The Last of Us: Part 2 gives me the same feeling as season 8 of Game of Thrones all over again. Everything about it is perfection EXCEPT the story\\, which given the fact it\u2019s a Naughty Dog game of all studios\\, shouldn\u2019t be the case. And like season 8 of Game of Thrones\\, part of me wants to just forget it existed in order to restore the legacy of the original seasons\/story\u2026 Expand","true":true}
