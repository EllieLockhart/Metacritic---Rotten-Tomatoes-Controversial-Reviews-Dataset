Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Another epic Star Wars. Better than SW 7 for sure. Mark Hamill finally got the role he deserved as Skywalker. There were disappointments in the choices that the script writers made (\\\"that was lame\\\"\\, \\\"no way he didn't know that\\\"\\, etc) hence I remove half a point. But the movie had multiple very engaging sequences and plot twists. It was well worth the 3D dine-in theater ticket and the anticipation. :)","true":true}
