Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A lot of scenes were ruined by the 'marvel comedic style in the film. Moments that were supposed to look special and make you feel emotional\\, I found myself going \\\"oh for f*** sake\\\". Poor writing and there were scenes that should not of been in the final cut. Overall if you liked the force awakens\\, you will have a higher likelihood of liking this.","true":true}
