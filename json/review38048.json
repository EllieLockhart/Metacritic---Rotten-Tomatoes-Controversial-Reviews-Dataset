Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The story felt rushed\\, there were parts that were just plain goofy (like the AWFUL flying Leia scene)\\, and it just felt overall unremarkable. I wish they could take this movie back to the studio to do it over\\, but alas\\, this extremely unlikely. There WERE parts that were very cool\\, visually stunning\\, and thrilling\\, but overall I think the movie left me feeling dissatisfied.","true":true}
