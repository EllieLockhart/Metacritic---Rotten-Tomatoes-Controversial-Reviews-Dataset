Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a Truly crappy movie! Horrible storytelling and it makes TFA pointless as hell! Save your money this move blows! First Star Wars Movie I won't be seeing again. \\nRian Johnson needs to be fired. Johnson ruined two movies... Crazy he still has a job. R.I.P. StarWars","true":true}
