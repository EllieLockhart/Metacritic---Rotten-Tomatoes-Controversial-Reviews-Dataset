Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film wasn't just the worst Star Wars episode\\, it's a terrible film. A terrible story poorly told. If you like this movie\\, you've either got an incredibly low bar for what you'd consider watchable or you're so unsophisticated\\, you can't tell the difference between Star Ship Troopers and The Shawshank redemption. Don't watch this movie. Don't reward Disney for this atrocity.","true":true}
