Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Gut wrenching. I want to throw up every time i think about this movie. Disney just wants to make money and in doing so has forgot to make a star wars movie. They have now decided to change all of the characters' personalities. LUKE DID NOT NEED TO DIE. Even if he was to die\\, it should not been for NO EXPLAINED REASON. He should have at least died in an honorable fight. Also Leia's character was all wrong. she should of died instead of having a HUGE CRINGE moment when she floated through space! Rian Johnson\\, you should feel ashamed of yourself for taking one of the best movie series in history and driving it pointlessly into the ground.","true":true}
