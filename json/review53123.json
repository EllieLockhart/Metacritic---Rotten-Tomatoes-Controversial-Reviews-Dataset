Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A very disappointing movie experience.\\nThis movie is way to silly. Remember those cute BB-8 moments from Episode 7? \\nYou have one of those every 30 seconds.\\nAlso there are dozens of cute animals with big eyes servering as this movie's Jar Jar Binks.\\n\\nThe CGI was very obvious and distracting this time around\\, indicating that the previous movie's approach of doing practical effects whenever possible was left behind.\\nThis makes the movie feel much more like a Transformers movie than a genuine Star Wars experience. \\n\\nAnd the action also has a lot of meaningless action eye candy that would make Mr. Bay proud.\\nBarely any action scene was built up to\\, so you could be invested.\\nThey just happened to have stuff blow up and people shoot.\\nAnd they are flawed by making little to no sense in the events happening during them.\\n\\nBut the worst part was the story.\\nNot the core elements that are supposed to build a bridge between Episode 7 and 9\\, but what this director has done to the characters.\\n\\nSeveral characters are wasted with meaningless deaths\\, that had no real build-up.\\nSo much potential was wasted\\, just for some quick and cheap shock moments.\\nSo many developments\\, situations and solutions make no sense and are the cheapest of plot devices. \\n\\nThe actors were made to say the stupidest things\\, while receiving very sub-optimal directing.\\nThere are so many cheesy\\, generic and cringy moments and lines\\, it makes Episode 1 look like a very serious and dark movie.\\n\\nThe overall tone and style of \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" was nothing less than the Ghostbusters 2016 of Star Wars.\\n\\nIt's the weakest of the nine main Star Wars movies. \\nIt's not written or directed like a Star Wars movie\\, it wasted characters\\, it wasted potential\\, it made a mind- and senseless summer blockbuster giggle-movie out of this\\, it destroyed all the things that were built up in Episode 7\\, and it created the very hard task of salvaging this trilogy in episode 9.\\n\\nIt is a movie made without foresight and for the sake of contrarianism. \\nEverything that people were afraid of when they first heard that Disney bought the Star Wars license happened here.","true":true}
