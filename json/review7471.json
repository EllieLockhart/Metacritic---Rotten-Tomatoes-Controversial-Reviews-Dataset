Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Even though the storyline of The Last Jedi is intriguing\\, the movie fell flat. Finn's character devoplment went backwards when compared to The Force Awakens. Rose\\, who I assume is supposed to be a strong\\, independent woman\\, was poorly written due to the cliche of her sacrificing \\\"for the things [she] loves.\\\" The chemistry between the two characters and the plot in which they were written (especially that of the Casino scene) is why this movie horrible failed for the audience.","true":true}
