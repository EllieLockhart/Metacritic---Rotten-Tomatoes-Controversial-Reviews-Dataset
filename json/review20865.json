Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was about to give up on the Star Wars franchise after 'the Force Awakens'... It seemed like they were just pandering to nostalgia and had no new ideas or ambitions with this trilogy. I was pleasantly surprised to see 'the Last Jedi' take new directions and I'm sad to hear that 'the Rise of Skywalker' may retcon some of this. I enjoyed this film\\, the characters could still come a ways\\, I don't feel too strongly connected with anyone in this series.","true":true}
