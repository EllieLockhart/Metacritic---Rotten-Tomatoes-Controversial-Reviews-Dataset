Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"***MILD SPOILERS AHEAD***\\nThe Last Jedi was very good. People come out disappointed because their expectations weren't met - Rey's parents\\, Luke's characterisation (TLJ *is* 30 years after RotJ)\\, Snoke\\, etc. - but how boring would it have been to just have the same old good vs. evil? \\n\\nWhat we get instead with TLJ is complexity and shades of grey and a lot of character development. Some other reviews are pointing out how there is little plot. This is true to a certain extent - little action happens and the whole movie takes place over a relatively small amount of time - but the plot *is* the character development. We learn who these characters are - who they are as *people* - and they feel real. None of the characters are infallible; they make mistakes\\, they don't trust people when they should\\, are too trusting. They suffer and other people suffer because of it.  In the end\\, the characters all learn something about themselves and their flaws. I'm interested to see how the characters are impacted by their experiences and what it means for Episode IX.\\nThe Last Jedi feels less fantastical\\, is less black and white and gives the audience reality - about people\\, about war and its casualties\\, about the nature of morality and its ambiguity. It also gives the audience moments of levity to balance this out\\, which are fairly well-handled. Myself and others in my audience laughed out loud in places\\, which doesn't often happen to me in movie theatres. \\nFinally\\, the acting was very good - particularly Adam Driver as Kylo Ren - all of the actors did a great job of showing the conflict within their characters. The movie was also very beautiful\\, both the environments and the way that it was shot. \\n\\nThe way I would sum this up is that The Last Jedi is refreshing and complex. It is different to the original trilogy\\, but not in a bad way as some people are making it out to be. It is not a perfect movie\\, but I would say it is well worth a watch and fits in well with the Star Wars universe.","true":true}
