Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A very enjoyable entry into the Star Wars Franchise. I saw this twice in the theaters\\, and again recently. The film may have many small flaws\\, but I think that as a whole\\, it is very enjoyable and did a great job with all of the characters\\, especially Kylo\\, and Rey. I am excited to see how this trilogy ends\\, and I think this was a pretty good middle chapter in it. ","true":true}
