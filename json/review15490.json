Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it. Loved how it wasn't like ESB but was a Star Wars film. I loved how it was different and they took chances. The Skywalker complaining makes no sense when Obi and Yoda both ran and hid....Did not care for the Casino parts though.","true":true}
