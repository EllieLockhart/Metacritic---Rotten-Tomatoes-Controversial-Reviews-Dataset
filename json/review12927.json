Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I diged it. The movie looks gorgeous\\, the new stuff\\, the passing of the batton theme through out the movie and the main characters arch and journey works\\, but SOME characters are misstreated during the 1st and 2nd act in my opinion\\, giving no levity to their final state in this movie. There are some \\\"Ah!\\\" moments that will get recorded forever in your mind. The humor mostly works and the narative gets stupid at times. Overall I liked the movie\\, I don't love it but it is a very important film on the franchise.","true":true}
