Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"rotten tomatoes removed my last review - they probably thought i was a bot.\\ni created this IMDB account for one purpose only: to give this movie a terrible rating because i've never been so disappointed by a movie with the possible exception of avatar by m night shyamalan.","true":true}
