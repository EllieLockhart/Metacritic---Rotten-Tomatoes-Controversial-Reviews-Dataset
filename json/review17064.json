Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed the Last Jedi. It's easily one the best\\, if not the best\\, Star Wars films. Firstly\\, the characters are great and they all go on interesting journeys throughout the film. Secondly\\, the story actually focuses on the characters instead of surprises and has an interesting message about the force being for everyone not just a few select dynasties. Lastly\\, the humour was great which seems to have upset some people.","true":true}
