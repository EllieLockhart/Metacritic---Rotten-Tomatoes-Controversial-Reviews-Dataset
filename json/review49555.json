Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow.  I wanted to badly to like this movie\\, but what a complete piece of junk.  It's all been said here before so I'll be brief and will not provide spoilers.  But the movie is a complete mess.  Plot holes everywhere.  Unsatisfying character arcs.  And horrible mistreatment of the classic characters.  An abomination.  If you are a true SW fan do not see this film.  Do not buy the Blu-ray.  Save your hard earned $$ and go watch Rouge One or Force Awakens again instead.  In my mind\\, the saga ends with Force Awakens.","true":true}
