Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really didn't like this film. \\n\\nThe first hour meanders along with less story than a Smurfs film and a lot less charm. \\n\\nThen we find that the film disparages on the laws of the Jedi universe and allows flying through space\\, interactive 3D farsight and to top it all the killing of the major baddie in the most inept and inexplicable way possible. \\n\\nThe use of one of the most loved characters and his subsequent utterly meaningless death is something I am still trying to forget.\\n\\nI watched Force Awakens three times at the cinema\\, I'll never watch Last Jedi again. Ruined the story\\, had no real continuity to the saga and left us all with a really bad feeling about it. \\n\\nHell they didn't even say that!!!","true":true}
