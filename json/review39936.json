Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is easily the best 'Star Wars' movie since 'The Empire Strikes Back.' There is one moment -- and you'll know it when it happens -- that is one of the most stunning things you'll ever see in theaters. This is how we must say good-bye to Carrie Fisher on-screen\\, and Rian Johnson sends her off with grace and a bit of poetry\\, which is in short supply these days. This is also Mark Hamill's most satisfying turn as Luke Skywalker. 'The Last Jedi' is exhilarating\\, beautifully shot\\, and still somehow manages to surprise audiences. If you're an emotional type\\, bring tissues. The Force is strong in Rian Johnson... let's hope he comes back for more.","true":true}
