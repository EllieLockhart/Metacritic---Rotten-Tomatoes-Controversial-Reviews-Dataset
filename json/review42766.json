Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was horrifying. All the buildup to Rey's parents and we discover they were just nobody's\\nThen they off Skywalker when Carrie Fisher is dead. Like why go to all the trouble and have her float back into the ship ice cold? That whole scene was ridiculous.\\nAnd don't get me started on the Skywalker projection. Wtf even was that? This movie was truly a disappointment.","true":true}
