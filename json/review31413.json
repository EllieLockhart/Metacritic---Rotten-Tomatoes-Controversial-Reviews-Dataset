Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some of the best dialogue and character-driven drama in the entire series. The action is fantastic\\, and the Marvel-esque battle in the throne room felt new and fresh. Numerous \\\"holy s*** moments.\\\" Finn's plot line dragged badly and lacked payoff\\, and flying Leia was goofy. The good outweighed the bad though: serious twists\\, great acting (Adam Driver\\, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher were all highlights)\\, and great risks by Rian Johnson added up to a satisfying and fascinating experience.","true":true}
