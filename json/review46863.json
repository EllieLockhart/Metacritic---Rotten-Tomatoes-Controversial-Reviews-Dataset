Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well this was horrendous.  Some cool practical effects followed by nonsensical story and useless characters.  Two of the Hero's cause the deaths of the rebellion.  Kill off useful characters and keep around one who is no longer with us.  Seemed like every other scene was an F U to JJ Abrams or Lucas.","true":true}
