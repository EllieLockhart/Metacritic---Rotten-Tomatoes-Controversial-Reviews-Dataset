Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No idea where the vitriol for this movie is coming from. The only thing I can think of is some fans are mad their theories didn\u2019t materialize. There were some cheesy parts\\, but come on this is Star Wars\\, but the movie was awesome and I loved the unexpected plot twists. Definitely one of the best in the series.","true":true}
