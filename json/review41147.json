Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has been out for a full year\\, and has zero approved quotes on RT. Terrible plot holes\\, a complete disregard for 30 years of Star Wars fandom\\, and a lack of any true story continuity as they attempt to switch to a woefully unprepared director. Forcefeeds social justice themes into scenes where they only take away from an already poweful message. Characters break their own plot and momentum. \\n\\nA travesty only buoyed by \\\"critcs\\\" assuming that hardcore fans would love it\\, when they are the ones punished most by this abomination.","true":true}
