Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went in to the theater to watch this movie from an objective standpoint and with an open mind. Neglecting that I am a huge fan of Star Wars\\, I truly tried to view this movie as a cinematic experience separate from what I was familiar with. And even with all of that\\, this movie was absolute garbage. I made a profile on rotten tomatoes because I hated this movie so much I felt I needed to write a lengthy review about this dumpster fire. Anyone who enjoyed this movie has no cinematic taste nor a love for Star Wars. I hated this movie more thank I hated Jar Jar Binks.","true":true}
