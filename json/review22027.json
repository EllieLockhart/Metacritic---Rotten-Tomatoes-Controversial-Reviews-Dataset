Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just watched it.  \\n\\nFelt extremely sad that a legendary hero in a paramount haul mark movie is poo'ed on.  \\n\\nWhat's more\\, worldwide fans who grew up with the original movies are also are poo'ed on.  Disney is saying\\, your feeling and views do not matter\\, we have cash and brought the licence. \\n\\nI do not like the new trilogy from Lucas\\, but this movie made me wished that he stayed on directing the movie. \\n\\nMistake for \\\"STAR WARS\\\" brand by killing Hans\\, then now Luke in such inconsiderate way cannot be made\\, but is now made. \\n\\nAlso\\, Rotten Tomatoes' review is not always correct. But how did it give 91%!!!  Do they not have reviewer who grew up loving Star Wars?","true":true}
