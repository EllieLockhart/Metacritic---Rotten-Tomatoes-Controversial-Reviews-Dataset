Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After first screening\\, I loved it but have numerous questions.  Due to it's length and density\\, I have no doubt it will be a rich second viewing.  You went for it Rian Johnson\\, took great risks\\, almost too much\\, but created a fantastic addition to the Star Wars universe!!  A life-long fan thanks you...","true":true}
