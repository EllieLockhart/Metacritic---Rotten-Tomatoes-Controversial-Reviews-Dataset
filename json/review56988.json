Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They are running true cannon! Skywalker bloodline ends with 1 move? They make Luke\\, who is a beacon of hope look horrible! They massacred the beloved Luke! Rey supposedly becomes grandmaster of everything with 3 lessons? Ahh what? She can duel with the best of them after 3 lessons? Biggest baddest omnipotent villain with most power dies with the worst death ever created in the franchise! Leia can fly in space after being blown up? She has powers too now? Since when? Rey should have more training! Again\\, Rey...should have more training! A LOT more! It's just bad\\, such a bad cannon! Disaster what they did to Luke! Fire this writer and director now! We need a petition to fire these guys!","true":true}
