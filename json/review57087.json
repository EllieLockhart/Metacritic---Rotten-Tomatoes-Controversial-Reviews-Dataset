Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This  has to be the worst Star wars movie . First of all it seems like everyone who worked on the film is not familiar or has not taken the time to really appreciate what star wars is all about . The movie has massive plot holes and doesn't seem to know where the saga left off in the last film \\, I mean how does the  first order get so massive after just being decimated by the republic ? And how does the republic not help Lea and her group \\, they clearly had communication with the out side world . There is a lot of things that are wrong but godamnit why did you make Luke so unLuke like \\, Luke the guy who found good in the most evil villain in the star wars franchise tries to kill his nephew like WTF . I hate you Disney and Rian \\, you have alieneted the fans that supported the franchise all this while and for what ? \\, Branch diverse \\, feminine and progressive ? You have killed Star wars \\, I just hoped you wouldn't spoil Luke for us like you did Han Solo.","true":true}
