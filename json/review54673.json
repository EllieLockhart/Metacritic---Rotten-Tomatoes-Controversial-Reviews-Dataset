Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to love this movie\\, but left the theatre really disappointed.  I had mixed views on TFA\\, and was excited to see a new directors take on the Star Wars universe.  Maybe I'm just too old now for Star Wars\\, and my love of the original trilogy is just nostalgia.  Too many weird character choices\\, strange plot points\\, and the general feeling that this trilogy is not taking us anywhere new.  A group of good people (rebellion\/resistance) must fight against an evil (empire\/new order) to create a good new republic.  We already saw this happen\\, didn't we?  Maybe build off the original trilogy and tell a new story.  If you're going to tell a similar story again\\, at least make it good. This could be a gut reaction - if it grows on me\\, ill come back and update my review accordingly. (Update - with time\\, this movie even sits worse with me. In fact\\, it's turned me off of Star Wars entirely\\, as ridiculous as that may sound. Just terrible.)","true":true}
