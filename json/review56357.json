Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie. Plot makes no sense. Very few scenes are even filmed well. Any of the progress that was made with The Force Awakens and Rogue One was completely undone. Every complaint I have is an echo of what most other people have said. This is the worst star wars movie since Episode II. It is a big budget movie that goes nowhere. Way to restart your trilogy at the end of the 2nd installment. Idiotic. I am a huge fan of the originals and all this movie does is alienate its core fans and families. I certainly won't recommend this movie to anyone and I won't be buying any merchandise. Perhaps the most disgusting thing is that they have committed to Rian Johnson for another trilogy. The 93 rating from critics is BS. Weak or bad acting\\, terrible script\\, CGI is good buy that is not what makes a movie great.","true":true}
