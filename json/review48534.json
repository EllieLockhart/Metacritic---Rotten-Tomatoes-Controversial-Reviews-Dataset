Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wonder how big the \\\"Top Critic's\\\" Disney checks were. That first top critic comment was complete crap. \\\"Luke returns as wise and patient teacher\\\" please. He abandoned everyone and didn't teach Rey how to BE a Jedi. Grabage. Total grabage.","true":true}
