Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney did not understand the saga\\, the prequels were not a copy of the original trilogy or a remake so why the sequels (the nostalogy) exisit and why not do something else with this rich mythology ? Something that tells a new story without the same plan of the past with new characters who have a real carisim and not place feminisim everywhere it just not credible maybe toxic to make a good film. To me star wars ends in the return of the jedi. ","true":true}
