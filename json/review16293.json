Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not one of these fanboys upset that this movie changed canon\\, doesn't really bother me. Truth is\\, Johnson was so consumed with being subversive he neglected to make a well paced and structured narrative.","true":true}
