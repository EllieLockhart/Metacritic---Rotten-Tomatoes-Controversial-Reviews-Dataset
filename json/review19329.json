Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's now clear at this point that Disney has no overall vision for what they want to do with this trilogy other than sell merchandise.  When Disney bought Star Wars they decided in an unprecidented move to erase the entire creative catalog beyond the original 6 films.  It was understandable at the time as Disney wanted to pursue their own vision for what the future of the franchise holds but unfortunately Disney forgot to create that vision. What we got instead is a game of director telephone writing each film one episode at a time with combating visions not being held in check by any creative lead. The Last Jedi is an anti-sequal. It subverts\\, ignores and out right shows malice contempt for everything that came before it. Whether it's the Original Trilogy or The Force Awakens\\, The Last Jedi finds a way to insult fans expectations instead of surprising them.","true":true}
