Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the low score from audiences really surprised me. after watching the last Jedi I think this is way better than the force awakens. I feel this one really has its own feel to it and doesn't feel like a retelling of another entry in the series before it. Rian Johnson did an amazing job moving the saga forward\\, and I can't wait to see what he has in store for his other outings in the franchise.","true":true}
