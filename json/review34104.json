Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrific movie - will miss seeing Princess Leia in future installments\\, but like the new characters playing forward in the saga's narrative. Wasn't crazy about Laura Dern - but only because she was miscast.  I think a older by the book admiral would have been a better choice like Michael Dorn.","true":true}
