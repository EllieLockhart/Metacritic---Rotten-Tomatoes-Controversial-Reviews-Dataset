Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never seen a franchise so utterly eat itself in one film.  To take such great potential\\, momentum\\, and 40 years of set up and just flush it all down the toilet. The complete lack of respect and regard for the franchise\\, the lore\\, and the most of all\\, the characters is just appalling. It remains the only SW film that I've only watched once in theaters.","true":true}
