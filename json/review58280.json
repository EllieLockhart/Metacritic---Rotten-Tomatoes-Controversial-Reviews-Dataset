Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely brilliant both thematically and cinema making wise. the soundscape and music is incredible. The acting is second to none. The social commentary and all round communal feel is awesome. The character arcs are incredible and callbacks to the originals was fantastic. Laughed loads at the great comedy in film too. Cried at Luke's death and Carrie Walker goodbyes in the film by other characters and the fact her daughter is in the film too brings so much intense emotion. The space Jedi flying scene was so powerful and showed her in glorious light as the incredible human she was. 10\/10. Will try to see it at least 50 times.","true":true}
