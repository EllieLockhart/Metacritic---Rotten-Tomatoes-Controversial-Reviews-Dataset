Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When passengers on the Costa Concordia paid for a cruise they expected to be treated to a relaxing fun filled vacation along the Italian Riviera.  Instead they were subject to the poor decisions of an inattentive\\, inexperienced\\, and unapologetic idiot of a captain who sunk the ship. \\nSimilarly\\, I was expecting to have a wonderful movie going experience to see my childhood heroes in action and even put to rest respectfully.  I expected to enjoy seeing the developments of the new characters introduced from the previous movie and hoped would carry on the Star Wars legacy.  I hoped to be able to pass on to my kids the love that had for this story.   \\nBut instead I was treated to a sinking ship of incongruous story lines\\, shameful slapstick comedy that does not belong in Star Wars\\, nonsensical deaths of long standing beloved characters\\, and cheap lazy script that doesn't explain anything!  NOTHING EXPLAINED!!  I am appalled at how this movie haphazardly eviscerated traditions that have held the hearts of millions of fans for 4 decades.  The dialogue was ridiculous and childish\\, the jokes were stupid\\, the scenes that completely ignore the physics of space were stupid\\, and the new force abilities are stupid.  This movie SUCKS!!  Star Wars is a sunken ship!","true":true}
