Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a terrible movie with a weak plot and uninteresting characters. In addition it's also a disgrace to a cultural legacy. \\nI left the theatre with no desire watch episode IX or any other of the upcoming\\, so-called Star Wars movies. I only feel sorry for the actors whose names will be associated forever with this trash.","true":true}
