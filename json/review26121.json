Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not perfect\\, but damn close. Progresses the characters beautifully in all the ways we needed. Really the best Star Wars since Empire.\\n\\nIf you go in expecting it to make you feel good\\, you never saw Empire Strikes Back. If you go in expecting it to answer a lot of fandom-y wanky questions\\, you are missing the point.","true":true}
