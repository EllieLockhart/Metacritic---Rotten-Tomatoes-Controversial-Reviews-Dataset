Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some of the more passionate Star Wars fans will struggle with The Last Jedi because it does little to nothing to advance the overall mythology of the series. There is no resolution as to which former Sith Lord (or Gungan) is Supreme Leader Snoke\\, there are no new lightsabers\\, there are no new(er) Jedi. What the film does instead is make a major investment in the story it is telling. Although\\, The Last Jedi does contain the clearest expression of exactly what The Force is of the entire franchise\\, it mostly exchanges the universal elements for quality development of the four new\\, major characters. Rey\\, Kylo Ren\\, Finn and Poe are all demonstrably different characters at the end of the film from who they are at its beginning and this is the triumph of The Last Jedi. This Star Wars installment has found room to breathe amidst the action and characters we can invest in beyond merely watching them swing a lightsaber or fly an X-Wing. All of this excellent development is supported by outstanding\\, and at times awe-inspiring\\, visuals (the jump to light speed and the red guards' attack leading the way) and acting that is among\\, if not the best\\, in the series. \\nMark Hamill plays this version of Luke Skywalker as the perfectly jaded and conflicted mentor but is not afraid to recall his youthful audacity when the time comes. It's a credit to the writers and to Hamill that they didn't take an easy way out explaining Ben Solo's turn to the Dark Side and that failure is behind every scene. Daisy Ridley continues to solidify her place as an iconic character in this universe as Rey hits all of the Luke Skywalker notes but replaces his desire to fulfill a destiny with a desire simply to seek what's right. Also a hat-tip to Laura Dern who appears as a purple-haired admiral who spars with Poe and low-key steals every scene she's in. Not only so\\, but her character is the architect of the aforementioned jump to light speed that will become an iconic image in the Star Wars universe.\\nWith all the top-draw acting\\, the stand out of the film is the journey that is Kylo Ren. Adam Driver is on fire the entire film and is creating this character as a perfect picture of rage. It is not that Kylo has violent outbursts but rather that he seems emotionally distressed from scene to scene\\, appearing at various times as a scared little boy or an unhinged warrior or a skilled pilot and at all times a lost soul looking for solid direction. The scenes between Kylo Ren and Rey are the skeleton upon which the movie is built. There is a tense chemistry between Kylo Ren and Rey that is enthralling and sets up a complicated and compelling relationship for Episode IX.\\nThere are certainly a couple moments in the Last Jedi that don't work\\, there is a dip in the middle where the story slows (not unlike The Empire Strikes Back)\\, and calling Maz while she appears to be in the middle of a gun fight doesn't make sense. And while Finn's storyline is compelling as he is a tabula rasa\\, child soldier who is learning with each new experience\\, the way it plays out wastes a little bit of John Boyega. \\nFurthermore\\, the first viewing carries the weight of the passing of Carrie Fisher and with the number of near-death experiences that Leia endures it becomes a little distracting wondering which will be the last one. Fortunately\\, that feeling will fade with subsequent watches and the touching scene between Luke and Leia will be elevated. \\nAll and all\\, the jokes are laugh-out-loud funny\\, the Porgs are cute\\, the Crystal Foxes are beautiful and the Last Jedi is among the best entires in the series\\, in league with its spiritual forerunner The Empire Strikes Back. It takes the opportunity to step away from building an already established universe and takes a deep dive into the characters of this generation. Episode IX and the series as a whole will be all the better for it.","true":true}
