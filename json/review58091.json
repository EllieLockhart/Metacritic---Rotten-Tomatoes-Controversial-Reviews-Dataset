Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars film...EVER. Adam Driver was sensational in this film with his portrayal of Kylo Ren\\, Daisy Ridley is ok but the rest is underwhelming. Rose Tico and Holdo were horrible. The humour is corny and flat it feels forced. There is little character development\\, if at all. I never thought I would hate a Star Wars film this much.","true":true}
