Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Maybe I shouldn't preface my review with this\\, but I'm not your average Star Wars \\\"fan.\\\" So take what I say with a grain of salt unless you are the same. It is hard for me to be pleased by Sci-fi and Fantasy so when I see a movie like Force Awakens and actually think highly of it\\, you know it was a good film. There were a lot of notes that missed for me and a lot of questions that either weren't answered or were answered and I was simply not satisfied with as I saw the absolute potential with this film. Many amazing scenes in this film (some of the best in the franchise) but that couldn't triumph my overall disappointment for the film. Especially feeling like it was set up so well for Rian Johnson. Maybe it was the fact that there were two different directors with opposing opinions on where the Star Wars lore should go. Who know? Certainly not me. I'm just hoping that the conclusion of the trilogy will be a great one. One can only hope.","true":true}
