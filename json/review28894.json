Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really didnt feel like star wars. You go to the movies to escape reality and be imersed in some other world\\, story\\, or history. This movie didnt do that for me and mostly felt like someone had forced their politics down my throat.","true":true}
