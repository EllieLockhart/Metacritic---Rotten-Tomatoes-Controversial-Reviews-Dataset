Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In trying to make a Star Wars film that subverts the fans' expectations Rian Johnson seems to have forgotten that he is making the second film in a trilogy series. The Last Jedi forgets or disregards many of the seemingly important plot points set up by its predecessor and where it does link up to The Force Awakens it does so with a brazen capriciousness that gets to be predictable in it's own right. \\nFrom mishandled characters and inconsequential sub plots to jokes that seem out of place in a galaxy far far away Star Wars fans deserve better. Disney seems to have purchased the Mona Lisa with the intent of finger painting over it.","true":true}
