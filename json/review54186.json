Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If this movie wasn't based off the amazing story of the original Star Wars films and plots\\, I would have thought this was a terrible movie. I'm sorry but once Leia got blown up in to space and survived\\, I was done. Also Snoke? Supreme Leader? Biggest lead up to absolutely nothing I have ever seen. They could have done so much with him. Honestly\\, the moment Kylo took of his helmet and I realized that was Adam Driver underneath the helmet\\, the entire franchise died for me. TERRIBLE casting move. And I hear fans crying because they said they should have gone in the new direction and not have it like the previous older films. Well yeah I'm all about going in a new direction too as long as it's not completely retarded or full of plot holes. The new direction they took was just bad. I feel like they were playing a game of poker going all in with a hand of 2\/5 or 3\/9 hoping to get lucky. Whoever is in charge of all these decisions is retarded.","true":true}
