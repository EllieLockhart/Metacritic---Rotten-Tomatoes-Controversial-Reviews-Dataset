Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I still like The Empire Strikes back and Rogue one more but it was a pretty good movie. some parts kind of shocking hard to explain without spoiling sorry.","true":true}
