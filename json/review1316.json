Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A recycled plot\\, characters that still have no depth or identity\\, and a complete waste of primary characters from the original trilogy. Basically just a 2 and a half hour continuation of Episode 7. How can the critics actually be supportive of this?","true":true}
