Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a good movie. I'm surprised and more than a little irritated at the people posting 1\/2 a star just because they are disappointed about the direction this movie went in. I grew up with Star Wars\\,--I loved it as a child. Was this movie perfect? Of course not! But it was full of heart and extremely entertaining\\, and it  doesn't deserve a 53% approval. Grow up people!","true":true}
