Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They betrayed Luke Skywalker's character. Trying to murder your moody nephew and abandoning your sister\\, best friend and your cause is not in Luke's character.  Superman-style Space Leia scene is god-awful.  Finn and Rose's storyline was utterly ineffectual and pointless.  As a main character\\, Finn has done basically nothing since the beginning.  Snoke is totally underdeveloped.  Captain Phasma again lets us down.  Rey's backstory was a letdown.  Total storyline is jumbled\\, and there were a lot of missed opportunities that leave us nothing to look forward to in episode 9.   To end on a positive note\\, I enjoyed Rose's sister's scene at the beginning in the bomber\\, the Vice Admiral's self-sacrifice via hyperspace made for a beautiful shot\\, and the slave boy's scene at the very end was moving.","true":true}
