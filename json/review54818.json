Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought the film was okay and is set in stone as a part of my favorite series of all time but as okay as i thought it was i need to call out the movie for what it was\\, a clever attempt to secure star wars for the future and only by convincing people\\, especially critics\\, that the disparaging disloyalty to the characters and story set in motion by other better directors (for this series) was genius\\, refreshing and original.. rian planning out everything that real fans and previous directors felt was the tone of the films and doing the opposite is not genius\\, it just sets up for rian and disneys future with star wars and rains new trilogy.. while i get it\\, i am equally disgusted by that choice\\, its taking soething sacred to the fans\\, you know\\, the people who made this whole thing a thing\\, and made it everything on canto bight literally.. but all is said and done and the film was not a total loss.. it did have some amazing visuals and performances by the talented crew on screen and off and on that is where i give all credit to this movie still being likable\\, its only in the story that this falls flat.. and a heads up to the critics who called the last jedi original while calling the force awakens a shot by shot remake of the original star wars\\, first\\, borrowing from a star wars movie in a star wars movie is not a bad thing if its done with balance (as jj abrams did)\\, and secondly\\, while the force awakens borrowed from the original\\, the last jedi borrowed from all three of the originals\\, compare luke giving himself to the emperor to save vader on return of the jedi to rey giving herself to the supreme leader to save kylo\\, complete with the cuffs!! or rebel base on a white desolate planet being attacked by walkers before and escape much like the the opening on empire strikes back or master meeting the apprentice and sacrificing himself to allow his friends to escape much like the original final battle between obi-wan and vader on a new hope.. look again and you'll see how original this film is..  good thing is that jj abrams will be back to the star wars universe for episode 9 to bring peace to the world we love and the proof is in his previous film (aka\\, the most successful film in disney\\, star wars history)","true":true}
