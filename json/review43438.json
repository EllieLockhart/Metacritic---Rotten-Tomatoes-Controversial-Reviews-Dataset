Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was arguably the best Star Wars movie made since the original trilogy. Far better than the Force Awakens and all of the prequels. All of the people hating on it are Star Wars nerds who can't handle any creativity or risk-taking with the franchise. This was an excellent movie by Rian Johnson\\, and I sincerely hope that Disney does not overreact to the ridiculous criticisms of it. Two of the best scenes in the whole saga were in this movie. Luke's illusion and the team-up of Kylo and Rey.","true":true}
