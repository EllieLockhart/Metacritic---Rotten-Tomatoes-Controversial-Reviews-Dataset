Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had all the elements for a great flick.  The tltle alone set it up for greatness.  It's Star Wars for goodness sake!  Good visuals\\, great backstories\\, decades of lore\\, beloved old characters\\, new vilians\\, interesting younger mix of characters from TFA.  \\n\\nHere's what we got instead -\\nTacky jokes - check\\nBad acting - check\\nPlot holes - check\\nDumb death scenes - check\\nCharacter assassination of Luke - check\\nBarely any epic battle scenes - check\\nAnnoying new characters (Rose) - check\\nAttempt to shove new toys at us (Porg) - check\\nIn your face politics throughout - check\\n\\nWay to ruin the most successful franchise in cinema history.  Only 2.5 hours and you flushed it down the commode.","true":true}
