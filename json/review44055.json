Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ is a fun addition to the series and\\, unlike The Force Awakens which preceded it\\, the movie subverts expectations at every turn.  If you go into it thinking  the story is going to go a particular way\\, or thinking \\\"Just another clone of a previous Star Wars movie\\\"\\, prepare to suffer the disappointment of being dead wrong.  The entire movie is one big swerve\\, playing against expectations at every turn.  If you're okay with that\\, you'll likely have a good time.  If not\\, you're probably going to hate it.  As a fan since the opening weekend of the first movie\\, both in canon and in the extended universe\\, I can honestly say I never saw this movie coming\\, and I couldn't be more delighted.","true":true}
