Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A touch of humor\\, twists I honestly didn't see coming\\, and solid performances. I loved it. It's not perfect. Those that didn't like the callbacks in the first movie will not like them here\\, but it's a lighter touch.  I liked how they set the usual story-telling of these kinds of movies a bit on it's head. Go in with no expectations and you'll be happier.","true":true}
