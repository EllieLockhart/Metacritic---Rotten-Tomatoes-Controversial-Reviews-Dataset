Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went into this movie pretty excited to see what happened after the Force Awakens. I walked out of that theater pretty indifferent. And the more I thought about it the more I didn't like it. I hated what they did with snoke. It annoyed me how they brought him up and made him allegedly super powerful and he does absolutely nothing. And then he dies. That irritates me. I don't like how this plot is basically a space race. And how everyone doesn't really do anything. Kylo doesn't do much. Poe and Finn don't do much. Rey doesn't do much. No one does anything that matters. I thought this movie would be more about Luke and it's really not and I'm disappointed in this Star Wars movie. I'm not that excited for the next one after seeing this one. I don't think it's prequels bad but this isn't good. If you're a hardcore Star Wars fan you won't like this. And if you're a casual fan you probably won't like it. Very disappointed.","true":true}
