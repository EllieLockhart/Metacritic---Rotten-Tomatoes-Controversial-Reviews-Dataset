Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I should love this move but for some reason Im afraid i can't. If you are expected a empire clone\\, well I'm sorry it's not going to happen\\, I've been waiting over 30 years to see what a powerful Luke would be like and we don't get it. Mark hamills performance is with out question amazing and I can see why mark said THAT HE DOES NOT AGREE WITH RIAN JOHNSON VERSION OF LUKE SKYWALKER. As for snoke what was the point\\, oh and reys parents normal people who just liked getting drunk WTF sorry but I'm glad JJ has Star Wars back he needs to patch this rift that Johnson has made.","true":true}
