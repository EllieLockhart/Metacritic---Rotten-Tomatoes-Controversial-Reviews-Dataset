Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d delivered a performance leaving you wanting more. No true backstory was told for main characters\\, some were vaguely disclosed and told\\, but no true solid information was given. The movie was visually stunning and the humor was weaved in precise\\, not to take away from what was happening onscreen. Movies sometime leave us hanging on for the next film to come afterwards\\, TLJ was more\\, and to an extent of leaving more questions unanswered\\, and more plot goals to fill. Overall the cinematography and score were terrific and pleasing\\, wished for a better story with more but not an abundance of backstory to let the audience have a more better connection with the main characters.","true":true}
