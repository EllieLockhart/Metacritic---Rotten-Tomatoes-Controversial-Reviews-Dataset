Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS!\\nMaking something of Rey handing over the lightsaber? - Nah\\nExplaining Rey's Mary Sue super powers? - Nah\\nRevealing the mystery of Rey's parents? - Nah\\nRevealing the mystery of Snoke's background - Nah\\nMaking Finn's back injury have an effect?- Nah\\nDeveloping or revealing something about Phasma? - Nah\\nAllowing Luke Skywalker to be bad-ass - Nah\\nPunishing Poe for mutiny and causing deaths? - Nah\\nAdding gaping plot holes? - Yes!
