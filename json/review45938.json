Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually and musically\\, this movie was stunning.  It is a feast for the eyes and ears.  That is why I scored it what I did.\\n\\nTake those elements away and this movie is a zero.  Does not behave in the right Star Wars elements.  Poor character development and just bad script.  I did not care for most of the new characters (except for the code hacker\\, I was intrigued by him).  Not a great movie.","true":true}
