Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not quite sure how i feel about this installment of Star Wars.  Being an old school fan\\, I liked the Force Awakens as it went back to the old school type of filming and set up a new era of storytelling quite well.  I felt more confused with this installment as to just where it was headed towards.  Like I say\\, not quite sure where this is all headed this time.  I guess JJ will decided where we go next.  Hope he knows what to do.","true":true}
