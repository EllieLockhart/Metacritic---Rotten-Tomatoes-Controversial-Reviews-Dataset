Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi will definitely subvert your expectations of what will happen\\, but does so in a good way. It's a real shame that it's divided audiences as much as it has. If Star Wars makes a derivative movie\\, people are mad\\, yet if it makes an original take\\, like The Last Jedi\\, people are still mad. Not sure what people want out of this series.","true":true}
