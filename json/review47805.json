Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While better upon second showing glaring plot holes and impossible last-minute saves let down the 8th movie of the star wars trilogy. The character assassination of a well loved character is perhaps the worst aspect of the movie. \\\"Let the Past Die\\\" is the theme of the movie- apparently disparaging the original series for something new. Nothing can \\\"ruin\\\" Star Wars however what is currently being showed in theaters only has the facade of the epic fantasy rather than the heart of it.","true":true}
