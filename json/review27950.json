Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Please take control away from Johnson! He has singlehandedly changed the mythology of the Star Was universe (in a bad way)\\, threw away some great characters\\, and stole every great moment from the original trilogy in his attempt to create a \u201cnew\u201d Star Wars mythology. There are so many flaws in this film my fingers would cramp up trying to type them all. Safe to say if Disney is REALLY listening to the fans PLEASE bring back Lawrence Kasdan to write with JJ and MAYBE they can salvage this franchise. IF Disney is listening. Anyone who is saying this film is in the same league as \u201cEmpire\u201d truly needs to have their head examined. Everything \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d built up\\, this film destroyed!","true":true}
