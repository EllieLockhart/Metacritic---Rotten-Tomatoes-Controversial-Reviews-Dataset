Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\, the eighth episode in the Star Wars Saga\\, revives the franchise with an original\\, thoughtful\\, and beautifully-shot movie. The story picks up with the Resistance fighting the First Order in an eye-popping space battle and from there it only gets better. Rey finds Luke on the island of Ach-To\\, where the best scenes of the movie take place. The cinematography is incredible\\, and The Last Jedi is the most visually pleasing Star Wars films. All of the actors do great jobs\\, particularly Mark Hamill as Luke\\, Ridley as Rey\\, and Driver as Kylo Ren. The score is great and a step up from last year's Rogue One. Also\\, this movie is very funny\\, and it mostly works. The visuals effects are superb\\, the acting is great\\, and the story is good\\, and more importantly\\, original. While The Force Awakens was a good movie\\, it played it safe as did Rogue One. The Last Jedi is the first Star Wars movie from Disney that I love. It is epic\\, shocking\\, eye-popping\\, and is a great addition to the Star Wars Franchise. If I were to rank it\\, The Last Jedi would be above all three prequels\\, The Force Awakens\\, and Rogue One. My top three\\, in no particular order are The Last Jedi\\, A New Hope\\, and The Empire Strikes Back. I can't say for sure where this movie will end up\\, but it is one of the best Star Wars movies ever made. I am pleasantly surprised\\, and can't wait to see what comes next.","true":true}
