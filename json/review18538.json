{"101487":141736,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-31","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is with great disappointment and profound sadness that I write the following words. This is in response\\, no only to the film\\, but also to posts online regarding how the ever-increasing disparate worlds of thought pertaining to the feelings on The Last Jedi are so seemingly out of control. Also\\, how misunderstood many are relating to their deep and undesired criticisms of the film.\\n\\nIn my opinion\\, (which is worth just as much as anyone's - equal or nothing) the relentless and out of place Robot Chicken humor demonstrated by the cardboard cutout stereotypes\\, seeming to cosplay Star Wars\\, was eclipsed only by the forever altering of the fundamental core of the Luke Skywalker character...the once New Hope\\, who has lost all hope and acted in ways that even a child mixing and matching toys during play time\\, would never had enacted\\, even when coupling a Luke Skywalker figure with Optimus Prime and Cobra Commander!\\n\\nEven Mark Hamill\\, the man who played Luke Skywalker for so many years\\, was disappointed in the direction taken with this character. (He has since walked back many critical statements...read into that what you will\\, but consider the juggernaut that is Disney looming over him...)\\n\\nThere are so many truly confusing and perplexing choices made in this film\\, disguised as edgy decisions\\, designed to propel Star Wars into the future. Meanwhile\\, it did nothing of the sort.\\n\\nInstead\\, it took a legacy film series that was always about bringing people together and drove a molten wedge between brothers and sisters of Star Wars fandom forever. \\n\\nA very un-Star Wars-like thing to do.\\n\\nThe knee-jerk and vitriolic responses to honest criticism of the film has been astonishing. I am a life-long and wholly devoted Star Wars fan and the lack of civil discourse I have witnessed regarding genuine differences of opinion has been even more disheartening than the film itself. This unlike anything we have seen previously... none of the criticisms of the prequels hold a candle to those in which we now find ourselves steeped.\\nProponents of the film are more angry that people felt this film had flaws\\, than the people that are expressing their opinions about those perceived flaws. It's a shame...a wildly disheartening shame.\\n\\nThe juvenile insults hurled at those who disliked the film (\\\"Haters\\\"\\, \\\"Butt-hurt fanboys\\\"\\, \\\"Not true fans\\\"...among myriad others) are completely inappropriate\\, especially when levied at mega-fans who are genuinely discouraged and upset by the unorthodox direction Disney has taken this franchise and are attempting to express their honest (and in many cases\\, we'll-informed and insightful) critiques.\\n\\nThis is not about being immovable or living in the past\\, but more about taking care when dealing with a real and true cultural phenomenon that means so much to so many.\\n\\nI submit that no matter what is produced\\, Disney and their cadres of director and producers will never be able to satisfy everyone. That would be an impossible task. However\\, moving forward with well-thought-out precision\\, factoring in all that came before\\, was what was\/is needed\\, at the very least\\, to bring the Skywalker saga to a close.\\n\\nIf Disney wanted Rian Johnson or another director with radical ideas\\, to take a hard left turn in the Star Wars Universe\\, they should have had him do it after this Skywalker story was concluded\\, instead of directly in the middle of the final chapter of an ongoing 40+ year\\, three-trilogy cycle.\\nJJ Abrams is an old school guy and though he 'consulted' on this one\\, I am willing to bet that his consultation had little impact. Rian Johnson wanted to take the collective's toys and play in his own sandbox\\, away from the other children. JJ has to now wash them off and get back to his story.\\n\\nThe mixing of directors was a mistake. It worked the first time because Lucas was there imbedded in the process and waved influence over the other two... this time\\, the bevy of chefs in the kitchen have prepared a dinner that comprises a fusion of too many flavors\\, reversing the desired effect and resulting in a beautifully brandished\\, yet bland dish. Although it appeared so appetizing on the menu\\, it failed to deliver the savory taste that so many still recall from long ago.\\n\\nThere will always be \\\"haters\\\" who express negativity\\, just as there will always be \\\"fanboys\\\" (or girls or whatever...)\\, who forever cheerlead\\, no matter how the team is playing...\\n\\nBut to take such extreme sides is never a good thing. Just look at American politics...with all of the infighting and party line resolve...who ultimately loses with such constant vitriol and pride?\\n\\nAll of us.\\n\\nIf you are one of the many who loved The Last Jedi\\, then as a member of the brother\/sisterhood\\, I am happy for you. I wish I could share in the euphoria of a new Star Wars film. I truly\\, truly do! I am glad you are able to add a pleasurable and fulfilling experience to the countless others that this Universe has granted us.\\n\\nHowever\\, if you are among the other 'many'\\, who were so disappointed in the film\\, I hope that you find others who can understand your grief and sympathize with your heartfelt disappointment...and that you can weather the storm of cheerleaders and apologists who can never find fault with anything produced by LFL\\, yet are more apt to find fault in their own brothers and sisters opinions\\, instead of supporting them\\, by trying to ease their transition into the new Star Wars paradigm.\\n\\nMay the Force be with You.\\nMay the Force be with us all.\\nCelebrate the light; (Freedom!)\\nCelebrate the might; (Power!)\\nCelebrate the fight; (Glory!)\\nCelebrate the love.\\nCelebrate the love.\\nCelebrate the love.\\nCelebrate the love.\\n\\nYub nub.","true":true}
