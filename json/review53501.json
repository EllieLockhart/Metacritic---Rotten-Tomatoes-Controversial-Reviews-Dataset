Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dumb movies are pretty commonplace these days but this one has to be the dumbest film ive see all year\\, possibly of all time. \\nThe insulting part is that the studio expects people to lap it up and arguably many are doing exactly that. \\nIve seen reviews stating it takes star wars in a new direction but I really fail to see what that direction was and where it leaves the 3rd movie in the trilogy. \\n\\nSecondly the film is intentionally divisive with political undertones forcibly pushed upon audience\\, much like the humour. \\nThese aspects prevent immersion and make the movie that much more of an eye roller to me. \\n\\nSuch a shame for a trilogy with unlimited potential for both old fans and new fans alike.","true":true}
