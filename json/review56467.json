Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The few fantastic scenes and shots\\, such as rey and kylo ren fighting the royal guards and the ship going light speed through the dreadnought\\, are not enough to redeem this piece of garbage. The entire movie feels pointless\\, with far too many parts that leave the viewer saying\\, \\\"why the hell did\/didn't ______  do _______??\\\" For example\\, \\\"why the hell did ruth kill herself and fuck over the entire rebel army just to stop finn from sacrificing himself??\\\" When watching\\, it feels like the movie was written by an 8 year old who saw a star wars movie once. And the scene with leia force-pulling herself back to the ship from outer space is just unforgivable.","true":true}
