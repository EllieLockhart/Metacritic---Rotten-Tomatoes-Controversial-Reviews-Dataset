Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great addition to the series. I think the reasons people give it bad reviews is because their fan theories did not come true\\, and\/or all the hero\u2019s from the episodes 4\\, 5 and 6 have been killed. However I question why Snoke would be portrayed as a big bad guy with a huge role just to get killed off. I also question why Rey\u2019s parents had such importance for them to just be drunks from Jakku. I really hope that these problems in the movie will be resolved in episode 9. Which I think they will. Overall a great movie.","true":true}
