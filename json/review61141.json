The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I really liked the game despite all of the negative reviews! There were some things I had issues with\\, like the pacing\/time jumps of the game - it kind of draws you out of the experience a little bit. However the other aspects of the game mean that it is still really enjoyable to play. The gameplay is fantastic\\, hand to hand combat animations are really fun and make the combat side of gameplay really rewarding. For others\\, the looting system felt repetitive\\, but because of the varied environments (which are all really beautiful\\, brilliant graphics\\, lighting\\, atmosphere) I didn\u2019t feel the same. One other thing I felt enhanced the game was the weapon upgrade system\/animations. It added to the realism of the world and also was nice to see physical changes and upgrades to the weapons. Gameplay flows nicely\\, and is not clunky or awkward\\, which means you can play for longer without getting frustrated or bored. In terms of the story\\, I can appreciate why many people don\u2019t feel satisfied with the game. Some decisions the writers made\\, I felt could have been polished. Playing as Abby for half the game at first was frustrating\\, but after seeing the developments to abbys character it became more bearable. I also enjoyed the difference in her fighting animations\\, as she is SIGNIFICANTLY stronger than Ellie. If the story feels confusing or pointless\\, I really recommend watching Nathan zed\u2019s thoughts on the game on YouTube. It gave me a new perspective :)\u2026 Expand","true":true}
