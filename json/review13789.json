Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I found the humour distasteful (example: dribbling blue milk Luke)\\, the politics dubious (example: Why does the whitest male member of the resistance inherit leadership from Leia when she's healthy and able?) and the continuity poor (example: If Rey is nobody\\, how come Kylo Ren had heard \\\"so much\\\" about her in episode XII?). Marks for acting and production\\, but this is rather a mess at the best of times..","true":true}
