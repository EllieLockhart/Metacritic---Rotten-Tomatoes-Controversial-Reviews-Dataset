Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is one of my favorite Star Wars movies! I thought the visuals were beautiful\\, the story interesting and the dialogue sharp. My favorite overall character was definitely Rey and my favorite new character was Admiral Holdo. It's sad to see Holdo getting so much hate because Oscar Isaac is hot. My favorite scene was her sacrifice because Star Wars is a franchise that is built on sound and score\\, so having a completely silent moment left me stunned. My one issue with the movie is there seems to be a lack of overall planning and narrative for the trilogy as a whole. We aren't building up to something in the way the previous trilogies had been and Ryan Johnson clearly didn't agree with the direction that JJ wanted to take the franchise COUGHSnokeCOUGH.","true":true}
