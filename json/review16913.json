Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In what world does Justice League get a 78% rating and this 53%? Overall this was a great addition to the franchise. I had a lot of fun watching this movie. However\\, I felt the movie didn't go anywhere just for the sake of twists. Definitely the best movie I watched this year.","true":true}
