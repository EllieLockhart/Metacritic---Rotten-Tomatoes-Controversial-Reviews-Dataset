Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Tragic! It ignores every film in the series. This film is full of awkward moments\\, bad jokes\\, forced relationships\\, major plot holes\\, and they managed to turn the franchise's captain America into everyone's drunk uncle. Forget about killing the past\\, this film killed the franchise. I can't even watch the previous films without feeling frustrated.","true":true}
