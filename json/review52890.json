Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An absolute insult to the legacy of Star Wars. Incredibly poor quality and inconsistent screenwriting. Lack of development for new characters and the destruction of Luke Skywalker' s character. No longer is he filled with hope\\, he's stuck moping around on his island drinking green milk. That's right the same guy who saw the light in Darth Vader\\, tried to murder his own nephew\\, Kylo Ren. Speaking of which Kylo Ren is back and now he's shirtless. There's a  completely useless scene where Finn travels to a casino\\, and he frees some space horses and gets a parking ticket. Snoke turns out to be nobody just like Rey's family\\, In fact he gets killed in this installment. They introduce this purple hair character after Leia flies through space like Mary Poppins\\, who is even worse than Jar Jar Binks. And to add even more insult they kill of Luke Skywalker at the very end of the movie. Skip this one go watch the OT or a Marvel movie instead.","true":true}
