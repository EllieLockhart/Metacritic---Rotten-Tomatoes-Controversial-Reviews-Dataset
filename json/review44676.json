Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Total utter garbage. So many plot holes\\, so many dumb jokes........Messes with SW's lore and dismisses ALL previous SW's films\\, even TFA. A real mess of a movie. And they portrayed Luke as some kinda depressed loser who ends up killing himself........yeah....Like that really makes sense after what we've seen of Luke in the entire original trilogy. \\nAs for Rian Johnson\\, I can't say anything or this review would most likely be banned........or something like that. But to put it really really mildly\\, what a dick! I hope he never directs another movie...PERIOD!","true":true}
