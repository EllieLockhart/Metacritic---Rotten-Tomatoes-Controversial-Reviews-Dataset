Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed it. I'd see it again. Was it long at times? Sure. Are there some oddities with the fact that the Rebels are reduced to a handful of heroes trapped in a cave? Yes. But the movie falls right into place and sets up the rest of the story.","true":true}
