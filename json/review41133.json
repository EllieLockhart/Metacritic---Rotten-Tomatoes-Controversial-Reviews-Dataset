Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had wonderful visuals and some interesting scenes. However\\, as a whole it is the worst movie in the Star Wars series. It completely destroys the rules\/lore of the universe and has way too many plot holes. It's also filled with terrible comedy that fails to land and is out of place in many scenes. If you are a die hard SW fan you probably won't like it. If you are a casual movie goer\\, I'm sure you will enjoy the movie.","true":true}
