Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wife and I just got done seeing this movie\\, and we loved it. I dont know what most fans hated about it. Fin was great and his character is starting to get alot better. Rey's story is starting to unfold nicely...if a tad bit slow. If  you follow the books you know who Rey is. I think they could have done a better job bringing everything together better but for the most part we really enjoyed it.","true":true}
