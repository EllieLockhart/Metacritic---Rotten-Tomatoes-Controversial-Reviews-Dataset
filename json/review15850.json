Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I LOVE Star Wars. While there were some cool effects in the movie\\, I'm not sure there's ever been a worse story line. Horrible HORRIBLE writing. I'm only leaving a review because it was so discouraging. 9 better be a perfect film because 8 screwed over fans.","true":true}
