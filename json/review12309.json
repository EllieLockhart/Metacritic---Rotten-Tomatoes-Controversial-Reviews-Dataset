Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am so disappointed I am beyond words. Disney and Rian Johnson destroyed this franchise and this movie. The whole casino planet seen Dash I wish I had just gone to the bathroom instead. Casting\\, the contrived lines and acting and plot points\u2026 It just goes on anon there were a couple good battle scenes for sure and Daisy Ridley is amazing but the rest of this movie was total trash.","true":true}
