Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So much anticipation for this movie\\, only to see Luke toss the \\\"light sword\\\" over his shoulder and jack off a sea monster to drink his green goo and let it drip down his beard. This movie had zero redeeming qualities\\, and I wont spend another dime on anything Star Wars related until they right this ship. I saw TFA awakens 3 times. Loved it. I wish I hadn't seen this movie.","true":true}
