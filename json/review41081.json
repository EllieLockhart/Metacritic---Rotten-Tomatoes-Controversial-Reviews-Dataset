Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had everything a long time Star Wars fan could want in a Star Wars movie. Obviously there were some plot holes\\, and some of the ways they used the force were a bit of a leap\\, but let's be real here. If you can go along with Obi-won and Yoda coming back as force projections\\, than everything that happened in this movie is in the realm of possibility. I will be seeing this again.","true":true}
