Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A better outing than The Force Awakens\\, but the story itself is poorly laid out and filled with plotholes. Fails to answer questions setup in the Force Awakens\\, and so I came away feeling somewhat cheated. Overall I enjoyed it\\, but not the great film the reviews promised.","true":true}
