Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lacking any emotion and soul\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the latest in a string of disappointments in the series.\\n\\nWhile the action and visuals at times are nice and well executed from a technical standpoint\\, sadly they are overshadowed by flaws in nearly every area that ultimately sink the film.\\n\\nThe characters are flat and unlikable; the dialogue is inane; the acting is impressively poor; the plot twists are unsatisfying and shrug-worthy; the plot itself is generally nonsensical; the incessant comic relief is forced\\, out of place\\, and -- most unforgivably -- not funny; and the rewriting of much of the Star Wars universe lore comes off more as a middle finger to fans of the series rather than a genuine attempt to continue and expand the storytelling.\\n\\nIt's very sad to see yet another fumble in the Star Wars saga.  What started off with three fantastic and entertaining films with real heart has devolved into farce.","true":true}
