Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An enjoyable follow-up to TFA that adds texture to the Star Wars universe that we haven't seen in a feature before. I did not love it\\, as I did TFA and Rogue One when I first saw them\\, but I really\\, really liked it\\, even when it did things with the material that I didn't expect or agree with. \\n\\nHighlights: WW2 style bombing run; Poe being heroic\\, but learning much about leadership by the end of the film; some of the best dialogue since Empire; an interesting\\, character-based arc for Luke Skywalker\\, eschewing the temptation of one note fan service; one of the most compelling villains of sci fi in Kylo Ren; gripping use of force visions and astral connection & projection; some of the best space battles since RotJ and RotS; one of the best lightsaber battles since the prequels. Excellent use of a diverse cast. \\n\\nDisappointments: unexplained force powers that stretch the bounds of audience engagement; unsatisfying arc for Snoke; much less myth-building and lore-delving than I wanted.\\n\\nStill\\, a solid B+\/A- movie. I didn't love it as much as many others did\\, but I don't really understand the hate. It's certainly better than any of the prequels\\, and possibly RotJ.","true":true}
