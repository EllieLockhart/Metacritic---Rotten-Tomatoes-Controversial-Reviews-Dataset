{"101487":146497,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was completely underwhelmed with the premise\\, the story line and the writing. In my eyes\\, they through out the long legacy of the Jedi and truly diminished the path to become one The struggle\\, the effort\\, the wisdom needed too become one with the Force was reduced to someone who just \\\"gets it\\\". \\n\\nThe Force is not math or violin\\, where prodigies can rise from the ranks of three year olds\\, this is philosophy and martial arts.  One is not born a great philosopher or martial artist\\, it takes years of study\\, of perfecting one's mind and body respectively\\, of seeking wisdom from those who might seem beyond their time\\, but through their awareness and study are far more powerful than these acolytes could possible imagine. The egalitarian view of \\\"not needing these old books anymore\\\" diminishes the universe George Lucas created. It makes a meritocracy into pure democracy\\, where anyone can gain great power without the restrictions of having to learn to fight against temptations\\, and temper one's mind to the truth of the universe that's so difficult to discern from this \\\"crude matter\\\".\\n\\nI also was honestly... bored. I thought the pace was sluggish\\, the extra plot lines unnecessary and distracting from the greater arc\\, and the way all of this fell together seemed sloppy. We were asked to care about characters we just met or barely or knew\\, and these characters became love interests and\/or heroes because the writer\/director wanted us to see them as such. They didn't win us over.\\n\\nMark Hamill himself disagreed with Rian Johnson\\, saying \\\"I fundamentally disagree with virtually everything you've decided about my character\\\". He later back-pedaled\\, but I agree with Mr. Hamill that THIS was not Luke Skywalker. This was not what he\\, nor the great Skywalker legacy deserved as an ending. This story arc was supposed to be about the Skywalkers and their prophecies\\, good or ill. Plot twists with a Solo here\\, a Kenobi there\\, were bantered about... but if Ben Solo's \\\"vision\\\" was true\\, that Rey really came from nobodies and could do things it took a Jedi decades to master\\, then this forced attempt at egalitarianism diminishes the entire storyline that came before it.\\n\\nLastly\\, the villains of this storyline greatly disappointed me. All the theories of \\\"where Snoke came from\\\" were unanswered\\, and really it didn't matter because he came off as an overpowered two-bit villain who messed with \\\"a Sicilian [read that as Solo] when death was on the line\\\". He was thrown in as a plot device to prematurely elevate Emo Ren (that is not an autocorrect) to arch-nemesis. This wannabe could not hold a candle to Vader or the Emperor\\, who became the symbols of pure evil during the 80's. Even then\\, Luke never gave up on Vader's redemption\\, though he seemed so much farther gone than a conflicted Ben Solo. This appears not the case with Rey and ultimately Luke and Leia toward the end of the movie.\\n\\nIn my eyes\\, from a longtime fan\\, THIS was not Star Wars. I really wanted to like it\\, but even my wife and kids walked away with a \\\"that was it?\\\" attitude. I'm hoping Disney takes this to heart and brings back the Joseph Campbell-esque story arc\\, the stuff of myth and heroic and noble struggle against enemies truly worth the name villian.","true":true}
