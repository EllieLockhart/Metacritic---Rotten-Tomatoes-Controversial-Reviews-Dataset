Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"90%?!?!?!? Either they were paid off or these people have never seen this film or any other star wars film for that matter. Felt like a weird cult action film\\, not a film from such an amazing and expansive universe.  Cringe worthy dialogue\\, bad action\/stunts\\, bad story telling and character development. Catered EXCLUSIVELY to children who have never seen another Star Wars film and do not know anything about the history or importance of the Star Wars universe. With small instances like; \\\"look its Chewbacca!\\\" so that the real fans feel like they're being heard (we're not).  EA is making better Star Wars Games.  EA is treating us better than Disney\\, its sad! Just soooooooo bad. HOT TRASH.  do not watch. \\n\\nLook how they massacred my boy :(","true":true}
