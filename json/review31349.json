Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some great CGI but a poorly written movie with far too many sub plots that feel unnecessary and make the film far too long with no real payoff or impact on the main plot of the film. The Last Jedi has done far more harm to the Star Wars franchise than any of the prequels ever did.\\n\\nWithout spoiling this movie it simply undoes many of the story arcs set up in the previous movie: The Force Awakens and the main underlying theme in this movie seems to be that none of the story or lore from any previous movie matter. The whole point of a franchise like Star Wars is the continuation of the story.  It is without a doubt the worst of the Star Wars movie if you consider only the plot and don't take the visuals in to account which are to its credit very good.","true":true}
