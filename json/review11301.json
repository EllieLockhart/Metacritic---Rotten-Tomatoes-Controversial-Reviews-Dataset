Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly wasn\u2019t very impressed to have things i waited two years for just be thrown under the dust and have no importance\\, even more so no questions were answered\\, just a pile on to the crazy amount of info.","true":true}
