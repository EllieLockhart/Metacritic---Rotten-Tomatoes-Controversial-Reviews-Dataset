Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Who are the First Order? Where do they come from? Who is snope where did he come from? Why are Rey's parents just meh? The republic bombers are the worst weapon ever made. \\n\\nStory: 2.5\\nWhile some great elements the story was ruined by plot holes. Luke Skywalker was abused.\\n\\nTechnical: 0.5\\nThis film had so many technical holes they were hard to ignore. Usually\\, I try and suspend disbelief but this movie was terrible. Bombs dropping to what gravity?\\nGuns designed to kill fighters suddenly cant hit them\\, opening doors to space now is ok with no airlock\\, going into hyperspace now destroys massive ships as you fly past their location...um...why arent hyperspace missiles a thing?\\, why did she wait to fly into them?\\n\\nPlot holes:\\nToo many to list. There are literally four thousand plot holes in this move.","true":true}
