Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not the worst SW film\\, but certainly one of the most disappointing. It craps on the legacy of the OG characters under the theme if the film \\\"the past must die.\\\" While you can't fault Disney for wanting to move forward with the modern cast\\, it is a shame they decided to tear apart the character's before shoving them out the door.No spoilers:\\nSTAR WARS 8 has some cool scenes that are essentially wrapped in a 2.5+ hour film overflowing wtf moments\\, plot decisions that make 0 sense whatsoever\\, character betrayals that are so jaw-droppingly bad I can't believe Disney did them\\, stark callbacks to the prequels (in a very bad way)\\, New characters that are absolutely pointless\\, throwaway villains\\, and a dragging pace that you really feel through to the final act. I can see why Mark Hamill hated the script. Who let Disney do this?","true":true}
