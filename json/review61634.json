How in the world could Naughty Dog so thoroughly destroy some of the most beloved video game characters of all time? Killing Joel in the way that they did was an absolute disgrace to his character and spit in the face of the fans. Then being FORCED to play as his murderer for HOURS while they poorly try to make her out to be a sympathetic character is insane. I felt no sympathy for Abby or her friends and all I wanted to do was slay all of them in the most brutal fashion possible the entire game. I didn't think it was possible to so thoroughly destroy everything I loved about the first game\\, but Naughty Dog\/Neil Druckmann managed to pull that off in a spectacular fashion. If you are a fan of the first game like I am\\, then please for the love of God DO NOT BUY THIS GAME... Don't even watch a play through on Youtube. I wish I could erase the story of this game from my mind and just keep the memory of the first game alive and well. This is not even hyperbole\\, the story is that horrifically bad IMO. I could go on for hours about the faults with the story in this game but I'll leave at that for now. I'll give it two points for amazing graphics\\, environments\\, great voice acting\\, and decent game play\\, but minus 8 for horrific writing. 2\/10...\u2026 Expand","true":true}
