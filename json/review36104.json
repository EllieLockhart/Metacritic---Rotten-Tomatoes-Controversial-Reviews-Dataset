Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was a great 2nd installment in the saga's final trilogy. Picking up where The Force Awakens left off\\, we get to see what happens after Rey find Luke on the island\\, and what happens next with the First Order led by Kylo Ren. The film adds some new characters\\, new locations and features some exciting action sequences that feel right at home in the Star Wars galaxy. Humor is consistent and genuinely funny\\, and there are enough little surprises to keep Star Wars fans entertained throughout the film.","true":true}
