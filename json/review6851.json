Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"DON\u0092T WORRY IF YOU HAVEN\u0092T SEEN IT.....NO SPOILERS HERE!\\nI went to this on the opening night\\, with my two sons.\\nWe had managed to avoid spoilers and had only watched the teaser and full trailer. I did not want the movie to end.....so many great moments ....And more than a few surprises.\\nNo wonder Rian Johnston has been given a full trilogy of his own to make\\, this really is a great movie!\\nThe reviews were saying \u0091best since Empire\u0092......don\u0092t they always say that? My view is that it really is the best one since Empire ie this is the first time (in my opinion) that one of the original trilogy has been bettered (Return of the Jedi)\\n\\nMy boys loved it too!\\n\\nThe force is strong with this one! Sorry I couldn\u0092t resist.....ha ha","true":true}
