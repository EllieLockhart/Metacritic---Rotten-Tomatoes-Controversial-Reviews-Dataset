Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some reviews seem really harsh. Not as disjointed a plot line as some made it out to be\\, and goofy humor was nowhere near prequels level. Not a great movie\\, but people who said they walked out of theater during TLJ are either lying or weird. Go get your Star Wars fix\\, but it will never be like the first time!","true":true}
