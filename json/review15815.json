Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love \u201cStar Wars\u201d as much as the next guy regardless of the disdain I hold for Disney\u2019s incessant franchising. I feel like a little kid again when John William\u2019s iconic score accompanies crisp yellow text atop a star field\\, the precedent for each installment\\, and according to the box office numbers\\, I'm not the only one. Naturally\\, I was surprised to see the immense negative backlash to December\u2019s \u201cStar Wars: The Last Jedi.\u201d A month past the release of the movie\\, it seems more purposeful now to examine the criticism launched at the film than the actual film itself. When the review embargo lifted on December 12\\, just days before the film\u2019s release\\, early reactions seeped out across the web. There was almost universal praise; \u201cDirector Rian Johnson has made the best \u2018Star Wars\u2019 movie since \u2018The Empire Strikes Back!\u2019\u201d Needless to say\\, the celebration was short-lived as the review amalgam site Rotten Tomatoes received an influx of negative user reviews. While the film sits pretty at 90% with critics\\, the audience score is at an unprecedented 49%\\, a lower rating than the flop \u201cJustice League\u2019s\u201d 77% audience score. It is worth mentioning that the most highly acclaimed episode in the saga\\, \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back\u201d opened to mixed reviews too\\, but how could there be such a divide between fans and critics? I've said it before\\, and I\u2019ll say it again: Rotten Tomatoes does not matter. With a whopping 31 thousand user reviews for \u201cStar Wars\u201d as opposed to \u201cJustice League\u2019s\u201d 10 thousand\\, it seems as though the angriest voice is loudest. It has become trendy to hate \u201cThe Last Jedi\\,\u201d and it is not difficult for a fanbase to manipulate the review aggregator. While \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d has a Rotten Tomatoe fan score equivalent of an F\\, its counterpart Cinemascore has an A rating. Cinemascore tends to be the more reliable source for gauging actual fan reactions because scores are collected from exit polls at select movie theaters. It seems that casual fans of \u201cStar Wars\\,\u201d from which Lucasfilm Ltd. and parent company Disney derive the majority of their money\\, enjoyed the film more than the explosively negative pocket of angry die-hard fans. It is true that \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d is making significantly less money than its predecessor\\, but this was bound to happen regardless of fan reaction. \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d opened to a much different market. The first \u201cStar Wars\u201d film in 10 years garnered much more excitement. Additionally\\, there was less competition after release. \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d was the only big family film of the holiday in 2015. \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d had to compete with \u201cPitch Perfect 3\\,\u201d \u201cFerdinand\u201d and \u201cJumanji: Into the Jungle.\u201d Upon reading some of the fan reviews\\, I noticed the repetition of several very similar ideas: \u201cLuke Skywalker is ruined\\, there is too much social justice warrior crap\\,\u201d and \u201cthey didn't answer my questions.\u201d I understand some of the complaints. It can be disappointing when a character is portrayed differently than expected\\, but few of these reviews offer legitimate criticism. Just saying that Luke Skywalker\u2019s character was assassinated isn't enough. There is no regard for how the evolution of this character impacts the themes of the film. Very few have even commented on how Mark Hamill played the character\\, or how his story served to advance the main protagonist of the movie\\, Rey. Without the context of a previous film\\, these complaints would be non-existent. That is not to say that they shouldn't be considered\\, but the writing and filmmaking here has gone unnoticed. As for \u201csocial justice warrior crap\\,\u201d all good films have some sort of underlying moral. In \u201cThe Last Jedi\\,\u201d there is a clear message about corruption and animal cruelty. To those who complain about this\\, is it really a bad thing? The moral never overtakes the story and leads to an exciting sequence. There is a weak subplot with characters Finn and Rose that comes hand-in-hand with these subtextual ideas\\, but the issue with the subplot has more to do with its lack of impact on the overall story\\, not its messages. Being the second film in a trilogy\\, naturally there are loose ends. To disregard the film for not answering every question posed in \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d is unfair without having seen the third installment. If questions continue to go unanswered after Episode IX\\, which in some cases may be true\\, then these critiques are valid. Until December 2019\\, it simply is not fair to base the merits of this film on unanswered questions. It seems fans are more likely upset that their theories have been nullified by events in \u201cThe Last Jedi.\u201d From a personal standpoint\\, I happen to agree with several of the actual criticisms presented by fans. I'm not just a \u201cStar Wars\u201d fanboy. This is no perfect movie. It has a pacing issue\\, there is an unnecessary subplot\\, some of the humor undercuts tense moments and it seems that characters were wasted. Take into account however\\, that these are complaints that can be pinpointed and explained by examining the screenplay and creative choices made by Johnson that don't enhance the story. There is a clear distinction between criticism and nitpicking. The insufferably hostile attitudes of online review communities have spoiled the moviegoing experience for many. It is just a movie\\, and everyone has the right to share their opinion on it\\, but for the sake of argumentation\\, have a damn good reason. I don't care that \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d ruined your childhood. ","true":true}
