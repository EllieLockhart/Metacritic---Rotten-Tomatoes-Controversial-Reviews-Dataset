Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Force Awakens is a very solid\\, \\\"respectable\\\" entry into the established lore\\, letting the audience know it sees the long-time fans\\, and is here to give them a second helping of an already-established-favorite dish.\\nLast Jedi comes along\\, and says\\, \\\"Hey\\, you know you can take that same set of ingredients\\, and make a completely new and intriguing dish?\\\"\\nLast Jedi does something that the other SW movies did not do as a main story (and that Rogue One did incidentally to the main war story): there is more in this galaxy than the Importance of the Skywalkers. Regular people\/things exist\\, and have power too. \\nAnother thing that Last Jedi does: the business of war. By this point\\, the economy and development of this galaxy has centered around the prolonged war between the established central government and the various opposing factions for at least 50 years; is there any other business or major economic force (heh) in this galaxy\\, other than that? I mean\\, it's no wonder all their tech has remained unchanged: all major resources go to continuing wars and amusing the rich.\\nThe overall themes of Last Jedi I'm still digesting\\, but it's definitely the most humanistic one\\, and my favorite.","true":true}
