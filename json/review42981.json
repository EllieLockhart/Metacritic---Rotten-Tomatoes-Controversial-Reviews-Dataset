Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was terrible! Nothing important was done with the main characters\\, the answers we all wanted to questions we all had were lame and unimaginative\\, and huge chunks of the movie turned out to be completely pointless. This took everything that was wonderful about Star Wars and crapped all over it. If JJ Abrams can save this smoking pile of rubbish then he will have absolutely earned my respect as a writer and film director because he has his work cut out for him. This movie was bad\\, bad\\, bad! At this point I can't even fathom seeing this as part of Star Wars canon because in my mind I want it to be a horrible dream that I'll wake up from in two years and see that all this mess I just saw never happened. Hey! There you go... JJ can say that this movie was a Force vision that Rey had of a possible future. She'll wake up on the Falcon after meeting Luke and they'll all go save the Galaxy from the all powerful and evil Snoke... Sigh...","true":true}
