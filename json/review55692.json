Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"OMG\\, worst way to reboot a franchise.  Should've been a straight to VHS movie.  Yes I meant straight to VHS since no one uses that format anymore and this would've gone unseen.  \\n\\nDisney and Rian Johnson should be ashamed.  It's not that it couldn't of been good but has lots of flaws.  \\n\\nMake the hero the zero?  Jedi don't give up.\\nLeia can avoid a vacuum death\\, and fly? LOL\\nThrow away the laser sword your dad owned\\, that you owned.?  It's a sign of goodness\\, not just a weapon.\\nThe strong evil guy\\, cut in half?  too easy.\\nKylo is a lousy villain with mediocre abilities for the Skywalker lineage.\\nThe force ghosts can now interact with the real world?  Then why didn't Obi Wan\\, Qui Gon or dozens of others stop Darth Vader\\, Sidious\\, or any other bad guys from killing the kids in two separate movies now?  \\n\\nGood thing I wont have to be excited for IX.  And I'm not even a huge Star Wars fan and I was offended by this travesty.","true":true}
