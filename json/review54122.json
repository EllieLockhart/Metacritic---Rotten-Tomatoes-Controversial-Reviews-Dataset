Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't understand or respect the decisions most characters take in this movie which is why\\, as a Star Wars fan\\, found this movie difficult to watch.\\n\\nLuke\\, despite a major setback\\, abadons his friends and family to their fate. He shows little to no empathy to Rey and the situation she is in. And in his last scene\\, it seemed his motivation was to confront Ren and face his failure rather than save the resistance.  If he came back to save everyone AND knew of a way out of the cave\\, expect at least a\\,  \\\"you jeed to get out\\, I'll hold them off.  The exit is that way.\\\"   Luke in this movie becomes one of the all-time movie jerks.\\n\\nOther decisions made by protagonists just don't make sense.  Poe sends Finn\/Rose to another planet in an escape pod\\, but if that can be done\\, why doesn't everyone on that cruiser escape the same way?  The New Order a suddenly led by an inept Daffy Duck type character (Hux) that can't do anything right. Rey\\, after a couple of days with old man grumpus\\, decides she wants to save Kylo\\, very quickly forgetting that he did murder Han in cold blood. And so on... Johnson creates such a weak plot that everyone needs to be dumbed down for story to move along.","true":true}
