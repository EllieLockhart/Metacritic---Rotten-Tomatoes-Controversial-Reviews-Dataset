{"101487":183397,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2019-01-10","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This may be the single most destructive movie I have ever seen. I created this account because the - at the time of typing this - 91% Tomatometer score by critics is appalling. Lets list a few things The Last Jedi (TLJ) ruined: \\nspace battles: if you can hyperspace ram into capital ships\\, space battles no longer make sense. \\nLeia: if there's one thing that could have gave TLJ some bit of emotion and bite\\, it would have been if Leia sacrificed herself instead of Holdo; instead\\, with Carrie Fisher's passing\\, we have Leia pointlessly living on for no reason. \\nThe First Order: how are we supposed to respect a villain when the first time we see them they fall for a prank call. \\nThe Rebellion: how the First Order managed to whittle down an entire galactic government to a handful of survivors within 2 movies baffles me. Now the \\\"resistance\\\" is so small and pathetic they effectively don't exist outside of Rey and her magical Mary Sue powers. \\nSnoke: he's not Darth Jar Jar\\, he's not Darth Plagueis\\, he's nobody; with no explanation\\, what could have been an interesting character is simply killed off. \\nRey: her parents being nobodies just makes her an even less interesting character with zero explanation for being a Mary Sue - at least being Luke Skywalker's kid would have given her some excuse. \\nFinn: again\\, they ruined his heroic sacrifice; his character arc came full circle\\, he defeated his nemesis\\, and he learned bravery - so they sabotaged his heroic sacrifice in one of the dumbest scenes in cinematic history. \\nKylo Ren: now the one thing that could have saved the movie is if they really went through with it - if Rey joined Kylo Ren - this would have really stirred things up for the franchise in an interesting and dynamic way. Rey could try to change the first order from within\\, Kylo could be swayed back toward the light side - it would have been interesting - but instead\\, we just end the film with the status quo\\, the good guys vs the bad guys and no interesting grey area. \\nHoldo & Admiral Akbar: here's an idea - instead of introducing an annoying new character nobody cares about\\, why not have the heroic sacrifice be done by Admiral Akbar? It's a heck of a lot better than unceremoniously killing him off screen. \\nSpace Travel: how can Finn take some ship to some planet and back? Why didn't everybody just abandon ship that way? How can they travel to a planet at sub-light speeds in less than a few months? \\nThe Salt Planet: I get that they've already done jungle\\, ice\\, temperate\\, sky and desert planets but come on - why is this silly salt planet worth going to? Other than it kicks up red dust so we can think Luke Skywalker blew up in a bloody mess? \\nLuke Skywalker: Luke\\, quite simply\\, would not behave like that. If he saw the light in Darth-freaking-Vader\\, he CERTAINLY would not have tried to kill his own nephew in his sleep. He wouldn't even have thought about it. Also\\,  after doing something admittedly pretty cool as a force projection\\, he just... dies anyway. Without ever truly reuniting with Leia\\, Han\\, Chewie\\, or anyone. Weak. \\nThose are just some gripes. I have plenty more - Poe\\, Hux\\, Phasma\\, C-3PO\\, Rose\\, etc. are all useless characters with little to do. The casino planet diversion was pointless and boring. DJ is an annoying character\\, etc. You get the point. This isn't just a bad movie\\, it has severely damaged if not killed the reputation of this major franchise for me. If there is anything positive to come from this movie\\, it's that it makes the prequel trilogy look great by comparison.","true":true}
