If there's something specific you wanted out of this game\\, you may not like it as much as me. If you can't keep an open mind or you're just a bigot you might even be on here giving the game a zero. The game isn't perfect in every respect and has some jarring transitions in story and gameplay near the middle portion. You may not even \\\"like\\\" this game. It isn't \\\"fun\\\" the way some other games are. It filled me with a sickening sense of dread at the fate or actions of my favorite characters. There will be painful moments where you watch characters make decisions you don't agree with. But the game isn't made for you to like it or to be traditionally enjoyable. It isn't a game that cashed in on the latest trends or played it safe to reach the broadest audience. It's a game that was made to get a point across and make you think about what's important to you. And by the credits I had no doubt that it had accomplished that goal. That's the mark of a true work of art. I can't ask for anything more than that.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
