Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney must have bought their positive reviews because this movie is terrible and just plain stupid. There's hardly any time for character development amidst all the tedious fan service. Slapstick humor and sight gags take any gravity out of the film. Every time this movie makes a bold choice it is immediately reversed. It's as if there was a decent script and then a committee came in and said \\\"oh no\\, this part might be too dark or sad. Add a fart joke!\\\". A completely spineless corporate affair.","true":true}
