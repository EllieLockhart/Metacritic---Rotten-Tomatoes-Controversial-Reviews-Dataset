Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just terrible. This is some childish Disney film that took themes from Star Wars. The plot is awful\\, regardless of whether it\u0092s Star Wars or not. I don\u0092t know why they\u0092re obsessed with the theme of \u0091anyone can be special\\, you don\u0092t have to be a skywalker\u0092. People watch star wars for the field wielding and lightsaber duels\\, not stupid ship cleaners who are given major roles to satisfy the SJW crowd. And the best part about this new trilogy was snoke\\, who turned out to be a complete waste of time and totally slapped the audience in the face. What is the point in developing and interesting character and using it to justify the first order\u0092s unexplained strength if you kill that character before explaining anything or using him to his full potential. Honestly\\, why did Disney hire Rian Johnson\\, who previous films are also terrible - his directing is exemplary but script is abominable and\\, frankly\\, I feel like the potion of my life that I spent playing Star Wars with friends or by myself with figurines as a child is invalidated by this non-star Wars trash that seems to have been defecated by Disney\u0092s most unimaginative and primitive team. I can\u0092t even see a point in watching the next film because there are no interesting characters left\\, and no feasible way there can possibly be a major conflict as both sides have lost nearly everything in terms of assets. Not sure how the 20-person strong resistance is going to muster a new fleet\\, but I won\u0092t be surprised if Disney maintains this terrible script writing which seems to only appeal to 4-year olds. So disappointed.","true":true}
