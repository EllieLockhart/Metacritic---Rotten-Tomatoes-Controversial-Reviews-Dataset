Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it. Glad to see SW moving on and bringing in new characters. I grew up on the original trilogy and was sad to see some of my favorites go\\, but it has to happen. Movie was beautiful and humor was well placed.","true":true}
