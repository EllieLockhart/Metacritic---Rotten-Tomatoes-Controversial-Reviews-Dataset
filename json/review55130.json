Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was rather excited to see the last Jedi and see how they filled in some of the plot holes and questions left over from the the force awakens.  I was very disappointed and rather pissed off how they handled this movie from a story and pacing point.  I don't like how ray had no force training and almost none in this movie and was as powerful as kylo ren who has trained his whole life.  I don't like that she has no lineage to speak of.  I was very pissed off how Snoke was built up like the emperor and had very little pay off and almost no back story.  I was incredibly disappointed how Luke very uncharacteristically got cynical and basically did nothing\\, no real training no fighting.  Then had simply died from basically force exhaustion.  And not to mention I don't think Adam Driver was a good fit for Kylo Ren from the beginning. He's not scary and his bonefidas was quite damaged when he basically lost to a girl in the last movie who never held a light saber before.  I have no idea how disney can do such a good job with marvel but have to put soo much political correctness in a star was story without actually making it even good because of it.","true":true}
