Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A brilliant addition to the Star Wars universe. Having seen each movie in the series dozens of times\\, I can honestly say that I am very satisfied with how Rian Johnson handled the second film in the Sequel Trilogy.","true":true}
