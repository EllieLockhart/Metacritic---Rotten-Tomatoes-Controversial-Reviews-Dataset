Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Super fun\\, lots of excitement and throwback references.  Great follow up to Force Awakens.  As a Star Wars super fan i'm really enjoying the addition to the series and willing to overlook a couple of cheesy bits.  And just give John Williams the oscar now.","true":true}
