Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are spoilers in this for those who still want to see it.\\n\\nI want to rate this movie higher. I really do. I am still trying to convince myself that this movie was somehow really good\\, or that I am somehow incorrect in my opinion. That I can understand the people saying it was amaaazing. But I can't. I'm giving it 2.5 because that is the most I can possibly give it if I'm stretching it. But this movie was incredibly disappointing. Throughout the first half of the movie\\, I was waiting for it to get really good. I waited through corny dialogue\\, stupid resurrections\\, and some editing transitions that look like they came straight from windows movie maker\\, wondering how much time was left for the movie to make an amazing comeback\\, but it didn't. I will admit\\, there were some good moments. Learning why Ben turned to the dark side\\, what motivated Luke to cause it\\, a small portion of the comedy\\, and some parts of Rey's journey with Luke. But there was far more bad. Leia suddenly using the force and flying to the ship seemed like a cop-out. Kylo not changing at all\\, erasing all sympathy created for him that we didn't have at all before the movie\\, making his story negligible. The casino scene. *shudders*. I don't think this movie was as bad as it could have been. I don't think Luke's story was that bad. I thought that the force image fight between him and Kyle was a cool showdown despite Luke not being in any danger (even though he died\/became one with the force directly after)\\, and think that Rey being incredibly powerful is a cool plot point not just her being a Mary sue. I just think it could have\\, and should have\\, been soooo much better.","true":true}
