Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"God forsaken mess.\\n\\nPoe was totally mistreated in this movie\\, because somebody wouldn't tell him the plan\\, and later the actual plan was incredibly retarded\\, and Leah's approval of the plan simply means she's an idiot.\\nAlso at the beginning\\, Poe only failed because somebody decided the Y-Wings no longer need to exist in Star Wars.\\nAnd honestly i don't believe Poe is stupid enough to launch a reckless assault like that\\, when the remaining Resistance is at risk\\, the survival of the Resistance is simply more important then some dreadnought.\\n\\nThe one that got it worst was obviously Luke\\, honestly the best defense for Luke's character change i have heard is the \\\"it's been 30years\\\" excuse\\, but guess what\\, it doesn't work here either.\\nIn this movie\\, it was made clear that this \\\"pseudo Luke\\\" was contemplating getting rid of Ren \\\"before\\\" he completely turns\\, here's the thing if Luke was contemplating getting rid of Ren even at that point\\, why the F would he run away after he actually turns.\\nSo not only does this movie character assassinates original Luke\\, but also assassinates this new Pseudo Luke as well.  :'-D\\nAnd this is to say nothing of the lack of character change in Leah and Solo.\\n\\nThen there's the \\\"breaking the cycle\\\" plot that underlines the entire movie\\, it was simply the illusion of ending a cycle\\, you still have the First Order\\, you still have the Rebels\\, you still have the Sith\/Darkside\\, you still have the Jedi\/lightside\\, they didn't break sh%t.\\nHell\\, this can clearly be seen when Yoda burns down the Temple even though the books inside the temple were already taken by Rey\\, so burning the place down was meaningless.\\n\\nAnd Luke's \\\"sacrifice\\\" didn't inspire sh%t\\, because he wasn't even there\\, the reason he died reminds me of how Padme died in the prequels\\, which was F'ing stupid as well\\, (\\\"she lost the will to live\\\"\\, you have sci-fi tech and she has kids to take care of\\, how the F did losing the will to live actually kill her\\, how did she even lose the will to live).\\n\\nA lot of TLJ defenders try to split communities and make it seem like the casual fans don't care and the hardcore fans are small and meaningless\\, my response to this is that Star Wars isn't the Fast&Furious nor is it The Transformers\\, also i am getting a serious (2016) Ghostbusters vibe from this fanbase excuse.\\nAlso\\, even if the casual fanbase excuse did hold up\\, we found out from The Transformers: The Last Knight\\, that even the casual of the casuals have standards.\\n\\nRose was probly one of the most forced characters i have seen since that forced love interest in the recent The Mummy movie.\\nShe may as well be a part of the background.\\nAnd then it's revealed she's actually a love interest as well\\, which is insanely stupid\\, there was literally no development of even a solid friendship.\\nDefinitely not enough for that suicidal \\\"gotta save my man\\, F the Rebellion\\\" ramming that she did.\\n\\nFinn was mostly ok in this movie\\, it's not until he's decided to sacrifice himself that i believed they F'ed up'\\nI mean Finn is not the self sacrificial type\\, this was well established even in this very movie when he met Rose.\\nHe'll help if there is a chance\\, but if there's no chance than he pulls out\\, his priority is self preservation.\\n\\nAnd Rey is still a Mary Sue\\, despite an attempt to un-Mary Sue her.\\nBecause even if \\\"the Force rises\\\" and gives her power\\, it still doesn't mean she would know how to used said power\\, much less masterfully wield it.\\nJust because you have a great sword doesn't mean you can properly use it.\\nBetter yet\\, just because you have muscles doesn't mean you know how to fight. \\nAnd no\\, 2\/3 days of training or (for those who are using the \\\"timeline\\\" excuse) 3 lesson\\, aren't worth sh%t.\\n\\nOverall this was simply an egotistical director who wanted to destroy everything to make way for his grand delusional vision.\\nAnd the Studio gave there blessing so long as they can force their politics into the movie too.\\n\\nSome say Johnson was reinventing Star Wars\\, he didn't reinvent a damn thing\\, it was a scorched earth operation.\\nHis message to the fans\\, casual or otherwise was: F Star Wars\\, i am gonna do my own thing.\\nAnd the fan response was: F you then.\\n\\nAt least the special affects were good.\\n\\nHalf star.","true":true}
