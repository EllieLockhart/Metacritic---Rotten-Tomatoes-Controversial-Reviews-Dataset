And although not much has changed and some people argue that there is not much innovation to detect: why fix something that isn\u2019t broken?The stealth aspect of the game and the A.I. of the enemies remain still very well implemented. This leads to some very interesting battles and epic fights. Most of the times intelligent and tactical planning is what\u2019s required\\, sometimes you just need blazing guns and every resource you can find to survive. Item crafting possibilities have been expanded to some degree. Some new enemy types have been introduced.While playing the game\\, I did experience doubt and aversion at times about the directions the story pushed me in as a player. That being said\\, in the end it all made sense. At the end of my first playthrough\\, I understood what the writers were pointing out to and what insights they meant to provide me. Taking such bold moves and choices in the storyline to implicitely deliver the messages (eg. revenge will get you nowhere)  deserves credit. Especially since the game\u2019s story works as a mirror to you as a player. It challenges your own feelings and dispositions. I therefore think the storywriting is actually quite solid. Just like the first game the story delivers an emotional experience and at times really pulls you into it. In comparison to the first game\\, the story arch is a bit less straightforward and deliberately split up into two distinctive parts and timelines. Therefore it can be a bit more confusing than the first game.Graphics are simply stunning and pushing the ps4 to its limits. Sound design is brilliant. Especially when playing using a headphone\\, new levels of sound details can be found.Finally the designers have put lots of effort in accessibility of the game for people with visual- or other physical impairments.Of course the games also has some flaws: some of the fights can become a bit tedious and repetetive\\, especially towards the end. Also\\, I think the game could have been a bit shorter. Yes I mean that\\, 20-25 hours max would have been just as fine. On some occasions there were some dialogues that were either unnecessary or took a strange turn. At some points characters popped up or left quite suddenly with no good or believable explanation.All in all I honestly think this game deserve a very solid 8 at least. Pushing it to a 9 here to compensate somewhat for the unfair review bomb\\, mainly based on leaked footage and people\u2026 Expand","true":true}
