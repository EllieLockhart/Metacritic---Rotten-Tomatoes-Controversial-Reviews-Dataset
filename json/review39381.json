Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is magnificent from beginning to end. As a lifelong Star Wars fan\\, I was blown away by where Director Rian Johnson took the story and I'm eager to see Kylo and Rey's new adventure in Episode IX. 2019 cannot get here soon enough!","true":true}
