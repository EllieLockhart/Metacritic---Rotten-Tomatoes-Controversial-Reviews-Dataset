The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The gameplay is an upgraded version of the part 1. It integrates a few new features like dodging and crouching and creeping (and you are still 100% available to do things while doing it).\r\rYou can upgrade your character and your weapons\\, (as you can on the previous game).\rThe graphics are very good and the animations are gorgeous.\r\u00bfWhy i'm giving it a 2 then?... Because of the story... That fk piece of s*** caused me to hate this game and it took away all my craving for replaying it.\r\rThe ending is just a part of the problem\\, and not the problem itself. The game tries to represent that \\\"vengance is bad\\\"... But let me be clear. It tries to do that by not taking revenge against someone that already took revenge... With Joel\\, killing him at the start of the game.\r\rDon't take me wrong\\, Joel had it coming from what he did on the previous game\\, but doing the people wait YEARS to kill the protagonist of the previous game at the start of this game... It's just a nonsense.\r\rI'm gonna talk about how this game tries to convince you of not taking revenge because vengance is bad and nothing good comes from it.\rEllie does not kill the assassin of Joel\\, (which was Abby). But does not matter if she does or doesn't kill Abby\\, the plot hole is still there.\rHow so?... Well Abby took revenge of Joel\\, and Ellie didn't with Abby... That means that nothing bad came from Abby's vengance\\, woohoo -> Plothole (since nothing bad came from vengance).\r\rNow lets think on the hypothetical situation of Ellie taking revenge on Abby and killing her... Now Abby's dead\\, woohoo -> Plot hole\\, since nothing bad came from vengance.\rNow lets think on the other hypothetical situation... Abby takes revenge on Joel and Ellie takes revenge on Abby... BUT\\, then the partner of Abby wakes up from the boat and kills Ellie\\, and nothing bad happens to him\\, woohoo -> Plot hole again\\, since nothing bad came from vengance.\r\rIt doesn't really matter what you do\\, vengance it's still there and the plot hole too. What the **** they are actually trying to represent with \\\"vengeance being bad\\\".\r(Also\\, Ellie didn't took revenge on Abby and still lost her girlfriend by trying to do it... Oh\\, and two of her fingers too\\, preventing her from playing the guitar song that Joel teached her).\r\rNow im going to actually enumerate which contributions this game does to the \\\"The last of Us\\\" Universe. Ready?\r- Joel dies.\r- Tommy (Joel's brother) gets blind from an eye.\r- Ellie's friend Jesse dies.\r- Ellie's girlfriend Dina almost dies\\, and breaks with Ellie leaving her.\r- Ellie loses 2 fingers.\r* (An everything it's caused by Abby\\, the one that Ellie let go unpunished).\rWow\\, awesome!\\, I can't wait to play this game again and revive all this beatiful moments!.\r\r###########################################\r- This is the case in wich doesn't matter AT ALL if the game it's a 10 on gameplay\\, mechanics\\, animations\\, and soo... Because the story it's SO SO SO Fu***ng bad!\\, that now i'm completely disgusted with it and I prefer to thinkg that it got cancelled and never came out.\r(Now to play The last of us 1\\, to actually revive beatiful moments).\u2026 Expand","true":true}
