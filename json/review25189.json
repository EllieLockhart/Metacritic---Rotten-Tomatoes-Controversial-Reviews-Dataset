Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"New worlds...or reboots of worlds. Interesting cinematography. Story was slow\\, uses characters not communicating to create suspense and tension. New physics are introduced into the star wars universe. Being dead as a force user doesn't mean you cannot interact with the alive world. Some elements built up in previous film are abandoned.","true":true}
