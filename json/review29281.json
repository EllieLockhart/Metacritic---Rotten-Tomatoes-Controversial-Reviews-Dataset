Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rey\\, Luke\\, and Kylo Ren are the only interesting bits of this movie. Finn is tragically underused and undervalued\\, Poe Dameron is made to look like a complete idiot\\, the new Admiral is pink-haired and boring\\, and the new character Rose is the most annoying character ever introduced in the Star Wars franchise. \\n\\nAlso\\, Snoke? What? Why? How?","true":true}
