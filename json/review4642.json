Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Compared to the original trilogy\\, a disaster. Too preachy (weapons manufacturers are greedy capitalists)\\, too Disney (Princess Leia does a Mary Poppins to return to the ship)\\, and too fatalistic (Luke gives up and tunes out the Force).  Lacks the cheeky and youthful spirit of Star Wars\\, the Taoistic mysticism of the Empire Strikes Back\\, and the redemptive conclusion of Return of the Jedi. Compared to the prequels and Disney's other installments\\, it was a triumph.  Time to face it fans -- we will never catch lightening in a bottle again.","true":true}
