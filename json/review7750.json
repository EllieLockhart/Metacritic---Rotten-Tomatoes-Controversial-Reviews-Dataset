Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Excellent film.  Felt like a good middle stanza. Plot twists\\, excitement\\, thrills\\, good acting great special effects. Felt like a star wars movie should but had it's own unique edge. I liked the comedy\\, too. Good allusions towards empire strikes back\\, but not as heavy handed as TFA was to NAH. Ignore the naysayers. They are either fanboys upset that their comic book shop talk theories were wrong\\, or they are the types of people who hate everything. Fantastic film. 9.7\/10","true":true}
