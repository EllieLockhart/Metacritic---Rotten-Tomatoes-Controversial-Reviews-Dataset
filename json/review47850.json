Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where to start ... \\n\\nToo much implausibility. The Dreadnought is supposedly 2.5x bigger than a Star Destroyer\\, and while it has the capacity to track ships through hyperspace\\, somehow it no longer has tractor beam capability? Nor can its weapons blow through the defense shields of a modestly sized rebel ship very low on fuel? This is the entire underpinning of the plot\\, and makes zero sense. \\n\\nToo many characters. Why introduce all these new ones that we barely have time to get invested in\\, and then give short shrift to Maz and Phasma\\, that were introduced with great care in TFA? \\n\\nSpace casino? Done before\\, in 1979\\, by the original Battlestar Galactica (and not the good one)\\, in its 2-hour series premier. The racetrack has the same shape and purpose as Churchill Downs - I felt totally earthbound here. Lucas did this stuff way better\\, imagining\\, for example\\, the space pod race in Ep 1. The holographic chess board in Ep IV. When I go to see a Star Wars film\\, or any good sci fi\\, I don't want to be taken back to Earth\\, with sets\\, creatures\\, scenarios\\, or anything. Did Luke bale hay? No\\, he tended to moisture vaporators. Enough said. \\n\\nI liked the diversity of the cast\\, I liked the meatier role for Leia. (How they will replace her as moral centerpiece of the story thus far\\, I have no idea.) But overall\\, this was a disappointment. Maybe the same person shouldn't have written and directed? Just a thought.","true":true}
