Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very mediocre movie with plotholes and just inconsistency. It doesn't work as a Star Wars movie and much less a normal cohesive film. The only outstanding part are the special effects which always come last to story and characters.","true":true}
