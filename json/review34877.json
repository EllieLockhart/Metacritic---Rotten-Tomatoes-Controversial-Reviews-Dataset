Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The fan hype and theorizing that prefaced The Last Jedi created an environment of anticipation that could never be met. These films are cultural icons\\, beloved by generations that feel possessive of the properties. Instead of fan service\\, director Rian Johnson has created something wholly new that embraces the ethos of Star Wars. Rather than tell the same lessons to the same audience\\, Johnson has added a new chapter that demands a greater level of study than one viewing can provide. ","true":true}
