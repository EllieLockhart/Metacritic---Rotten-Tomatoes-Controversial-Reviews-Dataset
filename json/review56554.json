Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi: How to Ruin Star Wars 101\\nThe ending made me want to yell out in the middle of the theater how angry I was about the direction they chose for the most important character of the franchise\\, not counting the prequels since most people don't. Not to mention one of the major sub plots was just a time filler and would have been unnecessary if a character would have shared their plans with their allies. Was it shot beautifully? Yes. Did it have that Star Wars vibe that every imitates? Yes. But did the story deliver a compelling direction for the franchise going forward? NOPE!!! I can forgive randomly killing off characters throughout the whole movie but when you waste franchise staples just to make room for new characters development there is a problem. If you don't want to use a character you can send them off to some corner of the galaxy or put them in a coma. There are nearly endless possibilities in fiction so why throw them away like yesterday's newspaper? I fundamentally disagree with the creative choices made and I don't even want to watch the next entry in the series anymore.","true":true}
