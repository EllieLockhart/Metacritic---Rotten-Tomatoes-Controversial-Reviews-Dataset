Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No canon at all.\\nWeak characters and dissaponting evolution of the new ones with slow irrelevant plots. Some additions are good. But frankly I don't feel it like a star wars movie.\\nNow I know why Mark Hamill disagreed with director about his character. It's pointless at the grand finale trying to say goodbye to a generation in the worst posible way.","true":true}
