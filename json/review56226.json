Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star wars the last Jedi brings the unexpected\\, but also redefines what a Jedi really is. The movie fits in perfectly in the eight installment of the star wars franchise. It has humor that does not come off as cheesy or added to bring comic relief. I found myself laughing with the audience at these funny moments and enjoying myself. Although TLJ is not a perfect movie\\, it does deliver a fresh take on the mythology of the force and the need to move away from it or \\\"killing the past\\\" in order to move forward. The movie does a great job of General Leia Or \\\"Princess Leia\\\"  character and delivering something that fans \\\"including myself\\\" has always wondered about in this film. The movie does provide some nostalgia that fans of the original trilogy will love and is emotional. This is the second to last of the new trilogy of the star wars saga so it will be very interesting to see how lucasfilm and Disney wrap up the trilogy. I just hope that the last movie is not a rehash of the Return of the Jedi\\, since there are elements to  that movie in this one.","true":true}
