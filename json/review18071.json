Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It hits its stride at points where the action is tense and unpredictable but the majority of the movie is dull\\, non engaging\\, plotless\\, and ultimately disappointing. These new characters are one dimensional and uninteresting. Didn\u2019t leave me craving more at all","true":true}
