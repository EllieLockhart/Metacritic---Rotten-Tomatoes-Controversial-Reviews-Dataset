Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What they did to Luke is unforgivable. The plot\\, pacing boo this film is well below mediocre. Everything introduced as \\\"new\\\" to Star Wars blore just didn't  work. Little character develop. Rey showed zero growth she wasnt really challenged. Kylo is cool\\, Adam Driver is great\\, but not alot to work with. This movie just about killed Star Wars for me. We miss Mr. Lucas\\, sorry for forcing you to sell to white slavers.","true":true}
