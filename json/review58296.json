Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely phenomenal installment to the Star Wars saga. This film really utilizes its long run time to give Star Wars fans a lot to enjoy that we haven\u0092t seen before. The story has many surprising moments that more passive viewers who don\u0092t care to analyze the symbolism on display may not are for. However\\, decoding the symbolism at each major turn\\, you get much more of what is happening and what is yet to come. The Rey\/Ren fight sequence after Rey is given over to Snoke is choreographed with brilliant imagery and symbolism. Luke\u0092s final scene was handled eith unrelenting symbolism as well. Director Rian Johnson made a beautifully crafted film out of a solid script. The fans complaining appear to have a thread of \u0093It\u0092s not what I wanted\u0094\\, but if you\u0092re open to taking what is given to you and judging it on what it is\\, as opposed to what you wanted it to be\\, then it is a fantastic film that deserves a high placement om the list of Star Wars stories.","true":true}
