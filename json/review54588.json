Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not really a Star Wars fan\\, more of an enthusiast so take what I say in that light:\\n\\nThe Good: \\n1. Subversion of expectations on the \\\"mystery box\\\" crap that J.J. Abrams is too committed to. \\n2. Great visuals that blend special and visual effects.\\n3. Effective\\, if not exactly memorable soundtrack.\\n4. Great performances from Hamill and Fisher.\\n\\nThe Bad:\\n1. Some of the pacing is off because of the low speed space chase being intercut with two other plot-lines.\\n2. Some of the CGI looked awkward\\, but not so bad as too ruin scenes.\\n3. Leans a bit to heavily on the structure and even scenes from Empire and the other movies. \\n\\nThe Ugly:\\n1. Too many jokes that fall flat and muddy the tone of the film.\\n2. Plot-lines that literally come to nothing.\\n3. Far too much violation of the \\\"show don't tell\\\" maxim of screenwriting to the point that you feel like Rian Johnson thinks that the audience is a bunch of distracted toddlers.\\n4. Character arcs that make no sense or fizzle out.\\n5. Dialogue that conveys a message that directly contradicts the message we get from things shown in the film.\\n6. Overall cringey try-hard tone in the writing.\\n\\nIf you like this movie\\, that's cool. Just don't try to convince me that it is brilliant or intellectual. It is neither. No movie needs to be brilliant for you to like it.","true":true}
