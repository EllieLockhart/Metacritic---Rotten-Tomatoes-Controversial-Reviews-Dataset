Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"THE worst Star Wars movie\\, it felt more like Guardians of the Galaxy clashed with Harry Potter in Star Wars costumes.\\n\\nCritical reviewers must have been bought off by Disney\\, practices from the gaming industry coming to cinema.\\n\\nThe only thing it did well was look good for the sake of looking good (Salt planet\\, Snoke's chambers).\\n\\nThis will be the last Star Wars movie I will be seeing on the big screen.","true":true}
