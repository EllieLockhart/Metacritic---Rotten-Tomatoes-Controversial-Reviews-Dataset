Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing 2.5 hours.  So much waste of great characters.  Snoke was wasted.  Rey was wasted.  And of course\\, Luke was wasted.  From the youngest to the oldest in my group that watched it together (55-12) we were all disappointed. \\n\\nMy perspective was that Leia is stronger with The Force than Luke. I mean\\, what the hell was that???  Was that Superman frozen in space resurrected by the sun or a novice Force user floating around like Peter Pan.  Now that was one of the few since that had me laughing out loud. And it was unintentional.  Then Luke puffs away after seeing an extra sun show up in that solar system remarkably??? Omg what a joke.","true":true}
