Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The sad thing is Ep 9 is supposed to close out all 9 movies. It's supposed to be an all out conclusion to the Star Wars we know before beginning the next (unrelated) trilogy. Ep 7 the way it is should have never happened. Ep 7 should have been the beginning of the 3 part conclusion to Star Wars. It could have been so much better. Like I saw on another video they could bring back everyone on the light side to battle Snoke. Anakin (who could possibly turn Kylo back to the light)\\, Obi Wan\\, Yoda Qui-Gon\\, and many others in Ep 9 closing out what could have been the ultimate ending to a great story. I can't see how they can do anything dealing with an ending worth what the original trilogy and prequels deserve. I wish they could wipe these last two films from the story and begin again at Ep. 7. Made for the fans without agendas that trump story. It's all around disappointing.","true":true}
