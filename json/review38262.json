Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Whole movie is just a slow paced chase\\, characters in weird situation\\, worthless deaths just because Rian Johnson big god like ego puts believes that can do weather he want with Star wars characters and still people like the movie. Good reason why director should not be the only writer of same film\\, not sure if J.J. Abrams can fix this one.","true":true}
