Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok. Never thought i'd add a review here\\, but when you RUIN one's favourite childhood saga......\\n\\nNot much to add since all's been allready written. \\nIts an average scifi movie to watch at home with your kids\\, but as star wars it completely SUCKS. \\nLoved the Originals\\, liked the prequels\\, found ep7 ok-ish (not much originality\\, also the Rey character showed some of the superhero signs we had to bear at ep8 \\, but at least it felt like star wars\\, and kept you waiting for stuff to come). \\nOnly thing disney cared about seems to be how she could get rid of the old characters as soon as possible (without the respect they deserved) only to add new ones who will again sell products. \\nWell\\, they failed! None of them will\\, cause none of them gets even close to being even likable to the audience .  \\n\\nAnd of course there is the whole politics thing...dam' you disney!!!!\\nIncomplete gooffy male characters\\, women who need noone and are perfect in every way taking fun in sh**ting over males (how much you must hate men KK bit*h) Chewie turns vegan\\, maybe even luke if he had survived meditation\\, he looked pretty embarassed taking that green animal product...capitalism (seriously now\\, disney??)..freeing animals (but not kids!!!... well i guess someone gotta make those cheap disney SW toys somewhere in Asia\\, right??!!!)\\n\\nWill not give one $ for next SW productions that apparently will keep coming once a year\\, even if they try to     clean their mess up\\, when they see the financial results ......damage done!\\n\\nOh\\, and dont make me started on the critics issue...at least now we know.\\nAnd when all those fake 5star (1 line \\\"great movie. Over\\\") audience reviews stop eventually\\, this crap will get ehat it deserves...\\n\\nRIP SW...","true":true}
