Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can forgive dumb things like bombs in zero gravity\\, because star wars is space opera and has always played fast and loose with science\\, but the real problem here is that the story is nonsensical to the point that it's insulting to the audience.  I'm glad that I waited to see it on netflix\\, that way I was able to fast forward through the more tedious parts (which BTW were where the climax of the story should have been).","true":true}
