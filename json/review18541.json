Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is written and directed by some guy whom knows nothing about the universe. Watching the movie was insulting\\, it tries to wow the viewer with shallow and empty twists and subversions. To add insult to injury all humor bits fell flat. It also is totally inconsistent with the known lore of its own universe\\, but that is to be expected from a hackfraud like rian jhnson. This movie is a pure reaction to the criticism in TFA without doing anything better in its own right\\, ironically. The characters have nothing to do\\, they learn nothing and the new additions are unlikeable. Most importantly it completely blew the trilogy\\, go watch the OT instead.","true":true}
