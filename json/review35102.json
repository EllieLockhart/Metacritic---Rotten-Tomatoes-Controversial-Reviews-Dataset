{"101487":174491,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-28","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first was bland and played safe\\, and the rest of the trilogy could go any which way with it\\, while this second movie is a train-wreck. It effectively killed off this trilogy\\, and the franchise as a whole by also including the original heroes in there last moments\\, completely out of character\\, ridiculous\\, and pathetic. Not to mention the utter disrespect and contempt for the story and audience oozing from this general plot? Who is Rei? can anyone answer this question? likes? dislikes? personality? at least luke was optimistic tri-hard hero\\, and he faced some hard truths in the second chapter\\, rei has done nothing so far\\, except win without trying or training. How does she know to mind control people\\, or pull lightsabres\\, she wasnt trained by luke\\, she just meditated\\, and went into the dark hole\\, which accomplished nothing and had no meaning to the rest of the movie. Rose and Fin\\, my god\\, imagine han solo suddenly walking off with a new character\\, have the most ridiculous plot armor concievable\\, and come back accomplishing nothing\\, well here you go. Luke \\\"ima kill my nephew while he sleeps\\\" skywalker\\, doesnt die couragously\\, or tragically\\, but dies anyways. Every death was intentionally sucked out of any meaning\\, even though the movie keeps wasting time with glimpses of things you'll have to buy videogames and novels to understand. Every spacebattle in every movie before this should just have everyone crashing into each other in warp drives\\, why is everyone parking their cruisers one inch away to let out X-wings? JUST CRASH STAIGHT IN BRO WAY MORE EFFECTIVE. My god\\, how much disrespect and contempt for a fan base\\, let alone the world\\, can you have? I know this is a business\\, but you couldn't have it make sense? Not only that\\, but you clearly rig the critics results\\, no human over the age of 5 likes this movie\\, yet professional adults who study film theory and criticism love it? get outta here with that\\, then you say nazis are botting the site cus they hate women\\, wow\\, so bringing in that shit\\, and ironically playing into there narrative and degrading feminism as whole\\, wth is wrong with you? This is my first review on this site\\, because i was so outraged by this none-sense. So is hundreds upon hundreds\\, I would tell you to feel shame\\, but I know you don't.","true":true}
