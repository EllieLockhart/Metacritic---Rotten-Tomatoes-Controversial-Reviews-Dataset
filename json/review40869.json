Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie could have been better\\, but I don't know why people are asking for JJ Abrahms to come back. The guy (JJ) ruined the casting and created  an unbelievably hokey and unoriginal initial story line of the first movie. Direct your anger at Disney\\, JJ and their greed\\, not Rian Johnson. \\n\\nIn order for Disney to regain it's fans it must do some of the following things:\\n1. Make an Obi-Won movie with no SJW nonsense\\, starring the man\\, the legend\\, Ewan Mcgregor\\, who single handily raised the bar for the prequels. \\n2. Disown JJ Abrams. \\n3. Disown JJ Abrams\\n4. Make a prequel trilogy to this trilogy with Luke Skywalker in it. We all know this will not happen however\\, as it seems Disney only wants strong women to play their roles these days. To bad young women don't give a rats ass about Star Wars (Compared to boys).\\n5. Hire George Lucas for his creative input\\, because no one at Disney has any. \\n6. Disown JJ Abrams\\n\\nI would also like to give a shout out to one of the  \\\"super reviewers\\\" on this website (Carlos Magalh\u00e3es) who gave this piece of crap movie 4.5 stars\\, while giving many classic Hitchcock movies 3 stars. You have bad taste buddy\\, really bad taste.","true":true}
