Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not a huge star wars fan but my husband has been since childhood and had passed his love on to our grandchildren.\\n\\nThis movie was HORRIBLE!!! I certainly hope they redeem themselves in the next one or allot of loyal star wars fans are going to be lost. \\n\\nListen to your fans not your critics..... your fans fill the seats\\, your fans buy your product. Star Wars fans are among the most loyal fans and you will drive everyone of them away.","true":true}
