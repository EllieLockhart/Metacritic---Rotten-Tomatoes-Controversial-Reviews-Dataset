Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Put on your hazmat suit and grab a fistful of air fresheners as we wade through the toxic wasteland that is having an opinion on Star Wars: The Last Jedi.\\n\\nBefore we get into that let's go back to the glorious summer of '99 and The Phantom Menace. A film I remember watching and feeling quite strongly that it sucked but was confused because it was Star Wars. Star Wars is great right? Maybe I didn't understand it. I better pretend I thought it was good so people think I'm cool.\\n\\nThen other people were like \\\"God that was shit\\,\\\" and I embraced them for I had feared I was alone.\\n\\\"Thank you\\,\\\" I said and kissed them on the mouth before being banned from that particular haberdashery. \\\"It's exactly that kind of attitude that led to the decline of the textiles industry!\\\" I shouted before being removed from the shopping centre.\\n\\nBut where my feelings were certain concerning The Phantom Menace\\, The Last Jedi left me genuinely lost. I felt the cinema unsure what had just transpired\\, like a murderer looking quizzically at bloodsoaked hands as the haze fades. The usher ominously whispering \\\"See you in two days\\,\\\" as he passed.\\n\\nAnd he was right. Two days later I was back. The staff recognising my haunted look\\, ushering me into a second smaller screen where everyone was sat forward\\, looking intensely at the screen. No food\\, no drink\\, just an empty two-litre bottle to piss in.\\n\\nSo let's break it down:\\nThere are three main plots in The Last Jedi which we'll call STAR WARS\\, BATTLESTAR RESISTICA and HARRY POTTER AND THE CRIMSON FLOWER. While the first one was a pure joy\\, it was in the other two that my reservations grew.\\n\\nHarry and the gang are all grown up and stuck in the first episode of Battlestar Galactica. The First Order are hot on the heels of La R\u00e9sistance and it's up to Harry and Hermione to get them out of it (Ron's busy dealing with his own challenge: insecurity.)\\n\\nPoe helps them out\\, though he's not playing Harry Potter\\, he's playing 24\\, specifically one of those episodes where the boss gets replaced by some ass-hat and everyone has to plot against them in the corridor or server room.\\n\\nPoe's Jack Bauer calls Maz Kanata's Clo\u00e9 to get some help but she's busy\\, so he gives up and plays Battlefront II while Harry and Hermione wait awkwardly in the corner wondering if he's forgotten they're there. But the game is full of micro-transactions and he left his credit card in his X-Wing\\, so that's bolloxed.\\n\\nWhere were we?\\n\\nOh yeah. So Harry and Hermione are sent to Canto Bight to meet the Keymaker from the Matrix films. But Hermione gets distracted by the plight of House Elves and they get arrested by over zealous traffic cops.\\n\\nAfter a magical escape sequence they decide they can't be bothered with the Keymaker and settle for some vagrant called DJ\\, a man who's named after two letters from the English alphabet. An alphabet doesn't exist in the Star Wars universe except for all the times it does.\\n\\nBack at CTU\\, Jack pulls a mutiny\\, for which he gets a slap on the wrist. A crime Michael Burnam got life in prison for because of... institutional racism?\\n\\nHarry and Hermione infiltrate Snoke's ship but they get caught within jizzing distance of their goal and Dorn-Jenth sells them out to Captain Phasma\\, who is neither demoted to Lieutenant Phasma after folding like an origami crane in the Force Awakens\\, nor promoted to Commander Phasma and justifying the shiny armour.\\n\\nDespite traveling at sunlight speed for two hours\\, someone looks out the window and discovers a planet called Deus Crait Machina\\, where convenience has been good enough to leave behind a old Rebel base.\\n\\nHarry and Hermione return to La R\u00e9sistance having achieved bugger-all. And Hunger Games lady wishes Leia good luck before Kamikaze-ing the shit out of Snoke's ship.\\n\\nMay she rest in peace.\\n(So say we all.)\\n\\nBelow on Deus Crait Machina the First Order take a page out of the Empire's \\\"Shite Battle Strategy\\\" book by landing fifty miles away from La R\u00e9sistance and slowly walking towards them instead of bombarding the living bollox out of them from orbit.\\n\\nLa R\u00e9sistance go out to meet the First Order with shitty old sand speeders\\, and like helicopters in Skull Island\\, lose way more than they went out with.\\n\\nHarry tries to Randy Quaid the First Order's big gun\\, only to ge T-boned by Hermione\\, cementing them both as the most inconsequential characters in movie history... aside from Indiana Jones in Raiders...\\n\\nCredits.\\n\\nSo as I screw the top on a warm bottle of piss and wipe the spillage from the back of my hand\\, where do I stand?\\n\\nThere are nitpicks certainly. Leia's impromptu rendition of Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. The guy who steps out onto Deus Crait Machina leaving a red footprint behind\\, and Garath Edward is freaked out and licks it\\, despite sitting in a trench dug into the same ground. Luke's Zac Snyder-esk slow motion lightsaber dodge. The fact La R\u00e9sistance have detailed schematics to Snoke's ship with no explanation of how many Bothans and\/or Jyn Erso's died to get them. Finn's ability to pass on coma's.\\n\\nBut it was the Harry Potter storyline that grated at me so. But as I left the cinema\\, the staff refusing direct eye contact as I threw away the piss bottle and fist full of tissues\\, I realised that although everything Finn and Rose did was a failure\\, their story was in a film about dealing with the repercussions of our failures.\\n\\nPoe is dealing with the negative effects of his \\\"jump in an X-Wing and blow something up\\\" philosophy. Luke is dealing with the repercussions of a moments poor decision making. AndFinn thinks he's a hero of La R\u00e9sistance\\, forgetting that it took Rey\\, Han and a bacta tank to drag him through the previous film. He\\, Rose and Poe all make choices that cause more harm than good\\, reducing La R\u00e9sistance from thousands of people on three frigates\\, to about twenty huddled together on the Falcon. Actions which are sure to affect them and the story going forward.\\n\\nEverything about Canto Bight is thematically consistent\\, if not tonaly.\\n\\nSo where does that leave us? Probably standing at an observation window of a medical frigate trying to rationalise things to ourselves.\\n\\nThe reaction to The Last Jedi has been split. And it's understandable. It's a movie that takes risks\\, and some of them stumble as they land. But just as those who will blindly wank themselves feral no matter what\\, are annoying. So are those that will sneer for sneerings sake.\\n\\nThose that declare Star Wars dead and the raping of their childhood. Things that could be considered over-reactions to what is essentially a children's film.\\n\\nThose who criticise the speed or lack of Rey's training (depends who you ask)\\, despite... you know.\\n\\nOr a character's inconsequential actions\\, despite... you know.\\n\\nThen there's the character assassination of Luke Skywalker. Despite having him as a fallen hero finding some sort of redemption actually gives him a character arc.\\n\\nRather than just have him as awesome Luke\\, remaining awesome and ending awesome. \\\"What's wrong with that?\\\" I hear you ask. Well nothing\\, apart from that being the basic problem with every Marvel sequel.\\n\\nWhat do I mean? Allow me to demonstrate:\\n\\nWhat's more compelling as a story?\\n\\nIron Man - Tony Stark is a billionaire arms developer who sees the horror wrought by the weapons his empire was built upon\\, and tried to make amends through murder robboting. Or...\\nIron Man 2 - Tony Stark owns a murder robot. He proceeds to murder people with said murder robot for two hours. Ends owning a murder robot.\\n\\nOr how about:\\n\\nThor - Thor\\, son of Odin is a self-centred prick. Starts a war and is grounded. Sent to Earth to learn humility\\, compassion\\, self-sacrifice and the proper technique for ordering coffee.\\nThor: The Dark World - Thor is Thor. Thors some shit and ends as Thor.\\n\\nSo\\, is that what you want? Rey finds him and he's all like \\\"'Sup girl. You want the Force?\\\" so she backs away nervously. After that misunderstanding is all cleared up Luke and Rey just chill out. He shows her some sweet kickflips\\, murks Kylo without breaking a sweat and sends Rey on her way\\, slapping her ass as she goes. Giving her a Fonz style thumbs up before becoming one with the Force.\\n\\nIs that what you want? Really?\\n\\nI'd rather have inner turmoil\\, struggle and conflict. After all\\, that's how Drama is supposed to work isn't it?\\n\\nSo\\, if you truly think Star Wars is dead\\, go deep into the woods with all your Star Wars things and make a funeral pyre. Let the flames lick high as John Williams swells in the background.\\n\\nThose who simply didn't like it\\, well maybe the next one will have the balance you need.\\n\\nI for one found it fine. Intriguing even. And I don't have any problems with female leads\\, or people of colour\\, or heroes struggling with the ghosts of their past.\\n\\nUnless it's a female person of colour struggling with the ghosts of her past. That shit is terrifying.","true":true}
