Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Personaly I like the movie. I think it was a bit better than The Force Awakens. There was an action\\, emotions and some surprising moments\\, just as I expected. Everybody did a good job. But I have to reproach some things\\, for example SPOILERS: dry humour or  Snoke's rushed death\\, they could've open up his character more. Anyway there were things that I really enjoyed\\, for example Yoda's appearance\\, it was really great to see this tiny man with his wiseness again\\, even if it was for a short time. Space battle\\, that Force conection between Kylo and Rey and I can't forget Luke's jedi trick that he used at the end\\, it was awesome! Btw. Poor Hux","true":true}
