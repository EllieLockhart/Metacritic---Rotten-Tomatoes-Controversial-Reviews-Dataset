Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If I have the option to give it a quarter star I'd do it. It's justa pointless movie made to offer only new toys\\, new fanfictions and a lot of sickness for old fans.","true":true}
