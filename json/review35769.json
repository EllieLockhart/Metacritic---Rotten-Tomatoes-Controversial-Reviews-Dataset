Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is exactly what you'd expect from a cheesy space movie\\, nothing more nothing less\\, and that's good. As with every other movie in the franchise the story isn't the most brilliant\\, the whole \\\"Space Leia\\\" scene was particularly awful and they missed several opportunities to finish off her character in a memorable way\\, but overall The Last Jedi does it's job pretty well at delivering solid entertainment.","true":true}
