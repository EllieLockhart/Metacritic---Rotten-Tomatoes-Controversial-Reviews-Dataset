Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An uneven but great addition to the lore and story of Star Wars. As many others have said\\, it takes what you know and expect and turns it on its head. I look forward to Episode IX and what Rian Johnson has in store for us. ","true":true}
