We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Some positives but the game was rarely enjoyable - And not for the reason being publicised (joels death).In of itself killing off the previous games main character isn't the worst decision in the world. However\\, the story line and forced nature of the plot when it comes to 'educating' the audience on the rights & wrongs of revenge\\, and the morality behind why we should be inclusive borders on ridiculous \/ boring.A character from the 1st game (tommy) had a ton of potential to be further explored\\, but was rarely seen. When he was on screen tended to be portrayed as wrong in any given circumstance\\, and generally unimportant - The same could be said for new character jesse\\, who it also seemed had a ton of potential but was miss-used.The introduction of Abby as a playable character is an interesting concept\\, but in execution was awful (imho). It killed the narrative structure (both times) JUST as I thought the story might be recapturing the intensity and emotion of the 1st game. The voice actor did a decent job but her characters dialogue & attitude did nothing to make me warm to her.When it comes to gameplay the introduction of being able to crawl helps to improve stealth mechanics\\, as does the ability to jump for escaping certain situations. Other than this the gameplay felt identical to the 1st game - my one sore spot when it came to the last of us 1\\, as it is far too 'clunky' specifically when shooting & swapping weapons etc.The selection of weapons on offer\\, as well as the shooting mechanic itself is extremely lackluster. Ammo is scarce to the point you are lucky if you have enough to win a skirmish without running laps around the map to regain a stealthy position - Its then Rinse and repeat with another 4-6 bullets.Stealth kills are enjoyable and gritty as ever\\, on both the living and the dead\\, which brings me to my next point.The most enjoyable fight was playing as abby in the hospital when you are confronted with a ridiculous bloater  in an enclosed\\, but free flowing underground space - MORE OF THIS IS NEEDED. All in all there were some okay gameplay\\, and fantastic graphical improvements compared to the last of us 1\\, but when it comes to the general storyline and narrative choices i fail to think of a bigger disappointment.Sometimes good\\, but never great - 4\/10. In case I'm being overly critical here are some ratings I'd give other games:The last of us 1 - 9\/10Days gone - 7.5\/10Rdr2 - 9.5\/10Gta 5 - 8.5 \/10Horizon zero dawn - 8\/10Dying light - 7 \/10Far cry 5 - 6.5\/10Far cry 4 - 7.5\/10g\u2026 Expand","true":true}
