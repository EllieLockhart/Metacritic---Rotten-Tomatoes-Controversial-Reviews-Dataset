Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is a difference between \\\"doing something different\\\" and fundamentally changing what makes a series what it is. This movie is not Star Wars. It wasted the incredible potential that was set up in The Force Awakens\\, and throws them down the drain. Rian Johnson should be ashamed. I am absolutely perplexed by how anyone enjoys this movie. What they did to Luke was a travesty. The plot was like from a daytime TV show. Nothing actually happened. A slow speed chase\\, that's it? Embarrassing. They reduced Hux to a punchline\\, they killed Snoke\\, and Kylo is an interesting character\\, but he doesn't feel like a threatening villain. Therefore\\, there is essentially no real villain left. This movie is complete garbage. Please do not see it\\, we need to send a message that making something like this is inexcusable.","true":true}
