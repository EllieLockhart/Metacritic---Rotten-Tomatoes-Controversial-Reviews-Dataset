{"101487":182878,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-31","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the best Star Wars movie I've seen so far. It's on par with The Empire Strikes Back\\, in my humble opinion\\, and even after reading all the possible articles and review about this film I stgill haven't been able to make sense of the reason (if there is a reason) behind the review bombing that has vbasically killed TLJ's Audience Score.\\nGranted\\, I've been a fan of Star Wars since I was a kid\\, and my favorite movies in the franchise have changed as I grew up. At first it was Revenge of the Sith\\, because it was the first I ever saw (blame my parents for not giving a damn about watching movies in the correct order) and had one of the greatest lightsaber battles of all time\\, but then as I entered high school and became really interested in films and filmmaking the Original Trilogy became the Holy Trinity of movies in my eyes\\, with TESB at the top because of its break away from what would become the Star Wars formula. \\nSince I had been hearing that this movie would do the same thing\\, I was greatly excited before seeing it--but also afraid it would end up too similar to TESB. The Force Awakens had been already pretty similar to the original Star Wars\\, but it had had at least (in my opinion) more rounded characters and greater themes (legends vs truth\\, refusal of the call out of fear\\, conflict between light and dark in a new character\\, and so on). I had also been a bit turned off by its complete rejection of the old Legends continuity. Ironically\\, this movie's arc words are 'Let the past die'.\\nI think it's a great metaphor for the Sequel Trilogy overall. Many people are mad that the last two movies have been killing off beloved OT characters and introducing new and diverse ones\\, but stories need to evolve in order to become timeless. Luke Skywalker's death in this movie is perhaps the best example of this truth. His last stand against the First Order in order to give the Resistance time to escape may have costred him his life\\, but it also elevated him to a legend in his universe's eyes and in ours (just by how awesome and heartwrenching it is)\\, serving as inspiration for everyone both in the movie and (we can only hope) our own world.\\nThis movie also deals with the theme of failure\\, something rarely dealt with in Star Wars movies. Yoda (puppet Yoda!) himself comes out of the afterlife to give us all a lesson on it\\, and it is beautiful (not to mention hilarious\\, but for other reason). It also deconstruct the one-in-a-million scheme that Star Wars has helped popularize since its very first chapter\\, by making both Poe's mutiny and Rose and Finn's plan fail just like they would in real life. It's a harsh reminder of what the world is really like\\, but it's something that Star Wars needed after forty years of uttter optimism. It adds a whole new dimension to the films\\, and also helps us learn this lesson by making us first empathize with these characters and then making them learn from their failures. It is also the first time in a Star Wars movie in which a darksider refuses to return to the light.\\nOverall\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a brilliant and intelligent movie. It is unfortunately saddled by a bland casino subplot\\, but it more than makes up for it with its other strenghts.\\n4.8\/5","true":true}
