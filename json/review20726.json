Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I walked out of the theater feeling satisfied\\, but after a few days of contemplation I realized that Disney succeeded in accomplishing a near-impossible feat: they actually managed to polish a turd. Looks great\\, sounds great\\, even feels great at first...but when you strip away all the trimmings and glossy overcoat - you find one of the most absurd\\, nonsensical\\, soulless\\, universe-destroying piles of dung in cinema. The Last Jedi feels nothing like a Star Wars movie\\, and now I'm left feeling like\\, when all is said and done\\, the new trilogy will pale in comparison to the prequels.","true":true}
