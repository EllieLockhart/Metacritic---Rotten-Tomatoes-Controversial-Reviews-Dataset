Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very uneven.  Some sequences mind blowing and cinematic while others were very tedious to sit through. So many glaring mistakes that have obvious fixes\\, its a wonder to me how THIS was the final cut. A lot of time wasted.","true":true}
