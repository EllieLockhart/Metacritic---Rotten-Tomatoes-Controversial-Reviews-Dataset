Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was blown away. I got from TLJ what I desperately wanted from TFA (though I get why that film played it safe).\\n\\nIt continued the story in an original way without dismantling the canon or ruining the important concepts of how the Force works.\\n\\nEvery character had a role within the complex philosophical and mythological messages that were being told.\\n\\nThe concept of the Jedi wasn't overridden but expanded - the scene with Yoda putting everything into context and making the old Jedi master\\, my favourite character\\, as wonderful and inspiring as ever.\\n\\nThe scene with Rey\\, Ren\\, Snoke and the guards is in my top 3 along side the Yoda scenes on dagobah and Vader's redemption.\\n\\nThe Luke vs Kylo scene is the most beautiful scene I've seen committed to celluloid.\\n\\nAnd I have never been so pumped in a SW movie as I have in this one\\, to the point I was letting out squeals of delight! The Rey\/Ren fight. The Falcon on crait with OT music. Luke vs Ren. I haven't reacted like that since Yoda flipped out his saber vs dooku and sidious - and this time it was amplified a hundred fold!\\n\\nI literally cannot fault this film. Even the bits I \\\"didn't like\\\"\\, I loved for being so daring and fresh. I embraced everything.\\n\\nI've fallen in love with SW afresh.","true":true}
