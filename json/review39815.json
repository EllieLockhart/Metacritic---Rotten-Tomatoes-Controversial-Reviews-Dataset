Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a pretty weak Star Wars film. The story to me was bunch of sub plots stringed together with a bunch action scenes. There was not much character development from any character. I only part I found interesting was when Rey and Kylo Ren communicated through the force. That was it.","true":true}
