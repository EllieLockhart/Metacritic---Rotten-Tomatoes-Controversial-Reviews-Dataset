Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"It'a Trap\\\"\\n\\nSo currently critics have this movie at over 90%.\\n\\nI can honestly say I didn't enjoy a single part of this movie\\, not a single part.\\n\\nWho is Snook and what will he bring = nothing to see here\\nWow Rey must have an interesting background  = nah nothing again.\\n\\nNo need for Fin Fin binks either\\, his entire side plot provides nothing to the overall story\\, in fact take out his parts completely and the ending would be exactly the same. His comic relief is poor and clumsy and his love story is so bad the final kiss came from nothing and gave the exact amount of emoshional payout.\\n\\nIt's good to see that males don't take part in the rebel alliance any more\\, to the level that the main command scene looks like the cast of loose women \/ the view.\\n\\nCould have and should have been so much better.","true":true}
