Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best movie-going experiences I have ever had. It made me believe in not only the emotive power of visual storytelling but the importance of going to the cinema and sharing with so many others something truly remarkable. Thank you Rian Johnson for taking the helm of this film. You have breathed new life into the series. It was something like magic - inventive\\, hysterical\\, unexpected\\, and simply beautiful. I am thrilled to see what is to come with your own trilogy. Well done and good luck.","true":true}
