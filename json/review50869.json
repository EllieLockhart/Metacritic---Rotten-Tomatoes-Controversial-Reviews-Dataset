Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"About a quarter of the way into The Last Jedi\\, I turned to my husband and said \\\"I've got a bad feeling about this.\\\"  Sigh\\, I was right.  This movie stunk.  Old characters were neglected and new characters were awful.  The plot was boring and some of the cheesiest parts of any movie I've ever seen were in this movie.  It was as bad as the honest fans are saying it was.  The rest are either bought off or delusional.","true":true}
