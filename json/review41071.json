Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had no purpose! I\u2019m so disappointed. They create problems just so the characters have something to do which creates other sub plots that fizzle out to nothing. It took Luke days of training and hard work to make a rock float but now Rey can lift a whole mountain side? Come on!! And now the sniveling apprentice who needs much training is the supreme leader? Why did they even bother putting Snoke in this series in the first place? And don\u2019t get me started on Leia doing the Peter Pan flight through space! There are so many problems with this movie I could go on and on. Rogue one is still the best!!!","true":true}
