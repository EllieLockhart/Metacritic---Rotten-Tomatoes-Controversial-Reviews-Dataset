Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Incredible movie in my opinion. I watched it a second time around and it's my number two favorite behind only Episode 5. I believe the reason behind the hate is because people were so firmly planted on how they wanted it to turn out\\, they weren't willing to accept the drastic changes. This is definitely the most creative Star Wars film in years\\, and I love the new direction they're taking it. If you're hesitant on seeing it due to the reviews\\, certainly watch if for yourself with an open mind. If you're still debating if you liked it\\, definitely see it again as I did. To all the people saying it \\\"ruined your childhood\\\"\\, it's not 1977 anymore\\, and it's time Star Wars as a franchise moved on. Just like when Empire was released\\, I personally think everyone will see how great it is after time passes. And it seems to me like the majority of people who appreciated it were the ones old enough to have seen the OT as a child\\, whereas the haters are the younger \\\"fans.\\\" The Last Jedi was absolutely incredible\\, and if you hop on the internet just to give it a half star review\\, you'll never see how meaningful this movie truly is.","true":true}
