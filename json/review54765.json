Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It breaks my heart to say it because I've loved all Star Wars films since I was a child\\, but that changed with this movie. I don't know why critics assumed fans would like this film; I can only guess they're not savvy to the Star Wars fandom. I'm also not sure where they get the idea that the story telling is decent as it is easily some of the worst I have seen in a movie. This is a sequel allegedly but you could easily not watch the Force Awakens as it throws all of the established plot threads and character personalities out the window to do its own thing. Its own thing being gaping plot holes in the star wars lore\\, badly written characters and pacing that baffles common sense.\\n\\nVisually it is stunning. But cleaning a toilet doesn't change the fact it is still a toilet. It is watchable\\, but I cannot watch it without shaking my head in frustration. This was the film that needed to answer questions so we could be excited for the final instalment in this new trilogy. Instead it wastes time and gives answers that carry little weight. Somewhere between the stolen motifs of the original trilogy and thoughtless meandering\\, the film lost itself. It is upsetting to see such a beloved franchise placed in the hands of people who do not understand it\\, The Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise is but a shadow when compared to the Tragedy of the Last Jedi and what it could have been.","true":true}
