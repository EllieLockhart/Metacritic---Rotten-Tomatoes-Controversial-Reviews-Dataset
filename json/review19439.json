Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's suppose to be science fiction\\, yes. But omg\\, the pacing of this movie is too crappy needless to say. How can this get 91% is beyond me. Sure the vfx is great and all but the writing is too cheesy it become laughable","true":true}
