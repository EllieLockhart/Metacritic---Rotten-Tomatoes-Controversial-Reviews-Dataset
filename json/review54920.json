Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's not a bad movie overall to begin with\\, it does has its gripping moments\\, the thrills\\, the humors\\, the surprises and bit of everything else that being squeezed into a 2 1\/2 hours movie journey to the audience.  But it lacks some of the climax moments found in The Force Awaken that could really made me grabbed my seat and hold my breath.  And then there are some major flaws in the plots of the movie being presented\\, or should I say totally being mishandled that left the entire audiences bewildered.  I just want to point out a few things\\, I mean\\, they are really hitting my nerves..  WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD -\\n\\nHow could you killed off Snoke just like that?? I mean he is the key villain in the previous movie\\, this mysterious powerful figure who lead the First Order\\, the master of the Dark side of The Force - being cut in half in a split second scene\\, he's gone!  With all the hypes building up on his identity to be revealed in this movie\\, he's being written off just like that? WTH !!? Are you kidding me ??\\nAt least we got to see him wielding a lightsaber dueling scene with both Kylo and Rey\\, fighting his way through or at least die with honor ??  This part is seriously poorly executed and a huge disappointment to me.  Well as some fans have speculated Snoke may not be really dead and could return in the next episode but that's not the point here..  And then there's this final show down scene between Kylo and Luke\\, I was expecting something grand and can really push the entire movie to its climax\\, but ended up completely flat... Except maybe the humor part when Luke brush off his shoulder\\, that's the only moment of brilliance in the entire scene..  Other than that it's another part poorly executed. \\n\\nWith all being said\\, I love the Star Wars series of movies but this latest installment turn out to be rather disappointing\\, a few clueless twist of plots that left many fans in jaw dropping awe\\, seriously less satisfying and still\\, looking forward to the next and final chapter.","true":true}
