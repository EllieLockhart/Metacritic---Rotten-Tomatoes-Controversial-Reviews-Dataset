Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Remember when you were a  kid and you were excited to get a Luke Skywalker action figure for Christmas and instead you got a cheap overseas knock off \\\"Duke Spacewalker Lazer Sword Action Man\\\"?   Remember that punch in the guts feeling as you mumbled a thank you to your parents?  Well bucko\\, that's how you're going to feel walking out of the theatre after watching The Last Jedi.","true":true}
