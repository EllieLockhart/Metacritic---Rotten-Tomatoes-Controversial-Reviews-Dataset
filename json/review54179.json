Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If I were an enemy of George Lucas and was able to buy Star Wars only to destroy the franchise\\, this is exactly the movie I'd ask Rian Johnson to make. It's so utterly terrible that it has to have been on purpose. \\n\\nThe number of idiotic choices this movie made is a giant slap in the face of any Star Wars fan. Did you like Luke Skywalkers sense of hope and optimism? Did you want to know why Rey is so strong in the Force and perfect? Or who her parents are? Did you want to know more about Snoke? Did you want to see the Knights of Ren? Did you want to make sure real world politics and social issues stayed out of a fictional universe? Well that's too bad\\, none of those things happen.\\n\\nIt's a two hour long space chase that ultimately ends in Luke betraying himself\\, the actual dead actor living on while the living actor dies. Finn gets his character arc destroyed by the most awkward kiss in cinematic history\\, the big bad omniscient guy dies from someone using the force right next to him\\, they weaponized hyper speed..making us wonder why there was even a plan to kill the first two Death Stars besides sending a droid through it.\\n\\nIt's sloppy\\, poorly written\\, fraught with leftist propaganda\\, the characters don't act according to their character\\, the plot is boring\\, an entire scene takes place on a casino planet instead of training Rey...the list goes on. This is a dumpster fire\\, but at least it's a pretty one\\, right?\\n\\nGo destroy your own legacies with your \\\"subverting expectations\\,\\\" Rian.","true":true}
