Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely wreaked of feminism. Producer Kathleen Kennedy destroyed this movie in the name of political correctness. \\n\\nOh gee where do I start? How about for every male fighter pilot had to have a capable female counterpart pilot\\, almost all the officers\\, and generals were female. Almost all the leadership positions were made by females on the alliance side. The operators\\, captains\\, and even Rose the maintenance person. Fin gets put in his place and corrected by Rose and told she saved him instead of the other way around. Poe the Han Solo\\, Mad Max male role model protagonist tries to hold the male plot of saving the alliance\\, but is put in his place by Leah and her female general who knock him out and throw him in the brig. Because after all he's a hothead who can't think logically and rationally apparently a male trait (eyes roll). And let's not forget the most ridiculous part\\, Fin hardly takes down the most bad a$$ storm trooper who is combat worthy\\, military\\, trained battled hardened in shiny silver armor\\, but wait... is he a strong male with brute strength? Nope! He's a she. A female leading the storm troopers and apparently handing Fin's a$$ to him in battle because she has so much testosterone and physical strength apparently surpassing all the other elite storm troopers. Absolutely absurd. It was hard to even enjoy the movie when there was such an absorbent amount of energy put into culture appropriation and PC crap. I felt like I was watching the all female cast ghostbusters part 2\\, crossed with Laura Croft and GI Jane.\\n\\nOh yes... I almost forgot Kathleen got to make sure the general of the alliance had her purple hair to appease the LGBT crowd. Of course! Thanks for turning this movie into one large anti-male\\, feminist\\, equality\\, PC\\, PR movement. You just lit up and pissed off 2\/3 of your fanbase (yes males) on fire.","true":true}
