Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A truly terrible film\\, which will resonate through the Star Wars universe. There are too many plot holes\\, Disney-mandated plush toy Christmas gifts\/characters\\, terrible dialogue\\, and meandering storylines that make no sense\\, to comment upon here.\\n\\nWhen I see a Star Wars film\\, I expect three\\, simple things: 1. This is going to be a rollicking adventure across space; 2. It won't pander. It is an action film. Han always shot first; 3. The storyline will make sense\\, is punctuated by witty\\, cutting dialogue\\, and gives the audience a clear understanding of where we're going\\, and why.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi has none of these. .5 stars.","true":true}
