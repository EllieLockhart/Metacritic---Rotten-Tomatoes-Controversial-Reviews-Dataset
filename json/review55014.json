Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was terrible.  Absolutely terrible.  From the plot to the dialogue to the overuse of CGI to even bad dubbing I found this movie terrible from beginning to end.\\n\\nThe whole movie was literally just a bunch of setups where characters were put into peril time and time again and then were saved at the last second by one Deus Ex Machina after another.  There was even one entire storyline that simply took up about 45 minutes and in the end was pointless.\\n\\nI saw the original Star Wars when I was 6 years old and have been a fan for 40 years\\, but I'm done with the Star Wars universe.  IV through VI is part of my youth so they will hold a place in my heart for the rest of my life.  I thought that I - III were mostly not that good\\, but they did have some great moments and I give George Lucas credit for trying to build a compelling vision of his universe before Episode IV while staying true to what was already done.\\n\\nWhat I hate about the new ones is that they are not Star Wars movies.  They are just big budget CGI-fests with generic cliches but using SW characters.  \\n\\nThis movie was not Star Wars.","true":true}
