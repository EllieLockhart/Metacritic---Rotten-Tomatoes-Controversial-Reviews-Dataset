Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Far too long. Some corny scenes that were not need. The middle of the movie definitely needed some editing. Great action scenes and cgi as always with a Star Wars film. ","true":true}
