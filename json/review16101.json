Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a super fan... just shy of cosplay. Loved it! Great movie to bring in tge generations\\, and to prooel the not-so-simple-as-light-and-dark story and themes. my biggest gauge for its success is that the whole family of 5 went\\, and everyone - from 5 to 42 - loved (or at least liked) it. There will be some things that the uber-fan won't love\\, and it's not a perfect movie (there were a couple cringeworthy moments)\\, but it's what I think a Star Wars movie in the 21st century should be.","true":true}
