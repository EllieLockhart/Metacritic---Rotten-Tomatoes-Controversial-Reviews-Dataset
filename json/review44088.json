Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ subverts all of your expectations from TFA in some amazing and sometimes horrifying ways\\, as a star wars fan the choices the director makes with the story seem to tear apart all we thought we knew about the Star Wars universe. Most people I have spoken with about this movie hate how Luke is portrayed and the sidequest Finn and Rose go on\\, I understand the sidequest hate because it honestly does not add much to the story at all\\, just so that two of our heroes can be on Snokes ship when Holdo destroys it\\, and for the Benicio Del Toro twist\\, take that part of this movie out and I would have enjoyed everything\\, or at least make it necessary to the plot. The Luke storyline and attitude of our titular character hate makes me question if people watched this movie or Force Awakens\\, Luke was our good natured powerful hero at the end of Return\\, but in the time since then\\, as portrayed in this movie and TFA he has tried and failed to restart the jedi\\, caused one of his pupils to tun on him by thinking of and trying to kill him\\, he lost everything he had tried to build because of his fear of the dark side growing inside of Ben Solo and his rush to the conclusion that he must kill Ben was the downfall of Luke and the Jedi\\, he left for the Island because he had given up and wanted the Jedi order to end\\, he saw the failures of himself and the Jedi before the empire as a failed system and wanted those failures to never be repeated again\\, he is a broken man when we see him on the new trilogy\\, all the events and tragedies in his life since Return have changed him into the man we see\\, he is reinvigorated by Rey's faith and Yoda showing him a new path\\, The Jedi's old ways were there downfall\\, Luke needed to change the Jedi instead of giving into the Fear of the darkside that lead to their destruction at the hands of the sith\\, but he let himself fall victim to that fear for the briefest of moments and that made him lose EVERYTHING. Now that my Luke rant is over I want to appreciate the stunning visuals and the bold additions to known force abilities the director added to the Star Wars universe\\, just because we have not seen something in the previous 8 Star Wars movies does not mean it cannot be done\\, I loved all the new and interesting things used in the movie\\, especially when Luke uses an astral form to confront Kylo\\, that scene blew my mind\\, and after that we see that the effort took a huge toll on Luke\\, possibly meaning the reason this ability had not been used before is because of the power\\, concentration and pure skill needed to perform such an act. This movie has some wonderful and brilliant moments\\, Kylo killing Snoke was a huge surprise\\, and even tho we saw snoke die does not mean he is dead forever\\, he could be a reincarnated Darth Plagues\\, he could be a new Force user similar to him\\, in Star Wars the clone wars\\, DARTH MAUL SURVIVED BEING CUT IN HALF\\, it is possible snoke\\, who is clearly a more powerful force user could do the same\\, Holdo's hyperspace jump was incredible\\, that shot had me gaping in my seat in the theater\\, thinking\\, WOOOOOW THAT WAS INCREDIBLE\\, all the leaps and chances taken in this film blew my mind\\, I thouroughly enjoyed the fresh take and expansion of the star wasr universe and would rank this movie behind empire in my favorite and best ranking\\, this movie makes me wonder where JJ will take episode 9. OH and on the Rey's parents being nobodies storyline\\, I have a theory that so far I have not seen anywhere yet\\, Snoke told us that he was controlling what Kylo could see\\, he controlled Kylo's visions and he was controlling the link Rey and Kylo had throughout the film\\, what if\\, bear with me\\, what if SNOKE CREATED THAT STORY AS A LIE TO MAKE REY VULNERABLE\\, he could have sown that into Kylo's mind knowing he would tell Rey\\, and when she went into the Dark pit on the island\\, the darkness showed her herself when she begged to see her parents\\, why would it not show her\\, she is not a skywalker or a kenobi or any other wild theory\\, what of she is an incarnation of the force\\, she was able to use the force rather quickly with no training or prior experience knowing what the force was in TFA\\, she could be like anakin and be a child if the force\\, or it was all deceit and her parents really are force users\\, we don't know\\, I am willing to believe she is a nobody because that plays into the force being everywhere and I would love for that to be the case\\, but for all those that seemingly need her to be a skywalker or something she still can be\\, are you willing to believe a vision shown to Kylo by a person like Snoke... like\\, that's a little far fetched\\, would you believe the Emperor if he said your parents were drunks and left you on some random planets doorstep... bad comparison but whatever\\, this movie took bold steps and most of them were right in step with the universe this new trilogy is building on\\, do not compare this new trilogy and movie to past ones and how great they were\\, this movie is building on that universe and enhancing it\\, not breaking it down and tossing it out\\, I do not want to see the saem Star Wars cliches and stories over and over again\\, I want new and bold and interesting\\, this movie gave me that and I love it for it. I hope you enjoyed reading my very\\, very\\, VEEERY long review by and long time Star Wars fan\\, thank for reading\\, BYE.","true":true}
