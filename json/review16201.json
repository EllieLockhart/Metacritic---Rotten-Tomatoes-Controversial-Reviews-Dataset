Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm honestly shocked at most of the user reviews to this movie. It was one of the best Star Wars movies I've ever seen and I will be going back to see it again at some point. I think the majority of the bad reviews are coming from OG fans that watched the trilogy when it was first released\\, and while I understand the pain that you must be feeling\\, all good things must come to an end and be given over to the new era of Star Wars. Nothing lasts forever. Not even Luke Skywalker.","true":true}
