Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This does not feel like the original trilogy\\, but let's face it: the possibility for that magic to be instilled in new films is slim.  The movie is long\\, with so many subplots it'll make you dizzy.  However\\, the movie is amusing.  Though it doesn't feel like the Star Wars we grew up with\\, the film in itself is entertaining. I wish there wasn't so much going on. We wanted this movie for Luke. Instead we have new characters introduced that we care nothing for\\, many plots that seem like fluff\\, and a main plot that doesn't progress until the last 30 minutes. An entertaining movie. Much more comedy than you'll be used to based on the original trilogy\\, but thankfully nowhere near as bad as the prequel trilogy.","true":true}
