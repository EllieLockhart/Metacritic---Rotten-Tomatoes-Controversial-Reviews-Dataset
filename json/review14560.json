Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a fan for 34 years. I love star wars. I don't understand the hate for this film. It was absolutely fantastic. The story was tight and thrilling. The characters had humor and there was a lot of tension throughout the movie. ALL\\, of the battles were so well done and intense. It made me feel as if i were watching a continuation of the original trilogy. Way better than force awakens for sure. Sucks that so many hated it\\, i thought it was great and i will see it again.","true":true}
