Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful interpretation of the universe with pointless plots\\, unreal characters\\, and a message that was meant to tell the viewer that everything you love about Star Wars means nothing. Absolute trash as a story.","true":true}
