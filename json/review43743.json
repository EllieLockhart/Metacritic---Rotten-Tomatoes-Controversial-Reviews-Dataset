Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the new Star Wars movie I hoped for: A movie that introduced many original ideas while delivering the action\\, tone and characters we know.\\n\\nIs it perfect? No way. No movie is\\, although Episode V of Star Wars comes close. I felt this movie was a bit too long\\, some sub-plots could have been taken out or cut shorter.\\n\\nBut the main plot about Kylo\\, Luke and Rey is really great. It really gets you invested in the movie and the turns it took never stopped to surprise me. I loved it when they killed Snoke - this was a wonderful moment that invalidated all those stupid fan theories. Snoke was just a plot device and not the Emperor 2.0 - great. This story isn\u00b4t about him\\, its about Kylo\\, he is our villain.\\n\\nThe humor in the movie was more pronounced compared with other Star Wars movie\\, but I prefer that over an almost humorless movie like Rogue One. I did not mind it.","true":true}
