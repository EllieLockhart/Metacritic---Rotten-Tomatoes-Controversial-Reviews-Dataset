Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everything I wanted to see in a Star Wars movie as well as some great unexpected twists! I think the CGI on Leia floating in space was fake enough that it took me out of the movie\\, but just for that moment. I think Rian Johnson did a better job writing than JJ Abrams.","true":true}
