Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I\u2019m gonna start off by saying that I don\u2019t like this type of gameplay\\, but I enjoyed the last of us one because of the story and characters\\, I wish I could say the same thing about the last of us 2\\, I literally felt empty throughout most of the game the only good parts were the intro and Ellie\u2019s flashbacks. I get that they\u2019re trying to explain that revenge and vengeance are bad and they Will never have a good outcome but this isn\u2019t how you explain it. Take for example the god of war series\\, they explained it perfectly. Cratos basically killed all of his enemies but the lesson learnt was that killing them could never bring him peace nor bring back his family. However in this game Ellie literally loses everyone she loves and never gets revenge.Also do you really expect us to forgive or sympathize with Abby simply because you gave us her backstory at the worst time possible?  I never expected NaughtyDog to make a story this bad and if someone told me this story before the game came out I would think they Were reading fan fiction\\, save your money.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
