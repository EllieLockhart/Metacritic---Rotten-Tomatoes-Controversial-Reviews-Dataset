Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a lot of fun. From the perspective of someone who likes but doesn't love Star Wars\\, this is about as good as these movies get. The pacing was unconventional but that worked in its favor- after a franchise full of typical \\\"build up to life-or-death finale where the good guys win through sheer dumb luck\\,\\\" it was refreshing to have failed attempts\\, non-starter plants and mistakes with consequences for both the good and bad guys.","true":true}
