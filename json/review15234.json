Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked the movie\\, overall. I think they needed to do more with Poe and I felt Finn was handled poorly - Is he a coward or not? But Luke\\, Leia\\, Kylo and Rey were all written in ways that made sense for their characters\\, I felt. I really hate that the \\\"hardcore\\\" fans are crapping on this movie. I wish they could have seen it without expectations\\, like I did. Anyway\\, go see it and make up your own mind.","true":true}
