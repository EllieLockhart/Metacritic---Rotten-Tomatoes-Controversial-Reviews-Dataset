Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Remembering that I am an avid Stars Wars fan since 1976\\, I tried hard to like this movie.  However\\, despite the awesome cinematography and special effects\\, it ended up being just another thrown-together mish-mash from all of the previous episodes.  Almost no original thinking whatsoever. I am deeply disappointed in Disney's lack of creativity these days.","true":true}
