{"101487":167484,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Snoke and Mirrors: The Jedi That Got Away\\n\\nBe Forewarned:  Total Spoiler Review-Do Not Read If You Don't Want to Know \\n\\nUpon viewing \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" I come away feeling as if it was a romantic relationship that started out exciting\\, compelling\\, interesting\\, hot and then\\, just when you thought it was really gonna go somewhere slowly falls apart\\, even though you hang in there\\, trying your hardest to hold on to that something special you thought you saw seemingly only moments ago\\, only in the end sadly walking away and left to wonder whether there was anything there to begin with. \\n\\nThe film opens with a wonderfully fun\\, dramatic battle scene dominated by the hot shot antics of Resistance Pilot Poe Dameron who almost single handedly wins a seemingly \\\"all is lost\\\" space battle against the New Order.  It's echoes of WWII bombing raids baked into the heart of the scene makes one fondly recall how George Lucas referenced films depicting aerial dogfights to choreograph fighter battles in the original Star Wars: A New Hope.  The sequence also displays the sacrifices that victory in battle may extol and also set up an emotional through line in the film.   \\n\\nThis opening scene was so well thought out and filmed\\, with an apparent appreciation for the film making of the original series that I was primed to settle in for what should have been a rollicking ride tempered with a battle for the soul of The Force.  Instead we were treated to a slog-worse\\, a nonsensical slog built around a battle of attrition devoid of all logic to the point that it is insulting.  I'm not sure if Writer\/Director Rian Johnson is given too much credit for being a genius that he arrogantly thinks he can do whatever he likes and persons from film executives to the average audience member will stand and applaud him for it\\, or if he just doesn't care\\, but the centerpiece of the film\\, (both this slog of attrition and its related seemingly supposed to be brilliant aka \\\"bet you didn't see that coming\\\" solution proposed for what seems to be an all-is-lost situation for the Resistance) is so laughingly absurd in its  premise that I could only come away feeling slightly angry that this is the best they could come up with\\, and moreover\\, that anyone is supposed to buy this garbage\\, lock-stock and barrel.   \\n\\nFor those who (for some reason) are reading this before seeing The Last Jedi allow me to set up the scenario and I think you will easily see how and why it is silly to the point of foolishness:  A small band of Resistance ships (the largest being a Cruiser) that constitutes all that is left of the Resistance is being chased by a massive armada of Star Destroyer and Super Star Destroyer class ships that surprises them by being able to track them through light speed (Note:  This is a big deal both within Star Wars Canon and the film itself but how it is done is never explained-Get ready for a steady dose of this kind of laziness).  The Resistance ships are now left with seemingly nowhere to run except straight ahead\\, away from the armada (their Cruiser seemingly faster and more agile then the hulking New Order ships) unless and until they can find a way to save their skins\\, they have only as much time as the fuel in their ships\\, they run out of fuel\\, the fall back and get torn apart by the big guns of the New Order.  The absurdity of this scenario should be apparent to anyone who has working gray matter and would be obvious even to the most inept naval commander-Those giant New Order ships still have light speed at their disposal-simply calculate short jumps for a few of your giant ships to cut off and surround the Resistance Cruiser and blammo-game over\\, film over\\, franchise over.  How or why this obvious strategic move is not dealt with is Laziness Exhibit \\\"A\\\".  Fast forward to the Resistance's grand plan\/surprise move to outwit the New Order and save themselves and we go from the merely silly to the grossly absurd.  The big move is to get close enough to a planet that housed an old Rebel base\\, abandon ship in Transports that somehow will now be invisible to the New Order's ships (again\\, not explained how this is supposed to actually function) allowing them to float down to this planet undetected\\, then the New Order will destroy the Cruiser when it runs out of fuel\\, thinking it has killed the last of the Resistance.  For this to be plausible we must accept what we are told by the Writer\/Director which is:  \\\"All that technology\\, scanners\\, etc. on the New Order ships\\, let alone plain visuals (Does anyone have a telescope or a zoom function on the New Order ships?)-Yeah\\, forget about that\\, it doesn't work.  Why?  Because I said so.\\\"  The arrogance imbued with this laziness again pushes me to the point of sad\\, sad disappointment and frustration\\, if not a touch of anger.  \\n\\nAfter seeing the film and searching online for others disaffected by The Last Jedi and one of the headlines of an article that I did not waste my time on or allow to further insult my intelligence touted this film as being great because Rian Johnson didn't care what the audience thought.  First\\, I didn't know that arrogance instantly begat greatness (don't get me started on our current political situation) and second\\, isn't this the exact same complaint that an entire move going populace made against George Lucas for his work on the franchise's prequel's?  So George's arrogance is bad\\, Rian's is good-Because you say so....Got it.  Don't get me wrong\\, here and there\\, singleness of mind and purpose can be an asset in certain situations but I would say the proof is in the pudding both in the prequels and The Last Jedi as to the potential cost of arrogance within a hallowed artistic universe that has become part of the social fabric of our time.  Much has been given by the people of this world to this franchise\\, this universe\\, it's beliefs\\, it's values\\, it's principles-all we ask is that you care half as much as we do and respect what we found special about it.  J.J. Abrams understood that\\, seemingly\\, Rian Johnson didn't.  It was the proposed arrogance of George Lucas that we begged him to step out of the way\\, to let others with the perspective that distance can bring to something so beloved\\, step in and lead our galaxy far\\, far away to new and better places while keeping sacred that which we hold dear about our beloved time a long time ago.  Lucas gave in and let go of his baby\\, only now to have it swept up in talons of someone who didn't have the cohesion of vision that he did\\, and doesn't care to even give a story in one film that make sense\\, let alone\\, one we can believe in.\\n\\nGetting back to the grating folly that is the \\\"slow chase scene\\\" that forms the spine of the film-What adds to my despondency of this storytelling device is the amount of time\\, talent and resources devoted to it\\, especially when we are shortchanged in so many meaningful areas\\, that again\\, appear to be too difficult for the Writer\/Director to deal with in a meaningful fashion so he just punts on them and\/or rams things down our throats.  Wouldn't you have liked to have seen more time put into the why's and wherefores of Luke's exile?  We are forced to believe that Luke Skywalker\\, incredibly brave\\, always looking for adventure\\, courage enough to stare down the Emperor\\, and mature enough to ultimately turn away from the dark side\\, now is a mope.  Not only a mope\\, but a mope who in the face of a mistake runs to the cradle of the Jedi\\, to what?  Learn where he went wrong?  Why didn't I come here first and took the time to do my homework and then teach?  What can I learn to now fix this?  Help me Master Yoda?  No-simply to mope\\, learn about the Jedi\\, decide they are shit and then after making such a decision\\, then decide I'm going to live out the rest of my days freeloading off the Jedi caretakers\\, wallowing in the spawn of the Jedi.  Why? Who knows.  \\n\\nDoes this sound anything like the Luke Skywalker we have come to know so well? Does it sound anything like any Skywalker we have ever hear of?  Leia?  Anakin?  Padme?  Ah\\, you will say\\, that is the point-Luke needs to be broken to have his triumphant return.  Fine\\, break him\\, but make it a believable break.  That he was so overwrought that he came to Ach-To to learn where he went wrong\\, that he found where he went wrong\\, but lacks the confidence (a clear Skywalker trait in the male line) to do what he feels he can to make things right\\, to heal Ben\\, or at least try.  Instead we are left with an arrogant mope. This mischaracterization of Luke is underscored by Yoda's visit where he invokes that Luke's head is \\\"still in the stars\\\" and not where he is\\, what is right in front of him.  Really?  This self obsessed mope?  Is this who Yoda is referring to.  What a joke\\, a sad\\, sad joke.  \\nI presumed in this passing of the baton trilogy that they would have to kill off Luke.  I hoped and suspected that they would do so in a way that showed Luke sacrificing himself so that others may live.  They got that right\\, and I liked the Force Projection part of the story\\, but the twin suns closing of the Luke loop (as it were) while nice\\, seemed forced.  Give me the one\\, actual sun\\, with Luke mirroring his iconic look\\, that would have been enough.  Instead\\, the audience is treated like idiots and a second sun that isn't there is pablumed into the shot\\, distracting from Luke's farewell.\\n  \\nAdd into all of the foregoing the following huge missteps and acts of laziness and my dislike of this film grows to levels of sadness:\\n\\n--Rey's Origins?  That huge\\, central part of our new \\\"Light Side\\\" character?  That element of family that is central to the DNA of the franchise?  Yeah\\, well\\, just forget about that.  Granted it may be a red herring in this film with a later payoff\\, but between the info from Kylo to Rey's pointless \\\"dark cave\\\" sequence it is a \\\"meh\\\" in The Last Jedi.\\n\\n--Who is Snoke?  You know\\, the powerful dark force mentor of the newest baddie in the universe?  One so powerful as to steal him away from Luke\\, turn Ben totally dark and take over the universe?  Yeah\\, forget about him too.  And by the way\\, he's also an fool.  \\n\\n--Jedi Training:  Luke got little; Rey essentially gets none; but hey they are all powerful.  Who needs Yoda?  Who needs training?  All those Jedi in the prequels who worked their butts off-fools.  Everyone knows either you have it or you don't.  Hard work\\, caring about what you do and mastering your craft is apparently for losers.\\n\\n--Machines are Better than People:  I love BB8 but why if continues to save the day then just put a red cape on him and give him his own franchise\\, I mean\\, who needs people let alone Jedi when you have Super BB8!  \\n\\nOK\\, I may be nitpicking now but I think you see where I am going and where I am coming from.  The seeming\\, repeating\\, lazy answer in this film to when people are in trouble is: BB8\\, time and time again.  And don't get me started on Super Leia who has no Force training and yet is impervious to explosions and the vacuum of space.  Thanks for rendering an entire universe and seven prior films meaningless.  Does this mean Han Solo faked his death and has a triumphant return in the next film?  At this point why not.\\n\\nThere was so much promise here\\, so much to work with and instead we were given a string of pointless\\, nonsensical set pieces that end nowhere.  Don't get me wrong\\, there were some great moments-the opening battle\\, the Kylo\/Rey scenes\\, Benicio Del Toro's captivating performance\\, but they do not\\, and cannot overcome a film that has a pretty face but is rotten at  its core.","true":true}
