Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While visually stunning\\, nearly the entire film leaves you questioning what you just watched. From the First Orders never ending incompetence to plot lines that make you grown ugh. Possibly Worth a 3.99 rental on a lazy Saturday if you literally have nothing better to do.","true":true}
