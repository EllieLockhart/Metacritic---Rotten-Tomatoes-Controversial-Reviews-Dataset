Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lot of side missions with no main mission \/ plot. Characters did not change or grow in any way. There were some good action sequences and a few funny scenes. Overall\\, too long and not that great.","true":true}
