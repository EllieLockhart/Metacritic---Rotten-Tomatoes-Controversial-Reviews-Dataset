Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just do not get all the bad reviews. I loved it and have seen it twice. I am an old Star Wars fan from the beginning to the tune of seeing the first movie in the series 10 times at the theater. It was a very good movie. I enjoyed it more the second time . Go to the movie enjoy the ride and see where the struggle of the force carries us.","true":true}
