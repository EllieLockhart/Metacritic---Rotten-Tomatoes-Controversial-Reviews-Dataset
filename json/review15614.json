Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved the movie! It is thoughtful\\, character driven\\, and expanded the universe in a couple cool ways. It leaves many questions for episode 9. It has great twists\\, and set up for some more twist in the next movie. More importantly it starting to answer the question of what does anikin's bringing balance to the force mean. After episode 6 how could the force driven jedi vs. sith thread make sense if Anikin did bring balance to the force? Kylo Ren's character gets infinity more interesting to me\\, and unlike most I liked Luke in this film and his character arc as well (it follows what Mark Hamill was asked to play\\, \\\"An obi-wan\\\" mentor role\\, as was stated in multiple interviews).  Sadly Rey felt slightly flat to me\\, and some the creatures were disconnected from previous art directions of starwars\\, but I am open to new worlds and creatures and seeing the galaxy and its strangest corners. It is something that I always have loved about star wars. Being a fan since childhood and this movie taking me somewhere new (not following the EU) is exciting\\, and I can't wait to see episode 9!","true":true}
