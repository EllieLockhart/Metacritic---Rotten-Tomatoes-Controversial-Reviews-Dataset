Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Seems stale from the get-go\\, although it has some moments. In general\\, it tries to do too much\\, becomes preposterous even within its own framework\\, and sacrifices emotional impact for action.  And most of the emotional impact it does strive for comes off flat. It all seems like a set up for a new generation of sequels.","true":true}
