Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Better than \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" in every conceivable way....but still just an OK movie. I've finally accepted that Star Wars movies really aren't that great....the only truly GREAT SW movie was \\\"The Empire Strikes Back.\\\"","true":true}
