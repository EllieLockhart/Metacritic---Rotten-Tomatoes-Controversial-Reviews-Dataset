Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wasted characters\\, wasted plot\\, wasted two and a half hours\\, wasted ten dollars. If the film was trying to emulate The Phantom Menace it did a great job\\, minus good light saber fights.","true":true}
