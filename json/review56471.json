Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The filmography was beautiful\\, but between the story and editing I wasn't able to connect with the movie. \\n\\nI felt like I had whiplash watching the movie jump quickly back and forth between plots.  Cuts and scenes felt rushed\\, and there weren't a lot of time spent on those 'scene setting' shots you usually expect with Star Wars.\\n\\nBut the biggest issue was the character development. Luke Skywalker was not in any way a character you could point back to developing from the original series (especially the person he evolved into by the end of them).  And our new heroes did not seem to evolve at all from the lessons they should have learned during the course of the film.  \\n\\nCharacters became almost comical in an attempt to create a connection with the audience. In addition to the character development issues\\, there were too many unnecessary creatures used as plot devices that felt so out of place that it was like watching a marketing team write the plot.\\n\\nI wanted to like it\\, but overall it felt like a lacking place holder for a story that should have been shown and not told.\\n\\nMad props to the actors\\, tech teams\\, and CG team though.","true":true}
