Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"tHIS MOVIE IS DISSAPOINTING FOR STAR WARS FANS AS WELL AS THE AVERAGE MOVIE GOER LOOKING FOR A GOOD SCI-FI ACTION MOVIE.  iT FAILS TO DELIVER ON SO MANY ELEMENTS THAT tHE fORCE aWAKENS INTRODUCED TO US.  THE PORTRAYAL OF LUKE SKYWALKER IS ABYSMAL.  IN FACT NONE OF THE CHARACTERS HAVE DEVELOPMENT.   tOO MUCH IS COPYING ELEMENTS FROM THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.  fOR NON STAR WARS FANS\\,  THE PLOT IS BORING AS OVER HALF THE MOVIE IS A SLOW CHASE THROUGH SPACE.  sO MUCH IS LEFT UNANSWERED THAT IT'S HARD TO CARE FOR ANY OF THE CHARACTERS.  tHE STORY IS A MESS.  tOO MANY ELEMENTS JUST THROWN IN\\, LIKE THE CANTO BIGHT SCENE WHICH IS BOTH DEGRADING CAPITALISM WHILE PUSHING ANIMAL RIGHTS.  nOTHING WRONG WITH ANIMAL RIGHTS\\, BUT IS THAT THE THEME WE ARE LOOKING FOR IN THE SEQUEL TO STAR WARS?  cHECK OUT IVAN ORTEGA'S WORK EDITING THE FILM FOR STAR WARS FANS ON YOUTUBE TO SEE WHY SO MANY ARE DISAPOINTED IN THIS LATEST INSTALLMENT OF THE STAR WARS FRANCHISE.","true":true}
