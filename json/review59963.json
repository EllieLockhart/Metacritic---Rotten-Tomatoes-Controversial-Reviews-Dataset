The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"tl;dr: it's a cult classic. Just like the first game.\r\rNow to elaborate\\, first let's talk about TLOU1:\r\r- You start the game as Joel's daughter. Then she dies. In the intro. Brutal. To the hands of a main human antagonist (authority). Sets the tone for the rest of the game. Revenge. Anger. Violence.\r- She gets replaced by another character. Ellie.\r- You get hurt really bad mid-game. You get to play as Ellie. Just to be in her shoes\\, and realize how badass she is\\, and how much you\/Joel care about her.\r- If you're a fan like me\\, you got to play a second time as her in the DLC. Explaning further what she did when joel was hurt. And she did that to save him. You also learn that she is a lesbian. Her first love dies.\r- Some other loveable characters like Bill and that woman from the beginning die during the game. Including the Head of the fireflies.\r- Joel kills hundreds of people not to save mankind\\, but to keep Ellie alive for him. That's beautiful\\, and this is why people (like me) love that game. But also\\, from a humanity perspective\\, he did that for nothing.\r- You stealth kill with a bow and arrow\\, fight clickers\\, or just walk beautiful nieghborhoods\\, and cuddle giraffes.\r\r=> GOTY. best game ever. People like it. Nothing to say storywise\\, or technically speaking (music\\, graphics\\, gameplay mechanics\\, fun\\, narration\\, escape factor\\, etc.\r\rThere was four-chan in 2013. But no alt-right vs. feminism civil war yet.\r\rNow TLOU2:\r\r- You start the game as Ellie. Then Joel dies. Early. Brutal. To the hands of a main human antagonist (Abby). His lies just caught up to him\\, tbh. Sets the tone for the rest of the game. Revenge. Anger. Violence. (You were deceived\\, judging by the trailers\\, that maybe Ellie's new girlfriend died early. Oh\\, and you knew she was a lesbian\\, remember?)\r- He gets replaced by another character.\r- You get to play as that another character at some point. Just to be in her shoes\\, and realize how badass she is\\, and how much you understand her.\r- If you're a fan\\, you probably get to play as other characters in upcoming DLC. Explaning things further too.\r- Some other loveable characters die during the game.\r- Ellie kills hundreds of people not to get Kratos revenge\\, but to realize that Joel is alive in her thoughts\\, and that killing some more won't bring him back. That's beautiful\\, and this is why people (like me) love that game. But also\\, from another perspective\\, she did that for nothing. As she doesn't kill Abby\\, and ends up dramatically hurt.\r- You stealth kill with a bow and arrow\\, fight clickers\\, or just walk beautiful nieghborhoods and sceneries.\r- And a few more surprises\r\r=> GOTY. best game ever for the press and the professionals\\, the ones deemd controversial and the others. But some people hate it. Nothing to say technically speaking (music\\, graphics\\, gameplay mechanics\\, fun\\, narration\\, escape factor\\, etc.)\\, so they spit on it storywise.\r\rFour-chan is overtaken by alt-right vs. feminists drama\\, and a Y Generation that find everything \\\"cringy\\\" and violently hate anything within minutes\\, as if it was the end of their world.\r\rWelcome to 2020.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
