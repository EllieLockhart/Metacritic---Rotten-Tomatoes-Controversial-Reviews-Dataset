Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The problems with this are too wide and many to go into. It's like no one bothered to watch any previous star wars and no one was in charge of writing or directing.\\nNo reason to watch the next film as this kills everything and anything remotely interesting created by its previous installment. Glad the star wars franchise ended with return of the jedi.","true":true}
