Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very well done Star Wars film\\, but definitely not what I expected. How it\u2019s vastly different from Force Awakens (and most Star Wars films) was that this film largely isolated many of the main characters from each other for the majority of the film\\, so it did feel somewhat scattered throughout the galaxy instead of the usual ensemble parading around in the Millennium Falcon. Otherwise\\, The Last Jedi had great visuals\\, exciting battles\\, interesting plot twists\\, and is a great continuation to the Star Wars saga that largely does its aging characters justice while continuing to build the new ones in interesting ways. My new Star Wars rankings are as follows: (from worst to best) Attack of the Clones\\, Phantom Menace\\, Revenge of the Sith\\, Return of the Jedi\\, Rogue One\\, The Last Jedi\\, Force Awakens\\, A New Hope\\, and Empire Strikes Back.","true":true}
