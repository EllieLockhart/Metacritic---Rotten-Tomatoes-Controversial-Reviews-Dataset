Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A great scifi movie with visuals? Yes.. Is it Star Wars? No. It has ruined the magic we have been waiting to see for years. Multiple plot holes and meaningless endings\\, one of my least favorite Star Wars. I walked out of the theater asking myself\\, \\\"Did I actually like that movie?\\\"","true":true}
