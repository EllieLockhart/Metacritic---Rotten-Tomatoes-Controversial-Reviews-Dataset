The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"So to be quite frank\\, I don\u2019t understand what everyone\u2019s deal with this game is. While yes\\, the developers killed off Joel\\, you need to understand not only why the developers made that choice\\, but why Abby as a character was so motivated to do so.While we can sympathize with him and try to minimize his actions\\, what Joel did to the Fireflies was an objectively horrible act that prevented the world from being saved for his own selfish desire to have a daughter figure back. Even Joel knows this\\, considering he lied to Ellie for so long about it. While I didn\u2019t want Joel to die\\, that\u2019s why I personally felt motivated to engage in Ellie\u2019s borderline suicidal pursuit for revenge. It was not the period of events we wanted\\, but it was one vital to the progression of Ellie\u2019s character.I\u2019ve heard complaints of how characters act \u201cout of character\u201d in this game\\, which is not true at all. The world of TLOU is not a world for pure protagonists. Taking Ellie as the main character being targeted by this critique\\, she is an incredibly traumatized young woman living in a world of constant fear and danger. It\u2019s entirely unrealistic to expect her to be anything less than majorly flawed.In Abby\u2019s story\\, I found the humanization of those I had previously hated to be a very unique and cognitively challenging hurdle to get over. I killed these people earlier as Ellie\\, and now they appear as more than targets. They\u2019re allies and friends. Abby\u2019s story pulls more from the original game than Ellie\u2019s story does. It\u2019s a bunch of new characters rediscovering a feeling of purity and innocence only for that to be squashed by the events of the world around them. It\u2019s an incredibly sad and effective tale that causes even more distress when I have to pin the two against each other.For people criticizing the writing of the dialogue\\, all I\u2019m going to ask is what did you get out of the first game that the dialogue of this one was so \u2018bad\u2019?I saw one comment about the game getting \u2018political\u2019. What? What\u2019s political about the game? The fact that Ellie\u2019s gay? How\u2019s someone\u2019s sexual preference a political take?The only reason I don\u2019t give the game a 10 is because of the way the epilogue was rolled out. While I really liked the epilogue as a whole\\, it felt like the game was going to end like 15 times before the rattler sequence. Also the concept of super evil guys that just like torturing people for fun I a post-apocalyptic zombie-like apocalypse is a dumb trope\\, but neither of these are major issues by any stretch of the imagination.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
