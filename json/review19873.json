Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was better than The Force Awakens\\, production design wise. But I thought The Force Awakens was very dirivitive. This one was also like watching Empire and Return of the Jedi in one. Luke Skywalker's fate was just anti-climatic and useless. Admiral Gender Studies was a confusing and useless character. Rose was a terribly forced character. Both took the audience away from knowing Finn and the other guy more. See\\, already forgot one of their names. Bombs don't drop in space - no gravity.","true":true}
