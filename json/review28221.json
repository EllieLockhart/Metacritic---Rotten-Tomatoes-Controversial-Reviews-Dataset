Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poorly written & edited\\,plus a very dull undertone which the story line is dumbed down to promote politics instead of developing characters & continuing plot points set up in The Force Awakens.This is one big headache of a film.","true":true}
