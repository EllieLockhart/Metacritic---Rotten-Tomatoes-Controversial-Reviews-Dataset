Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Strong\\, exciting\\, emotional\\, unexspected and funny. It's too long\\, the whole casino scene should have been cut out\\, all of the scene on the salt planet are very boring until the scene with ... and ... (I don't want to spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it). There much other problems in this movie\\, which I can't tell here because it contains spoilers. All in all\\, it's a good movie and you should go and see it as soon as possible!","true":true}
