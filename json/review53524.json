Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Entertaining\\, but completely butchered the character of Luke Skywalker...Mark Hamil was so badly used and I feel insanely sorry for him. This was his moment and Rian Johnson screwed it up. Horrible misstep and I hope JJ Abrams makes Rian Johnsons film an afterthought.","true":true}
