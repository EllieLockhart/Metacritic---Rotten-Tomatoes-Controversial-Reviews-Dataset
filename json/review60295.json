Every animation is oozing with character and emotion. The sound design is impeccable and you'll find lots of little sounds you never expected to hear but glad you did. Combat is visceral and responsive and the enemy AI is diverse. I look at the quality in disbelief of what they've accomplished and every moment has been a pleasure. When you witness each animation for the first time\\, you can pick up on little details\\, like how drawers are lifted slightly as they're pulled out.\r\rThe thing most people dislike is the story. They say it falls flat or is too divergent\\, but I think it takes a bold step into discussing\\, exploring and representing parts of the human experience that most games\/movies\/shows miss out on. You explore an entirely destructive experience in which you lose far more than you could imagine as multiple powerful revenge narratives take their course.\r\rThe series is founded on tragedy and trauma\\, so don't expect to find happy endings and silver linings here. While the unconventional act structure leaves a major plot thread hanging for multiple hours\\, time bounces back and forth seemingly at whim and fleeting characters pass in and out of the story at regular intervals\\, you come to understand that nothing is as simple as you would to believe it is\\, and justice cannot be true justice without context and empathy.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
