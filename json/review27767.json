Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"People who hate this movie only dislike it because they took many risks. They didn\u2019t discard what the Force Awakens began\\, they paid off many of the setups while setting up Ep. 9 to be (like 8) something we\u2019ve never seen before in a Star Wars film. As a side note Mark Hamil is spectacular in this film!!","true":true}
