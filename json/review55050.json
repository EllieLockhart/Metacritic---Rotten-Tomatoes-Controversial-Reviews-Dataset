Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've long loved the Star Wars franchise\\, even the less popular episodes like The Phantom Menace. But this movie stands apart -- it SUCKED!\\n\\nAnd it was only mildly surprising to see Disney going after \\\"traditional morality\\\" in its whole \\\"the old ways need to die so we can move forward together in a new direction\\\" recurring theme. Gee\\, I wonder if there's a deeper agenda there?\\n\\nBut even if we throw this deeper concern out\\, the movie was just ridiculous for its many moments like Leia's sudden regaining consciousness in the cold hard vacuum of space and self-propulsion back onto the ship and (later) BB-8 piloting a two-legged walker and blowing away stormtroopers in the bay of Snoke's ruined ship that Finn and Rose miraculously survived in even though HUNDREDS of armor-wearing stormtroopers had (of course) died when the Mon Calamari star cruiser jumped to hyperspace right through there -- REALLY!?!?! And Luke was pathetic from beginning to end.\\n\\nThe only I reason I give it 2 stars is there were some awesome special effects and some good story-telling moments between the stupid scenes. I fear Disney will ultimately destroy this franchise when the next installment comes out\\, complete with a lamely-resurrected Snoke. And they'll have to resurrect him\\, because not even the idiots at Disney would leave Kylo Ren in charge.","true":true}
