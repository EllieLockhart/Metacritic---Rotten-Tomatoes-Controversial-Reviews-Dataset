Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite negative audience reviews this is one of the best Star Wars to date coming only behind The Empire Strikes Back and last years epic Rogue One. It's a shame there are those who down play it because it wasn't what they were expecting. Having seen it four times already I can say it gets better with every viewing and my guess is once all is revealed in Episode IX it could possibly be even better.","true":true}
