Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed this movie when I first watched it\\, and even tried defending it from it's ardent detractors\\, however I quickly came to realize that said-detractors were actually right all along. The Last Jedi may be bold and subversive\\, but it's a mess too. The film's character's motivations and behaviors erratically change whenever the story desires\\, it's (admittedly intriguing) deconstruction of the balance in the force is confusing and contradictory\\, and the disregard it has for it's predecessor(s) makes this installment all the more frustrating and unlikable. The constantly shifting tone\\, nonsensical plotting (such as Holdo refusing to reveal her plan to her crew)\\, and pointless sub-plots and characters don't help.","true":true}
