Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie just destroyed everything that Star Wars was. Took all the hero\u2019s and made them losers. Won\u2019t be seeing any more Star Wars movies directed by this guy. ","true":true}
