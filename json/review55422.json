Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mark Hamill does an excellent job with his acting; however\\, the director\\, Lucasfilm\\, and Disney have destroyed the character of Luke Skywalker.  I understand the new trilogy should have new characters\\, but to take a beloved heroic character and tear him down and make him unrecognizable to longtime fans is unforgivable.  This will be my last Disney Star Wars movie.  There are many more issues with the film\\, but this is the one issue that has made me realize that it's best for me to stick to the original trilogy and leave the new movies to people who enjoy them.  I do not enjoy films where every male character does not know what he is doing and has to be taught a lesson by female characters.   I'm tired of this agenda against strong male characters.  Can't there be both male and female characters that are strong and interesting?  Not where Disney is concerned.","true":true}
