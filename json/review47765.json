Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When the makers of the movie don't care about the universe or the characters\\, happens movies like the Last Jedi. Disrespectful for the actors\\, for the original makers of the amazing movies of Star Wars and of the audience. Unsuprising and unoriginal story. The new characters like Rose and good-riddance-Holdo are as useful as Jar-Jar\\, but lamer. \\n\\nThis is not even worth of being called Star Wars. When the Star Wars stories like Rogue One and Solo are better than an add to the main storyline\\, then you just know\\, that this is not the way to go.","true":true}
