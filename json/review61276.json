The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I thought I was prepared for everything\\, but to say that this was an unwelcome surprise is an understatement. I knew that the last of us series is dark and its expected that it would get darker with the most obvious expectation that one of the main characters would die or be incapacitated in some way (Joel was the laziest choice in my opinion) and the way they died would probably be gruesome and dark. But to just randomly introduce a character that noone knows just to up and kill joel for little more than shock value and then forcing the player to play as her to try to \\\"understand\\\" her is one of the worst writings i have ever seen. I had problems with other scenes like the sex scene which was just unnecessary in my opinion\\, the obvious attempt to appeal to SJWs by just making ellie gay and abby as transgender with no contribution to the plot\\,  everyone being a female and Naughtdog refusing to kill females otherwise they might receive hate\\, and the overall plot that starts off weak and ends with literally nothing accomplished and noone dead. I loved the Last of Us for the setting\\, the characters\\, the beautiful but dark vibe\\, some decent gameplay\\, but most importantly the plot. It's sad to say that all of these aspects have felt downgraded with the only redeeming quality is a slightly better gameplay and visuals.\r\rTLDR: If you want to play a decent zombie apocalypse game then this game delivers if you can ignore the entirety of the plot\\, but if you are here for story\\, good characters\\, good writing\\, and are a fan of the last of us series and looking for the same if not better quality game than the first one then this game will exceed your worst expectations. I heard alot of bad things about NaughtyDog\\, but I was willing to put all that aside as long as they stick to focusing on making good games\\, but this game has left me dissapointed\\, getting a refund\\, and never supporting this terrible company and I encourage you all to do the same\u2026 Expand","true":true}
