Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrendously bad. \\n\\nYeah\\, my first review\\, but when I saw the critics 91% rating\\, I had to set the story straight. \\n\\nNot quite the same emotion as leaving The Phantom Menace ... a feeling of pointlessness mixed with depression. Good actors wasted and a saga trashed by yesterday's nobody - Rian WTF???\\n\\nWhy the rating? Well ignoring the plot holes and awkward\\, cringe worthy humour (the prank call scene)\\, there was a departure from what is accepted Star Wars lore ... a Jedi never gives up. What they did with Luke Skywalker was unforgivable.\\n\\nThankfully it as not (yet another) retelling of the SW episode IV tale - no super-weapons. But there were pointless diversions; the trip to the casino planet to free the horses (& not the child slaves!) which was ultimately a waste of time; Leia's Mary Poppins moment in space; Benicio DT's pointless cameo; Laura Dern's weird hairdo and pointless plan that any droid could have done ...\\n\\nDisappointing. One day they will make a film that betters its trailer ... in a galaxy far\\, far away.","true":true}
