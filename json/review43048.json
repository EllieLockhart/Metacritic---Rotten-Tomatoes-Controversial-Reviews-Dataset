Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was very mixed. The visuals were great and some of the plot was good but some of the subplots and characters made no sense and did not add anything to the story. The movie seemed poorly thought out and poorly written many times. There is no way it should receive a 93%\\, that is banana's. How much did Disney pay these critics and sites to promote the movie?","true":true}
