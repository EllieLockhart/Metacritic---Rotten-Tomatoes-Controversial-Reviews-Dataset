I am a die hard Last of Us 1 fan and came to love this sequel more than the original.  The story goes to some difficult places but it is absolutely a worthy successor to the classic that is the first game.

Everyone has their own opinions they are entitled to and this one is mine; between the roller coaster story and addicting gameplay I don't see how anyone could hate the game.

Please play this game\\, I promise you will leave the experience having learned something new about yourself and what it means to be alive.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
