Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it\\, even more so after a second viewing. At first I had a hard time accepting where the story went\\, especially in regards to Luke. But\\, to quote Kylo\\, it\u2019s time to \u201clet the past die\u201d. What most of us love about Star Wars is the seemingly limitless possibilities in that galaxy far\\, far away. In this movie\\, we learn that the force is much more expansive than we first believed\\, and that it\u2019s real power isn\u2019t limited by the Jedi\u2019s narrow interpretation of it. Finally\\, we get to witness something Obi-Wan referred to so many years ago when Luke becomes \u201cmore powerful than [we] can possibly imagine\u201d. Don\u2019t limit your own view of what you believe these movies should be\\, and enjoy the ride!","true":true}
