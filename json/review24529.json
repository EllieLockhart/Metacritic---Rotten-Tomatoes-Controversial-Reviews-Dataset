Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Most people who like the film are saying don't hate it because it is different. That is not the reason why I hate it! I love the new characters in Rey and Kylo\\, but the way they dismantled legends from the original trilogy is dreadful. Let the past die? Let this movie die. Terrible writing.","true":true}
