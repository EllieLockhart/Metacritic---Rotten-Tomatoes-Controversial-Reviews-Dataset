Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Grew up with the originals. Found the prequels to be a bit off but totally respected most of the story lines. Liked TFA - was very emotion despite some flaws in it. Enjoyed Rogue as a pure stand alone that lightly tied into the universe. Though this movie was totally off base - thought maybe I had a bad night. So much promise such a wasted effort... most of it is covered in the .5-2 star ratings. Left TFA rejuvenated - left this sad.","true":true}
