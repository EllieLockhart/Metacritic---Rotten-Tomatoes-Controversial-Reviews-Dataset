Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Left the cinema feeling amazing ... but looking back and thinking about the film I don't know what RJ was doing ... lack of knowledge on the Star Wars film ... terrible jokes and also a very bad plot ... only thing looking back that was good was Mark Hamil and Reys scenes ... I hope JJ can clean the mess RJ has left behind","true":true}
