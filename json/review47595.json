Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What they did to Luke in this movie is a disgrace and the Casino scene is terrible. First Star Wars movie I've seen in the theater where I left feeling disappointed and sad because of how bad it was. If they would have put in as much effort into the story and character development as they did Liberal Propaganda this movie would have been amazing.","true":true}
