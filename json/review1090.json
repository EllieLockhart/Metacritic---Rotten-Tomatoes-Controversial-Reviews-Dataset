Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An underwhelming second installment in the new trilogy and a 'luke' warm 8th installment in this epic saga. This films weak narrative and complete lack of a cohesive engaging plot leads little and yet too much to think on. The usage of thrilling reveals\\, that enhance films such as Empire Strikes Back\\, here drag this film into the ground\\, failing to shock and undermining previous installments. And yet it would be foolish of me to not credit some incredible performances from an extremely talented cast\\, the design of some all inspiring set pieces\\, and mind-blowing special effects. This along with the reality of the prequels demonstrating how bad a BAD Star Wars film can truly be\\, allows the film to (just) scrape into the already growing list of over-hyped\\, underwhelming\\, well-made yet disappointing films of 2017. Disney still has a long way to go before it captures the magic of the original trilogy.","true":true}
