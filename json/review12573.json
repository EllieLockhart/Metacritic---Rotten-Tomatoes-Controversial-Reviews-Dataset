Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can tell maybe that some people Might Not like this film and to me I have my own Problems to the movie But I still Think It's a Fun Star Wars Movie!","true":true}
