Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Simply outstanding. Game of the year\\, without a doubt.\r\rThe Last of Us 2 seems to have divided gamers - like marmite\\, you either love it or hate it. I certainly fall into the \\\"love it\\\" category\\, but I didn't to begin with.\r\rThe story took a bizarre turn.. one that was difficult to swallow at first. But the game found a way to gradually and subtly change your whole perspective on the story\\, the characters and ultimately what is right and wrong or that blurred grey area in-between.\r\rHaving spent some time reading through the negative reviews.. they all have the resounding tone of grief. People are not grieving a poor story-line\\, but grieving that the storyline did not map out how it was \\\"supposed to\\\" in their head. Good stories are supposed to make you feel something - and this game did exactly that. However\\, making individuals feel negative emotions from playing your game will not yield the same 10\/10 ratings that you got from the first game.\rLet's not forget\\, we effectively doomed the world to suffer a zombie infected apocalypse when a cure was within reach.. yet that felt pretty good\\, Joel was the hero\\, right? No\\, he wasn't\\, far from it.\r\rThe gameplay was nothing short of flawless\\, keeping you in suspense at all times whilst improving on the AI and combat of the previous game.\r\rWithout a doubt\\, this is a must-play.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
