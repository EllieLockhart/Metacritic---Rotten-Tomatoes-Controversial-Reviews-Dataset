Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The blending of the old with the new and the action with the drama makes this one of the best of the series so far. I found it more watchable but still a bit confusing\\, too long and sometimes a bit too dark. Rey is the new heroine of the series and I found her platonic relationship with Finn and his partnership with Rose to be an interesting sort of triangle. Kylo is a star turn for Adam Driver who has always seems younger than his 34 years.","true":true}
