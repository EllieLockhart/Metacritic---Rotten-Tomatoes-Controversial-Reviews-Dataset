Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By fat the worst Star Wars movie of all time. There are endless plot holes and character flaws that make it incredibly difficult to watch. And no\\, I'm not saying this cause I'm some fat\\, white male\\, basement dwelling\\, woman hater. And it's not because I don't like change. This movie genuinely sucked on multiple levels and destroyed much of the lore created in TFA. Sure\\, it had great music and graphics\\, but that's it. What makes it harder to watch is how Rian Johnson\\, Kathleen Kennedy\\, and J.J. Abrams responded to the criticism by saying it was bots and then it was sexist fat white men. Plus\\, Kathleen Kennedy said she killed off Luke because women couldn't relate to him and his story? To me\\, that is sexist because I believe anyone can relate to anyone's story and be inspired. Anyways\\, this movie is trash and I will not be buying it.","true":true}
