Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie had the potential to be memorable. Instead\\, it wasted a lot of the awesome storytelling potential created by The Force Awakens. More importantly\\, the movie gave no internal explanations or logic for some important and risky developments. For instance\\, Snoke is killed before we can hear anything about his background or anything that would have made him different from Emperor Palpatine. Critically\\, we get no explanation for Luke Skywalker's abrupt change\\, from the hopeful hero willing to sacrifice himself to revive the good in Darth Vader\\, to a fallen Jedi Master willing to kill his apprentice because of his possible dark side inclinations. Without a major explanation\\, this change destroyed one of the most awesome heroes in cinema history. This unforgivable sin earns this movie 1.5\/5 stars.","true":true}
