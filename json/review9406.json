Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Glad to see Mark Hamill sold out to the Disney empire. Tossing lightsabers. Hiding from the empire and denying the force. What a piece of garbage movie. Odds on bet they bring back jar jar in the next movie. The only movie true to the star wars universe post Episode IV was rouge one and even that one had issues.","true":true}
