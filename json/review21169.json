Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was very dissapointed by this movie. The force awakens was a passing grade for me\\, very enjoyable and setting up some mysteries for the next ones. TLJ hurts TFA\\, by making the end scene with Luke just a  setup for a joke. Both biggest mysteries from TFA are dismissed by this movie ( spoiler alert:  who Snoke was and Reys parents). Even making the text crawl useless because this movie starts at the end of TFA.  Not only that\\, the leia \\\"shooting star\\\" scene is laughable\\, and most hurtful of all\\,  THERE ARE NO FEARSOME BAD GUYS\\, remember when darth vader  was a force to be recon with?  Of corse you do\\, we all saw rogue one and the hallway scene. Now we have  comic relief with the villains. I think the Audience Score speak by it's self\\, been surpassed by THE PHANTOM MENACE. In Fact\\,  if this is the future of star wars suddenly I appreciate more the prequels. Last but not least\\, I am male\\, o love jyn erso in rogue one\\, Love leia (when she is not mary popping around) and I loved rey both in TFA and TLJ\\, but I fell like I cannot relate to anyone here\\,  luke is a X-hole\\, poe is a hot headed male stereotype\\, and finn got like 2 swings worth of epicness in the worlds shortest  payback battle\\, please make one good male character\\, I'm not even asking to have a male lead\\, just one smart badass male character\\, or give the ones we already have something to do. I just hope that SOLO is as good as rogue one.","true":true}
