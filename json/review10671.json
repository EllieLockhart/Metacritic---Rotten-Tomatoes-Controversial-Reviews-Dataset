Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had many friends tell me this movie was bad. Although I had high hopes seeing the 91% review. I also saw many five star ratings even though it is at 46% for audience score. I just watched it and was amazed\\, how much this is not Star Wars. Looked at reviews again and can easily tell someone keeps making profiles to give it 5 stars. Also wondered how critics gave it 91%? Found out many are employed to companies related to Disney. The 5 star ratings could be a little more creative to hide there tracks? Sadly that will never change how bad this movie was. I am sad to see what happened to the story of Star Wars.","true":true}
