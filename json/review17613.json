Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I start this by saying that I am a huge Star Wars fanatic\\, this movie is garbage. It's the result of the slow disneyfication of this historic universe\\, turning it from a master piece into a steaming pile of S*** mixed with a lot of cheap jokes and gags pandering to all the eight year olds in the audience. Star Wars as we knew it is gone. R.I.P.","true":true}
