Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"These movies have went exactly the way I did not want this franchise to go. Terrible acting and the whole plot and story line just seemed to stumble along without fluidity. Should have stayed home and watched Netflix.","true":true}
