Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is awfule. Every character makes ungodly stupid decisions\\, Luke Skywalker is butchered completely to unrecognizable proportions\\, the casino scene is a borish pile of trash\\, Rose is one of the worst virtue signals in casting I've ever seen\\, Rae is a Mary Sue\\, Kylo Ren is whiny and unappealing\\, the story doesn't connect with the previous 7 films at all\\, there is now coherent plot\\, Lea flying like superman is dumb\\, Snoke had absolutely no context\\, the action is poorly paced\\, the jokes are so forced (no pun intended)\\, screw porgs\\, but worst of all this movie is a heaping pile of leftist propaganda garbage. All I can say is that I want my money back and will no be attending any further sequels.","true":true}
