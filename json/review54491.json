Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie. It felt star warsy\\, but it also felt fresh at the same time. I see people complaining that there is a lack of a story. They say it feels like it goes in a big circle. But you know what? I'm cool with that. This movie is a wild ride\\, with a lot of fun and funny moments. However\\, it doesn't skimp on the serious notes either. I thought it was well balanced. And while I didn't bust a gut watching it\\, I got a chuckle or two. Best of all it adds to the Canon in star wars\\, it adds more story for me to gobble up\\, it adds new creatures\\, new locales\\, new characters. Who doesn't love new content? \\n\\nAll in all\\, I thought the movie did well\\, there were a couple of parts that kind of came off as silly. But overall it was amazing.","true":true}
