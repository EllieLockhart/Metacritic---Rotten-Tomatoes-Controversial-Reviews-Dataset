Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This really hurts to say\\, but the main issue i have with this game is that the story feels like a first draft and the narratives are rushed in many ways\\, such as ---'s death\\, Abby's perspective and the constant back-and-forth of the story (along with a disappointingly linear game with potential).\r\ri loved the last of us 1 and completed it start to finish the day before i got this gameThis really hurts to say\\, but the main issue i have with this game is that the story feels like a first draft and the narratives are rushed in many ways\\, such as ---'s death\\, Abby's perspective and the constant back-and-forth of the story (along with a disappointingly linear game with potential).\r\ri loved the last of us 1 and completed it start to finish the day before i got this game (as well as completing it 3 other times). So i can confidently say that whilst the graphics\\, game play\\, ai and environments are 10\/10\\, the story is weak and rips you away from your favorite characters yet fails to treat new characters well enough like Abby or Jesse.\r\rA lot of the problems is with how Abby's narrative was portrayed\\, we are given very little time to sympathies with her\\, especially with the fact that Joel actually saves her life and Ellie begs for his life. So when the game forces the player to play as her for half the game and rip you away from an Ellie revenge story it feels disappointing to the trailer expectations and hype.\r\rAbout 2 hours into the game (without seeing the leaks or many trailers to go in blind) i thought the game was going to go for an open-world survival horror story\\, where the player can hunt down each of the people responsible to find Abby\\, whilst infected and WLFs exist in an open world that Ellie needs to traverse to find supplies and the targets. Sounds cool? yea i wish the game continued this way but it dosnt...\r\r...the game unfortunately gets linear again after about 50 mins of a fantastic open world area where the player can go where they want\\, get supplies\\, find treasures\/clues\/puzzles\\, be attacked completely out the blue by enemies (like one time at a workbench which was crazy cool)\\, but then this ends and its back to being linear.\r\rthis is where the story fails\\, as when many of targets are killed\\, i simply don't remember or recognize who they are\\, the initial act of the game is rushed and you wont remember who the people are whom Ellie kills until they are dead. Even characters like Ellie are treated like Dina's rebound and Tommy is gone except for probably 6 minutes of screen time.\r\rTo conclude\\, i am very disappointed after 7 years and probably unlimited funds from Sony that they made a weak story line (that was very predictable in areas) and a surprisingly linear game.\r\rThere is a reason why 'The Last of Us' does not have Part 1 in its title\\, it was a concluded story with Ellie's acceptance of Joel's lie. A bittersweet ending that did not need a brutal ending for characters and a first draft story with so many back and forths.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
