Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Excellent made movie. I am sick of the people who cried that the prequels were different than Original\\, that TFA was too much like the Original and now crying about the TLJ is totally different. Well guess what from the prequels to the original 20 years passed from the original to the TFA 30 years passed. Now tell me if we go by real life where you the same person you were 20 years ago? How about 30 years ago. Now include that to a whole galaxy? Anyways I just want to say stop being ridiculous they are just movies not real life...","true":true}
