Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pros: Great visuals. Luke was great. Kylo was amazing. Rey was great. Poe was great. Leia was great. BB-8 is unstoppable. Cons: I didn\u2019t like the Finn and rose story line. I also felt like the pacing was off\\, and they through to many new stuff at the audience. They didn\u2019t flesh out characters as well. For a film over 2hr 30min it feels very short. It doesn\u2019t feel as big as \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d The humor was off and to direct in some scenes. They should have kept Luke until episode 9. What are they gonna do with Leia? Carrie Fisher is dead in real life.","true":true}
