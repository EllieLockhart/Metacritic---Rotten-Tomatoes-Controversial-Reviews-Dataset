Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"has almost no true plot\\, ruins characters that fans have grown up loving\\, decisions made by the heroes have no logic.  Now they have no major villain nor do they have the major hero.  Not sure where they can go from here\\,.  Ben Solo is a boring and nonthreatening bad guy.  Where is the tension\\, or story at all? I've been a huge fan for 30 years\\, and I am left wishing they had never made these new movies.  I would rather they had left the extended universe in the books and stayed away from this sad attempt.","true":true}
