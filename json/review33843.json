Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible. Ok so you want to start fresh? Disregard the legacy and everything set into place by The Force Awakens? THEN DO A GOOD JOB. Which you didn't. This is not just an awful movie\\, and not just a failed sequel\\, this is an act of aggression against fans by an arrogant director who thinks he can do better. He couldn't. Now let's hope that Abrams can pull off a miracle in IX and pick up the pieces. (And thank you Mark Hamill for letting us know your feelings about this film.)","true":true}
