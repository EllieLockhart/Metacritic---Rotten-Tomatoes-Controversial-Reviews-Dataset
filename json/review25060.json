Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My wife and I thought this was a great movie. Our only critique would be that it was a little long\\, but that may be because of the 25 minutes of previews before the movie even started!\\n\\nI thought the whole controversial ending with Luke was actually perfect. Very well done\\, and necessary to move the story along into the future. I liked that it did some things that were unexpected and not predictable in the Star Wars world. \\n\\nI would definitely see this again.","true":true}
