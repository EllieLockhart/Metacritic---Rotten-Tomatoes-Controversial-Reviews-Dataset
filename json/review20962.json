Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was hesitant when The Force Awakens came out. I had high hopes for this movie. And I was utterly disappointed.\\n\\nTo begin with... no light saber fights. This renders it to a not Star Wars movie already.\\n\\nSecond: If I buy a ticket I want to be entertained\\, I am not interested in the makers or studios political opinion.\\n\\nThird Un-needed slapstick comedy.\\n\\nFourth: The movie was just badly written\\, badly directed and just was about ruining J.J. Abrams's achievements. Probably out of hurt pride.\\n\\nThis basically is the death star with Mickey Mouse ears.\\n\\nThanks Disney fr taking a dump on my childhood. I will never ever watch anything from you ever again.","true":true}
