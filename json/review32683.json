{"101487":170264,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-03-24","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the eighth instalment in the Star Wars franchise and is directed by Rian Johnson (who also directed Brick (2008)\\, Looper (2012) and a couple of Breaking Bad episodes\\, one of which is the highly rated \\\"Ozymandias\\\" episode). It carries on from the events we see take place in The Force Awakens\\, following Rey\\, Finn\\, Kylo Ren and others. At the time of me writing this blog\\, it has been just over a month since its release in the UK and it's fair to say that the reception amongst critics and fans is mixed\\, which I completely understand. When I came out of the cinema after my first viewing\\, my initial reaction was that it was going to divide audiences as it was so different from previous Star Wars films we had seen.\\n\\nOriginally\\, the idea was the The Last Jedi was being talked about as the equivalent to The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\\, which I can assure you\\, it isn't and I believe this is why some people didn't enjoy this movie. I personally had a lot of fun with this film despite having very mixed feelings about it after my first watch. It's unusual for myself to review a \\\"still in theatres\\\" film after going to see it a couple of times\\, I normally try and get my review done off of my first impressions. However because of how torn I felt about this film\\, I felt I wouldn't be capable of writing a valid and knowledgable review.\\n\\nThe first point I would like to discuss is the cinematography in this film. It's evident the influence that Akira Kurosawa and old samurai films (such as Seven Samurai\\, 1954) had on Rian Johnson\\, especially with relation to the framing of the lightsaber fights. The scene in Snoke's throne room with Kylo\\, Rey and the Praetorian Guards is arguably one of the best lightsaber battles that we have seen in the entire saga. I feel that the choreography in that scene is definitely some of the sharpest that we have ever scene in the galaxy of Star Wars; it has the balance of being well paced and cleanly performed\\, without being over-the-top like we saw in the prequel trilogy.\\n\\nThere are a number of shots that have stuck with me since I saw the film as standing out as a beautiful composited shot. Luke training Rey on the side of the island; Leia looking out across Krate waiting for the First Order; Luke standing face to face with the entire First Order as well as facing Kylo Ren and so on. Although there is one that really is head and shoulders above the rest and i'm certain you know the one I mean. When Vice Admiral Holdo fires the rebel cruiser at light speed through Snoke's ship. The use (or lack of) sound in these few shots is absolutely mesmerising and\\, being the only silent moment in the film\\, really has a phenomenal impact. For me\\, that shot is probably\\, if not\\, the best shot in the entire saga when you are discussing the sheer beauty within the frame.\\n\\nThere is one character in particular for me that really stood out for me in this film and\\, I feel\\, they drastically improved since The Force Awakens; and that is Kylo Ren. First of all\\, I want to commend Adam Driver for the stellar performance that he gives. When I watched The Force Awakens\\, I will shamefully admit that I wasn't a fan of Kylo Ren. I felt that he was too much with his tantrums and mental instability while also trying to be like Darth Vader; I thought he was trying to have too many layers to his character. In The Last Jedi\\, Kylo ditches the \\\"wannabe Vader\\\" side of his character which then allows his psychopathic instability to flourish. Post Episode 8\\, I internally debated for many hours about who I believe is the greater villain within the Star Wars universe\\, and I have come to the decision that I personally prefer Kylo Ren. Now calm down! I can sense your impending anger and confusion but allow me to explain. Vader was iconic because he was a mysterious\\, intimidating character that the audience had no knowledge; not even whether he took human form or not. This automatically creates intrigue\\, meaning that when his eventual decision to save Luke happens\\, it's very easy to root for him because he is just a darn cool character. Apart from that\\, there isn't truly much development of his character and his motivations remain constant throughout the originals. Kylo\\, on the other hand\\, has so much more depth to him. I really felt the internal struggle and battle that he was having with himself; I get the impression that he isn't concerned about the First Order or the Resistance. Instead\\, he just wants to rule the galaxy alongside Rey. He wanted to be as great and as feared as Darth Vader was\\, while at the same time creating his own legacy\\, which he failed to do while imitating his grandfather. Personally\\, I felt that Kylo Ren completely stole the film\\, but then again\\, i've always had a soft spot for great film villains.\\n\\nA key part of Kylo's development in this film is the moment that he killed Supreme Leader Snoke in a very intense scene. After my first viewing\\, I was angered that Snoke had been outwitted by Kylo so easily and that the time that was spent building him up as the \\\"big bad\\\" in The Force Awakens had been wasted. As Snoke is portrayed as being very powerful with the dark side of the force when throwing General Hux and Rey around\\, as well as knocking Kylo off of his feet. I felt it was strange that he wouldn't be able to sense what Kylo was up to and almost cheated by what J.J Abrams had set up.\\nUpon second viewing\\, this 'nit-pick' wasn't as irritating as it originally was. In fact\\, I looked at this creative decision in a completely different way. I now feel that if we were to go into the third film of the \\\"new\\\" trilogy\\, then it would very much feel like Episode 9 was going to be a rehash of The Return of the Jedi. The decision to kill Snoke I believe gives J.J Abrams the opportunity to create a completely unique Star Wars film\\, which I believe is a positive thing. There is still part of me that is disappointed that Snoke is unlikely to be around in Episode 9 and\\, despite the build up he had (granted\\, he was drastically hyped by the theorising fans)\\, his limited screen time; I am now even more interested in how the story will all be tied together.\\n\\nLinking back to Kylo\\, (sorry to keep going on about him but as you can probably tell\\, i'm quite fond of the psychopathic sith... sithchopathic!) there is an interesting choice to have a force bridge between him and Rey throughout the film\\, allowing them to communicate. This was one of the developments of the film that I really liked during my first viewing. It allowed both characters to express how they were feeling while also keeping it original and not have a voice-over or them talking to themselves to do this. Having them link\\, which Snoke later explains was his doing\\, allows you to analyse deeper until this point about why they can communicate. My thoughts were \\\"Maybe they're related? Maybe they're destiny is to end up ruling together? Maybe they're equals on either side of the force?\\\"\\, the possibilities were endless and really made it difficult to determine which direction the film was going to head in. In general\\, this aspect was a nice addition that showed that the force is more complex than we originally thought\\, while highlighting the importance of both the characters within the balance of it.\\n\\nFrom Rey and Kylo's connection\\, we discover the truth about Rey's parentage and how she ended up on Jakku in the first place. Between the gap of The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi there were many theories about who Rey's parents could be\\, whether she was part of the Skywalker bloodline or even part of the Kenobi family; others even thought that she was the daughter of Han and Leia. In The Last Jedi we learn that Rey's parents are in fact nobodies; unrelated to the greater story and nobody of relevance. This was something that I didn't see predicted anywhere on the internet and\\, to be honest\\, was not something that I was expecting. Nonetheless\\, I think this is probably the smartest decision that Rian Johnson made when writing the screenplay for this film. If Rey had somehow been tied in to the families that the Star Wars saga is built around; it would have felt way too coincidental and unrealistic (in a world of space battles and space samurai). The idea that the force can rise in anyone is much stronger than it being hereditary and will always keep the franchise open to further instalments without the need of a Skywalker\\, Solo or Kenobi. As Snoke says in the throne room \\\"As the darkness rises\\, the light to meet it\\\" (or something like that)\\, implying that there is always balance in the force and that it will balance itself out by making being available in those it needs to be for it to be equal across the galaxy. By setting this up\\, it keeps the door open for the boy we see at the end of the film back on Canto Bight to return to the franchise in later Episodes further down the line\\, if we ever get there\\, or even spin offs. Overall\\, a very\\, very good direction to take Rey's character\\, one of which gets a big thumbs up from me!\\n\\nI would like to tell you that we're almost at the end\\, but we aren't yet.\\n\\nJust quickly\\, I would like to say how John Williams\\, yet again\\, nails the score for this film. Of course\\, we have the classic music that is in every Star Wars film\\, but the themes of Kylo\\, Luke and even Rose (we'll get to her) is very solid. Despite how incredible the world of Star Wars is\\, it has always been the inventiveness and consistently outstanding work that John Williams produces every time that really brings it all to life for me. His score makes the 'feel good' moments\\, great; and the sad moments\\, heartbreaking. I believe that every Star Wars fan is in agreement that the saga wouldn't be the same without the iconic work of legendary composer\\, John Williams.\\n\\nNow\\, someone I haven't mentioned much so far\\, yet was arguably the most anticipated character everyone wanted to see in The Force Awakens\\, yet left everyone disappointed when he only made a small appearance right at the end. That is of course\\, Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker. As has been reported by everyone\\, Mr. Hamill is extremely good in this very different portrayal of Luke. It's no secret that Mark Hamill wasn't convinced with the direction that Rian Johnson had written Luke in this film and I understand why he would have felt that way. It is very surprising seeing how Luke threw the lightsaber\\, which hadn't been seen since Cloud City\\, over his shoulder with no questions about how it came into Rey's possession (we'll get to that too). His behaviour and attitude towards the ongoing battle between the First Order and the Resistance isn't what I would have expected of the Luke I came to love in the original trilogy. Despite this\\, I really enjoyed the way Luke had changed in the 30 years between The Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens. It reminded me of the path that of Master Yoda; going from a serious Jedi Master to a witty\\, yet bonkers recluse.\\nOf course\\, there is one scene in particular that has been universally well received by everyone; and that is the returning force ghost of the aforementioned Yoda. I wish I could share with you the feeling of nostalgia and sheer joy as I saw the little green jedi return. It was a nice callback to the previous films that makes them feel even more connected as a saga. Another callback that tied in nicely to the narrative was R2-D2 showing Luke the message Leia sent to Obi-Wan Kenobi back in Star Wars; the way Luke calls it out as well as being a \\\"cheap shot\\\" is also a clever way of acknowledging it\\, without it sounding generic or cheesy.\\nThere was much speculation around The Last Jedi about whether this will be Leia's last appearance in the franchise after the very sad and unfortunate passing of Carrie Fisher. I thought that we would see Leia's final moments at some point and I was certain of it when she gets blown into space by a TIE fighter. To the surprise of everyone in my midnight screening\\, Leia finally puts an end to the theories of whether she has the force or not by \\\"Mary Poppins\\\" (yes\\, that's a thing now) her way back to the rebel cruiser. At first\\, I wasn't pleasantly surprised to see this; I felt that it was too much of a sudden coincidence that she could tap into the force at that moment\\, but not in the previous 5 films in which she features. This was a part of the film that stuck with me long after my first screening; does it make sense? Why now? So I decided to go back and rewatch the original trilogy for little pieces that could potentially hint at Leia being connected with the force. To my bewilderment\\, there are slight nods that could be interpreted as such\\, the most obvious being her ability to sense Luke in Cloud City. So does it fit? Is it possible? In my opinion\\, yes!\\nSo Leia survives Episode 8\\, unexpectedly. Luke\\, on the other hand\\, appears to meet his end. I was quite taken back by this. As much as I thought we were going to see the death of a Skywalker child\\, I didn't really want to see it. After Han Solo's death in The Force Awakens\\, I didn't want to the \\\"new\\\" trilogy to fall into the pattern of killing a member of the original cast of in each film as this would have been too predictable. Plus\\, Han's death was way too difficult to deal with and I didn't think I could handle another! After a \\\"force portrayal\\\"\\, buying the remaining Resistance time to escape to oncoming First Order. Luke seems to have given all that he can and becomes one with\\, into what I interpreted as\\, the force. I don't usually like to make my predictions of the future films public\\, however I will be extremely shocked if we don't see Luke again as a force ghost to guide Rey when she needs him\\, just as Yoda did for him in Episode 6. Again\\, the brief confrontation between Luke and Kylo is stunningly shot and choreographed on the picturesque planet of Krate. Knowing what I know now\\, it's a rewarding inclusion to have Luke not leave any footprints on the surface\\, that i'm sure a few keen-eyed viewers spotted\\, hinting at what is to come. The obvious clues are the return of the previously broken blue lightsaber and the younger looking Luke. Upon further thought\\, I assumed that Luke portrayed himself in such a way because that would have been the way Leia remembered him\\, before he went into exile. Overall\\, Luke was a huge positive for me\\, his presence is one I was very much looking forward before release and I feel I was justly rewarded.\\n\\nUnfortunately I must cover the areas of the film that I don't feel worked and still bugs me slightly as to why these were included in the film. The first\\, and most obvious one\\, is the B story involving Finn and Rose's journey onto Canto Bight to find the master codebreaker\\, who is bought about by the slight\\, and unnecessary reappearance of Maz. Sparking from Finn's stale motivation that has carried over from The Force Awakens\\, as he attempts to flee the First Order by sneaking away from the Resistance\\, before getting caught by Rose. This entire arc isn't just boring and clear filler\\, but it absolutely bombs the pacing of the film. Every time we are with Finn and Rose\\, all I want is to go back to Rey and Luke or Poe; who might I say is awesome yet again. Oscar Isaac is quickly becoming one of my favourite actors as he is constantly great. The idea that Poe was meant to die during the crash on Jakku at the start of Episode 7 is jaw-dropping as he has become one of my favourite aspects of the new trilogy; but back to my original point. To me\\, Canto Bight feels to much like somewhere on Earth\\, which immediately limits my investment in this storyline. Worst of all\\, this journey they go on doesn't contribute to the overall story arc of the film at all as they fail in recruiting the help of the master codebreaker. A part of this arc is the confrontation of Finn and Captain Phasma\\, which suggests that we have seen the end of \\\"chrome dome\\\"\\, and honestly I hope it is. In both films she has appeared\\, she has felt wasted. I get similar vibes that she is the modern version of Boba Fett; she has cool armour but doesn't actually do much with it. We see that her armour is \\\"laser-proof\\\" which gives an explanation for her different apparel\\, but then ponders the question \\\"why don't all stormtroopers have laser-proof armour?\\\". This was hopefully the last we will see of the underdeveloped character\\, although we didn't see anything definitive so the door is still open for her to appear in Episode 9.\\nFinn did have the opportunity for redemption\\, however\\, while on Krate. He could have gone out like a hero by flying a \\\"junk bucket\\\" into the laser-cannon (apologies as I am unable to remember its actual name). It is set-up nicely with all the other pilots aborting the mission\\, with Finn being the only one to remain on course. At the last second\\, Rose flies in to prevent Finn from sacrificing himself. I feel that\\, even though Finn's journey in this episode is lacklustre\\, it would have been a fitting way for John Boyega to depart the franchise. This capped off what was the most disappointing segment of the film.\\n\\nThe next issue I had with the film revolves around Luke's lightsaber return in The Force Awakens still not being explained. When Maz passes over the lightsaber to Rey and co. in Episode 7\\, she is asked by Han where she got it\\, to which she replies \\\"A good question\\, for another time\\\". In my opinion\\, The Last Jedi was the right time. The fact that Luke has now passed and the saber broken\\, it looks unlikely to me that this question will be answered\\, but I hope that i'm wrong. A plot hole that I feel will be difficult to explain in convincing and realistic fashion\\, but we shall see.\\n\\nMy biggest worry going into The Last Jedi was the introduction of the Porgs. Beforehand\\, they seemed to be included purely for the merchandise that they'll be used for and I still feel that way now. They appear every now and then for a slight laugh and to keep the tone relatively light\\, but nothing more than that. This film really didn't need them in\\, for me\\, they were the Ewoks and I hope that we won't see them again\\, but as they have infested the Millennium Falcon\\, it's likely that they will be on the screen again.\\n\\nAll in all\\, I wasn't sold on this film after my first screening\\, but rewatching it improved it drastically for me. I was able to compose my thoughts and then reevaluate a second time. It's a film that has moments of excellence and moments of despair. Don't get me wrong\\, I really enjoyed this film and I will be pre-ordering it on Blu-ray\\, but unfortunately it fell into the pool of films where its downfall is due to its hype. As a film student and maker\\, i'm obviously very excited to see how this story will conclude in the 2019 release and will be\\, yet again\\, attending the midnight screening. Hopefully we get a similar extraordinary spectacle that answers some of the questions that are yet to be resolved\\, with J.J Abrams back directing\\, i'm confident that the untitled Episode 9 is in safe hands.","true":true}
