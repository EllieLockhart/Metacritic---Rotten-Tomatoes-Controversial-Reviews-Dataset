Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its an actual attempt to make a movie with proper visuals and developed characters. Its not perfect. It does have plot holes and stupid situations but its still a good watch.\\n\\nI feel the low ratings is a product of people now only recognizing memes and winks like in marvel movies.","true":true}
