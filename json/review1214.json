Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A poor excuse for a Star Wars  film. Picks up all the threads of plot seeded in 7 and gives 'em a good yank before setting them on fire. The new director seemed only to want to ruin everything the last director set up. Nothing pays off\\, every plot point is ruinously misused\\, And hey... The only living original character is the only dead actor... Go figure.","true":true}
