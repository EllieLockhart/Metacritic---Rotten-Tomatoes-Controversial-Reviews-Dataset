Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible movie\\, Plot\\, History and So much politics for a Movie.\\nDestroy the Franchise and Slap the Fans and Totally anti-men movie without sense. All males looks dumbs or get killed. No happy as male. I believe on equality but this is just an insult to all us.","true":true}
