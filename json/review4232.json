Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By far the worst of the new Star Wars movies. Does NOT feel like Star Wars and one of the worst movies I have seen in the last year. If I could I would \\\"unsee\\\" this peace of \\\"art\\\".\\n1 star just because Mark and Carrie was in the movie. Will not be watching episode 9.","true":true}
