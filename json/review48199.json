Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Whilst The Force Awakens felt like a reimagined of A New Hope\\, this feels like it\u0092s own movie. \\n\\nI\u0092m surprised by the low user rating. I loved it. Enough spectacular aerial battles\\, strong female characters (take your daughters!)\\, the mystical magic of the Force\\, a brilliant lightsaber fight and it was funny. It\u0092s Star Wars so the dialogue is never going to be great and the acting won\u0092t win awards. But it was brilliant. Go and see it and make your own mind up","true":true}
