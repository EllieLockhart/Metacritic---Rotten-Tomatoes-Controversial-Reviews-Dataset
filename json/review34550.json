Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best thing about this movie is that the fans finally seem to have had enough. Hollywood and the review system couldn't have been exposed better for their corruption. 93 Tomato score my ass! This movie is an insult to the Star Wars fan base. The people who made it clearly have a contempt for the fans\\, and I feel sorry for those who say it's any good because they are like abused children who love their abusive parents. The other good thing is it flat out exposes how most critics are bought and  paid for. It's depressing to know that Disney has recently bought another major studio because they clearly have the majority of critics in their pockets. Yeah DC movies suck\\, but guess what. They suck no more than many of the Disney related movies like this that seem to get rubber stamped with 90% plus scores on this site. This is the first time I've seen the audience scores reflect they've had enough and see the man behind the curtain.","true":true}
