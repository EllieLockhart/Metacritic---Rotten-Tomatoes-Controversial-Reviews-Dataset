Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"OK. I'm not a fan of the last few but this one especially. What has happened to the clever banter\\, the charming characters\\, and well thought out story arcs. CGI\\, Fluffy characters\\, and good visuals don't for a good story make. Uuuurgh Disney\\, you screwed up. It's gotten progressively worse but this is an all time 'meh'.","true":true}
