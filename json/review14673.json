Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never been more disappointed in a movie. From ridiculous plot points to character archs that go no wheee to plot choices that do nothing to inspire caring in the movie goer\\, this movie is a hot mess. I have seen every Star Wars movie at least 20 times. I will see this one once and pray never again.","true":true}
