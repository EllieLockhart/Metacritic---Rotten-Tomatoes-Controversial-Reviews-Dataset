Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was terrible. I don't say that because of how happy or sad it was\\, or because it did or didn't confirm any of my pet theories. It was awful because its plot was completely incoherent (even after the normal level of Star Wars hand-waving)\\, the themes of its different subplots were directly contradictory\\, and every character evolved into a less interesting version of themselves. Rey\\, in particular\\, went from a pretty reasonable character in TFA to a cardboard cutout Mary Sue. \\n\\nOn top of that\\, it was boring. This movie could have easily been cut down to an hour and a half without losing anything. Everything Finn does in this movie could have been cut out and nothing of value would be lost. This movie focuses on subverting your expectations\\, and ends up something like a photo-negative of Star Wars: it has all of the faults and camp of the originals but none of their redeeming virtues. After this\\, I don't have any hope at all for the rest of the series.","true":true}
