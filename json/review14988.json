Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just want to let everyone know that the battle which is being fought here is a very important one. Don't be fooled by the apparent insignificance of it.\\n\\nEvery honest moviegoer who signed on Rotten Tomatoes just to let the world know that this movie sucks is fighting against the most powerful movie production studio on earth and its paid critics JUST TO RESTORE TRUTH.\\n\\nLots of moviegoers felt insulted and slapped in the face by this abomination of a movie. Their motivation to come here is to let the world know how bad this movie is and how better is for anyone not to watch it. What they do is a service to other people. They try to warn other people that watching this movie may actually hurt them badly.\\n\\nWhat is\\, instead\\, the real motivation for people who show up here just to throw a one-liner basically saying that this is the best Star Wars movie ever and give it 5 stars? May I suggest money?\\n\\nLook at the stunning 91% Tomatometer and then look at the embarrassing 48% audience score (which\\, if math is not an opinion\\, given the hundreds of pages with all negative scores\\, should be around 20%\\, Rotten Tomatoes I'm talking to you!).\\n\\nSomething is fishy\\, isn't it?\\n\\nIf you dare to say that this movie sucks\\, you are immediately labeled as racist\\, sexist\\, fascist\\, male chauvinist\\, unable to bear a strong woman in command and so on and on.\\nTheir tactic is really awful\\, but it works. The critics who are not paid to lie are too scared of being labeled like that\\, so they will perpetuate their lies\\, even knowing that this behavior will stain their credibility forever.\\n\\nWe are fighting for the Truth\\, the one with the capital T\\, here.\\n\\nThis is why I am asking you\\, the casual moviegoer who did not subscribe to Rotten Tomatoes yet\\, to sign up and voice your rage against Disney\\, Kathleen Kennedy and her meek boot-licker and amateur director Rian Johnson. They ruined a beloved childhood fairy tale. They raped us all.\\n\\nPlease help the Truth prevail. Help us sink the audience score of this abominable movie to the point where even professional critics will not be scared anymore and will come out to say that this movie is as bad as it can be.","true":true}
