Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some will struggle liking this film simply because they can\u2019t accept letting go of the past particularly their view of Luke. This definitely is a movie made for current times. I think it ranks 4th in my opinion but I actually enjoyed it more than Force Awakens because it was more unpredictable.","true":true}
