{"101487":159187,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-24","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok where to begin...\\n\\nI am not a particularly huge Star Wars fanboy but I do no the difference between a good and bad movie in a series. I do recommend going to see this movie just because it is Star Wars and if you don't you'll fall behind\\, but don't pay an extra $40 for a opening night seat like I did\\, you'll feel like you got scammed. \\n\\nPros:\\nIt was original and different. Not a lot of movies have the guts to create an original and different movie\\, especially when you have a huge fanbase and hype for a movie like this. \\n\\nThe dynamic between Kylo and Rey was amazing. The tension\\, the arguing\\, the back and forth dialogue between the two is perfect. Both are trying so hard to win the other onto their side\\, and it creates the perfect chemistry between the two. \\n\\nThe fights. The fight scene between the Praetorian Guards and Kylo and Rey was the best part of the movie. You could see and feel the synergy between them and it was amazingly choreographed. \\n\\nCons:\\n\\nDestroys literally everything that is set up in The Force Awakens. Examples: Rey's Parents\\, Snoke's Origins\\, and the Knights of Ren\\, etc. These are all either not included or are wasted. Fans or even casual moviegoers have speculated what the answers to these questions are for the past year while waiting for this movie after TFA\\, but none of these questions are given a satisfactory answer.\\n\\nWaste of characters. Let's are honest\\, Finn\\, Rose\\, Snoke\\, Chewie\\, Leia\\, Phasma\\, and even Luke\\, are all wasted. Finn and Rose are given this secret mission which ends up being useless and having no point at all to complete. Snoke is immediately killed and betrayed by his own apprentice\\, Kylo\\, even though Snoke is portrayed as extremely powerful\\, (obviously more powerful than Kylo)\\, and yet he is struck down more easily than a Porg. Chewie is just left out\\, we see him for maybe a total of 5 scenes then he's gone. Leia... What the F*ck did I just watch. She just floated through space using the force?????????? What? How did she survive the initial blast? When did she learn to use the force in that way? In all honesty\\, she should have died\\, and it should have been glorious instead of clinging her on to these movies and making her death in Episode 9 garbage. Phasma was utterlly wasted. She beats down Finn in a fight\\, then whoops\\, he's still alive\\, and then gets knocked into a pit of doom. In my opinion\\, they should have instead had Phasma chase Finn and Rose during their mission\\, and have it like ROTJ\\, where the force sensitive people are on the ship dueling and trying to persuade each other to join their side\\, while the non-force sensitive people\\, are off doing another mission while being attacked by the First Order. That way\\, Phasma and Finn can have a battle after there's already a build up of them running and fighting through the streets of Canto Bight. Luke has no reason to die in that way. He should have died in a lightsaber battle or sacrificing himself to save Rey\\, in real life\\, not through a dumbass projection. \\n\\nPlot. The entire main plot of the story\\, or the reason why the resistance isn't immediately dead is because they are on a ship that is being tracked by the First Order and are running out of fuel. The First Order could easily just lightspeed ahead of the ship and cut them off or anything. Like\\, what are you doing? Why are you letting them stay ahead? Just have one of the 5 ships lightspeed infront of the resistance cruiser and then ambush it.\\n\\nToo many cheesy lines in the beginning. <-- Self explanitory. \\n \\n\\nConclusion: Meh. It was okay. Better than the prequels\\, worse than the original trilogy. TFA and Rogue One. Plot was boring and long. Wasted characters and hype built up from TFA. Rey is still a Mary Sue (overpowered nobody). Snoke is wasted. Luke is wasted. Phasma is wasted. Leia is alive? Finn is wasted. Rose is wasted. Po is actually not too badly wasted. Chewie? He was in this movie? Right right right\\, he was in \\\"those scenes\\\".","true":true}
