Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I feel Johnson wasted the potential plotline of the Force Awakens and the earlier films for something that I feel did not work and it puzzles me that the Lucasfilm story group allowed this film to be done. I am cautiously optimistic for IX but Lucasfilm should have been incorporating not just the original trilogy but also the prequels to these final films in the saga. I hope they bring proper closure to the original saga and respect what came before. The mantra of killling the past in this movie is one of the worst things I ever heard. It reminds me of my idiot classmates in school that would not watch anything that was older than them. Oh Well.","true":true}
