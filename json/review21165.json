Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was very disappointed with this installment. I waited so long for the last Jedi and after watching it I felt like I wasted my money. There were some good scenes but that was mostly towards the end. Most of the scenes were point less and when fin and rose were riding those animals it almost felt like an avatar movie\\, but that wasn't the worst of it. Leia surviving in space and using the force to float back into the ship was the point where I made my mind about this one. I watched the force awakens about 4 times in the theatre but I will not be watching the last Jedi again.","true":true}
