{"101487":148125,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just as Empire was poorly received and rose from the ashes\\, so will The Last Jedi.  A fresh take on Star Wars that isn't afraid to take risks\\, expand on characters and delivers some solid action.  The twists feel more natural and make more sense upon repeat viewings.  No film is perfect (One story line in particular makes the story drag a bit) but overall an impressive filming achievement that challenges our understanding of  the Force and the Star Wars universe.  Gets better with every repeat viewing.","true":true}
