We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"If it is compared to the rest of the AAA games that are out there it is a definitive 10\\, there is no other game that can be compared in gameplay except MGS V\\, and if we talk about graphics it is the best that exists today it is almost  not to believe that it is running on a PS4 and not on an RTX\\, the audio quality is just as sublime the audio is so good that it becomes something that is part of the same gameplay and gives total immersion\\, listening to the Seattle rain is  more impressive to be a PS4 which the audio is not as good as it was on ps3 and the music of Gustavo Santaolalla because we all know how good it is\\, the art design\\, needless to say\\, it is the best of the game just like  it was in the first\\, artificial intelligence is one of the best there is\\, enemies are always alert\\, they communicate with each other\\, they flank you\\, they track you down and they notice if something is wrong or if a partner is missing\\, in addition to going in front of  an enemy or being exposed for a long time is very complicated\\,  one thing for sure is that it is the game with the best lighting system (not RT) of all\\, and the characters (except for the unmentionable) are very good\\, Dina\\, Jessie\\, Owen or Lev have very defined personalities and can be empathized  and feel interest very easily\\, and if we talk about the voice acting work this is something that was already a guarantee of excellence with the actors that we know lend the voice\\, and if we play on the subject of animations it is definitely the most natural and refined that  It exists so much so that people came to think that the gameplay trailer was cinematic because it was not to be believed\\, the studio animations are to date the best in the industry. The game when compared to everything that exists out there is a 10 without problems\\, there are not many games with this level of quality.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
