Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Highlander 2 of the Star Wars saga. They could slap the Star Wars logo on an episode of TeleTubbies and make millions of dollars\\, which The Last Jedi ably demonstrates. While watching this movie\\, I got the distinct impression that Rian Johnson thinks that the whole concept of Star Wars is stupid and that anyone who likes them is a fool; he basically said as much in the character's dialog. It tried too hard to be it's own spoof. The slap-stick comedy was not only out of place\\, but just not funny. I half expected to see Yoda do a dance number and Ewoks piloting starfighters. The characters were shallow and forced. I didn't care about any of them and found several annoying and revolting. Even considering that Star Wars is a story with laser swords and space magic\\, at least the previous movies were internally consistent and allowed for willing suspension of disbelief.  This movie had too many moments that were ridiculous and beyond even the realities of the made-up universe. Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill visibly didn't want to be there. Deliberately vandalizing what others enjoy is not art\\, nor a \\\"bold new direction.\\\" The Last Jedi is a slap-stick\\, cartoonish\\, puerile mess with the consistency of Michael Bay's Transformers and the emotional weight of Beverly Hills Cop 3. Fan fic at its self-congratulating worst.","true":true}
