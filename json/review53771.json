Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"great great movie\\, but SPOILER:\\n\\nOverall great acting\\, great cast\\, great compatibility\\, but why oh why did the plot change so much\\, we were all curious who snoke is\\, how Kylo REN became REN and what the heck REN actually is?  none of these were answered.  I would also like to point out the skywalker saber that has been passed down from \\\"luke and it was his fathers before him!\\\" ended up in the hands of a random girl? I pray that this is a hoax of a lie given to Rey to discourage her\\,  The entire universe was based on Skywalkers is now going to just be deluded because the characters are getting old and Disney wants to reboot the whole name.  Then why include them at all? Why destroy the legacy of the Chosen One? why ignore the role completely\\, why not answer the questions of what that whole title was about and actually complete the sagas? I hope these things are answered in 9 and that the saga will not end with a clash of new vs old all in an attempt to make a franchise that can be squeezed of all possible profits.  Please Disney\\, hear our complaints.  Again Great movie\\, great character building\\, just an empty plot.  JJ\\, you can fix this!","true":true}
