Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With a useless first hour\/hour an a half and continuous poor acting from the lead\\, its a wonder how anyone could justify anything half-decent from the shambling\\, half finished mess that is 'STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI'","true":true}
