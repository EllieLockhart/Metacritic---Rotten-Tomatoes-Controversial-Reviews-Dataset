Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a complete disaster of a film.   First of let me say that I am NOT a paid internet troll.  I am in fact a thoroughbred Star Wars fan.  I grew up watching the original trilogy\\, the prequels came out at the height of my fandom\\, my brother and I played the collectible card game\\, and I have read a handful of the extended universe novels.   I thoroughly enjoyed The Force Awakens and Rogue One.  I thought they were well done.  So this is not a matter of me just being anti-Disney.  This film\\, The Last Jedi\\, was just undeniably terrible.  There was essentially no plot.  Not a single one of the characters was done justice in any way.  The writing was disjointed and uninteresting.  The \\\"humor\\\" was just bad.  This film was such a travesty that I can hardly understand how\\, with such vast money and resources\\, Disney allowed this film to hit the screens in the way that it did.  This is not to mention the absolutely underwhelming and disappointing conclusion to Luke Skywalker's character.  I am not sure exactly who is responsible for these issues but if it is Rian Johnson\\, then by god do not let this man near a movie set ever again.  If I could give 0 stars\\, I would have.  Do not pay money to watch this film.  I have little hope that Episode 9 will be able to remedy the glaring and stupid mistakes that were made in this movie.","true":true}
