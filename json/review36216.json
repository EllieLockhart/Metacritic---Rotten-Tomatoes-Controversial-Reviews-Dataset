Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last jedi was the first star wars movie outside the trilogy to make me angry and disgusted at the people who made it for the complete destruction of luke's character because an edgy director thought it be such a cool concept.","true":true}
