Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is probably the best Star Wars film since Empire and Ep.4. I say this because The Disney version of what we all Love has become solidified in telling its own story in its own way\\, and it works. Other fans will bash this because it is so different and they Will not understand the risk this film took in its story telling. If we all got what we expected this film to be what good would it do as far as making it special. I enjoyed the last Jedi because of its dark yet friendly tone. R.i.p Carrie Fisher! ","true":true}
