Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All hype and no substance. Disney doing their best to destroy the original story and characters in hope of replacing with their on batch. The new characters will not have the staying power of the originals.","true":true}
