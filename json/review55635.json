Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not the usual Star Wars movies. About 45 minutes of sub plot could've been cut from this movie and spent more time on developing what everyone actually wanted to see would've created a more impactful experience in the world. Alot of angry star Wars fans complaining about the plot direction and decisions characters made are foolish. They're right in that this didn't feel like a star Wars movie\\, simply because unlike where previous movies in the franchise left you in the dark to solve mystery\\, and fill in gaps with your own curiosity and imagination\\, this movie made bold decisions and showed you the decision and it's consequences without any shadow of a doubt. For once Star Wars fans left the theatre with little to no questions to ask\\, and a slap of deliberate and fairly complete story progression. This movie feels all over the place\\, the sub plots and progression don't all flow well together and feel disjointed unlike episode 7 which Abrams fantastically wove together a complete experience even if it didn't break any ground. A movie with this type of plot and progression handled in a manner that 7 was handled with would be a perfect star Wars movie which hopefully we're in store for for episode 9. Ambitious and decisive in any series known for mystery and allusion has rubbed hardcore fans the wrong way when it shouldn't. There is a fully director driven experience here with no rope to play in any direction\\, and that story is solid and interesting\\, beautiful and entertaining\\, sloppy at points\\, and even if not what everyone wanted from their star Wars or favourite characters\\, it's quite good if you can accept it. Mark Hamill is fantastic\\, for those who complain about Luke's character direction they have spent too much time alone in their basements ignoring mirrors to not recognize the accuracy and parallels between his attitude and their hatred for the movie.","true":true}
