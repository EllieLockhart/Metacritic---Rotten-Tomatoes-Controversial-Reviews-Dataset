Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't listen to the negative reviews. There are flaws in this movie\\, but people are wildly over reacting because the plot was not their personal fan theory come to life. It is a beautifully shot film with some very strong character development. Top 3 for favorite Star Wars films. If people see it with an open mind they will be pleasantly surprised","true":true}
