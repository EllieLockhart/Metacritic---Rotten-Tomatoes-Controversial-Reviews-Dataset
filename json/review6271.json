Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney is ruining Star Wars by milking the brand in which George Lucas made. There is no clear concise story from Episode VI to the new trilogy. Kylo Ren's \\\"Let old things die\\\" montra throughout the film was the picture's battle cry; Episode VIII was an attack on the backbone of Star Wars lore built by the original trilogy.","true":true}
