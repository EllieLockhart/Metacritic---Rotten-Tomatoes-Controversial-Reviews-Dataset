Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I feel somewhat conned.  I told myself I wouldn't rush out to see this film\\, I would wait to see what the consensus was.  The consensus seemed positive from the early reviews and\\, afraid of spoilers\\, I went to see it the day it opened.\\n\\nLeaving the theatre I thought\\, 'Is that it?'\\n\\nThere are good performances (especially by Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher) but no character seems to get enough screentime for me to empathise and get behind their plight.\\n\\nFinn's subplot felt like it was just to give him something to do.  You could remove that entirely and I wouldn't miss it.  I wonder if\\, had Poe Dameron been killed in TFA like planned\\, whether his stuff would have been given to Finn to do.  You could have amalgamated those characters and shaved 30 minutes from this film.\\n\\nThe 'surprising twists' all the early reviews went on about were so telegraphed I saw them coming a mile off.  I cared little for the characters (and it felt as though the film didn't care much for them either) so it was difficult\\, particularly given their small amount of screentime\\, to invest myself in their plight.\\n\\nI was so happy when I thought JJ Abrams had brought Star Wars back so effectively.  I did not expect Rian Johnson to then bugger it up.\\n\\nThis guy's directing a new trilogy?  Pass.","true":true}
