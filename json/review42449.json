Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a farce. The major theme of the movie was \\\"Let the past die.\\\" - Kylo Ren. Well that is exactly what Rian Johnson did. He Killed the past's heroes as far as the Star Wars universe goes.\\nAbrams set him up with several mysteries to explore with Snoke\\, with Rey's parents\\, how did Maz end up with Luke's ESB light saber\\, etc\\, etc\\,.\\nBut Johnson thumbed his nose at Abrams\\, Lucas and the fans who had high hopes for this movie; that turned out to be nothing more than a PC-ified liberal agenda propaganda flick that assassinated the Star Wars legacy. I didn't feel like I was watching a Star Wars movie\\, i felt as though I was watching a poorly conceived fan-fic chock full of wish fulfillment and Mary Sues abound while the heroes of the past 30 years are just swept away like they never mattered. A large portion of which were wiped out with a single line of dialogue. (all the male heroes of the resistance Admiral Ackbar etc etc).\\nThe only reason I gave a full star is that there were a few great visual moments in the film. Too bad they weren't back up with substance. \\nAs far as what made the movie bad\\, there is just WAYYYYYY too much to list.","true":true}
