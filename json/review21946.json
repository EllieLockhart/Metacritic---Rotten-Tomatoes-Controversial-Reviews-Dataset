Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just seen the premier. Is it the best Star Wars movie? No. It has plot holes\\, is 15mins too long and doesn't give any backstory to the most powerful character of any of the Star Wars movies. Having said that battles are truly epic with plenty of emotional moments and more importantly it moves the story along with the batten being well and truly passed to the next  generation. To all the trolls and haters giving reviews go crawl back under the slimy stone you came out from.","true":true}
