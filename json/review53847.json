Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Here the thing that many people forget when watching Star Wars. All of the characters that we know and love are still humans. As such\\, they are prone to making human mistakes and being utter idiots\\, like all of us can be sometimes. The Last Jedi does an excellent job at making everything\\, nott necessarily likeable\\, but real.  Mark Hamil does an excellent job at portraying Luke in a difficult phase of his life. The shock and utter emotion of the entire film blew me away. I loved it! Don't let others opinions of the movie deter you from loosing yourself in the story. Go and enjoy it! Then form your own opinion of how you think it was. I hope you have a great time seeing the continuation of the Skywalker Saga.","true":true}
