Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is what a good middle movie should be. It resolves some questions as it begins at the end of the Force Awakens but doesn't finish the story. The movie excels at giving a sense of the stakes. A few elements seemed out of place. The Last Jedi does an excellent job of subverting viewers expectations and taking the Saga in a new direction.","true":true}
