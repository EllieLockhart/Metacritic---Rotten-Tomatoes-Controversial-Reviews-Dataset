Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was far from perfect\\, but it by no means deserves the backlash it gets. The editing was jarring\\, the side stories were tacked-on and unnecessary\\, the jokes were out of place\\, but the experience was enjoyable. Characters made questionable choices\\, as did the team working on the movie\\, but all in all\\, it was okay. The movie is something of a loving middle finger to elitists who want things their way\\, and director Rian Johnson deserves some recognition for taking a bold step that\\, frankly\\, today's film culture needed. This movie is not your father's Star Wars\\, but it doesn't need to be. There are legitimate complaints to be made about it\\, such as pacing and the writing at certain parts\\, but most of the complaints coming in are nothing more than the whining of petulant fanboys\\, offended that their vision was ignored. Again\\, The Last Jedi is a flawed movie\\, but its bold strokes\\, stunning visuals\\, and occasionally stellar characterization\\, more than make up for it. It will just take some time before the fanbase will calm down enough to realize that.","true":true}
