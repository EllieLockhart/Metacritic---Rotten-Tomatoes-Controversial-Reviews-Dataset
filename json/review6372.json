Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney\\, rian Johnson\\, and jj abrams have ruined Star Wars. I wasn't happy with the remake of force awakens but it was well done and I get why they did it.  Even then\\, it painted this new trilogy in the same corner as the original trilogy.  They should have went in new direction from the start.  Same old rebels vs empire BS. Now\\, we get this overly long the last Jedi with characters we don't care about and poor treatment to Han\/Luke\/leia legacy.  Couldn't any of them been shown to enjoy anything after Rotj?  That's beside the point.  On any level of film criticism\\, the last Jedi is not a well made movie. Slowest speed chase in movie history.   Only kind of memorable scenes were Kyle\/Rey fight and Luke in the end.  This is the worst of the 9 films to date.","true":true}
