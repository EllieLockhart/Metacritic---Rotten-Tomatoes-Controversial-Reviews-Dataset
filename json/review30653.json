{"101487":167169,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Since critics failed at their job  with this movie. I need to contribute something to expose this atrocious film. People who like this film should try looking at this film from \\\"fake drama\\\" perspective if they are willing to learn why there are people that hate it.\\n\\nThe whole running from first order sequence makes no sense. First a convenient hyperspace tracker is convenient. Second\\, even with tracker\\, the best course of action for resistance fleet is still spreading out and going into hyperspace. First order forces would either be split up for pursuit or focusing on bigger targets like Raddus. The point is here that you don't need special tactics even with an Ex Machina as big as hyperspace tracker.\\nSplit into groups\\, jump to populated planets\\, dump the ship and blend in with the crowd. Standard guerilla tactics which Resistance should be very familiar with by now\\, and it is way better than staying together as sitting ducks  until fuels run out. For this chasing to happen\\, somehow they have to stay together\\, fuels have to be introduced\\, first order ships need to be slower than resistance ships \\, and tie fighters cannot be scrambled. The problem with using extra plot devices is that it made things complicated and is prone to producing plot holes like you  can maintain momentum in space without using fuel. \\n\\nThis is a major plot of the film\\, and yet it feels unnecessary and contrived\\, just like the bomber introduced -- slow\\, easy target\\, sitting duck when dropping bombs which makes no sense  because no gravity\\, and there is already B-wing that can do the job better.\\n\\nThis is just an example of how poor the writing is. Scenes that would otherwise have no reason to be there are there by plot contrivance. This is a pattern throughout the movie. Rian Johnson wants the tension\\, but he doesn't want to pay for it by writing a coherent plot without absurd plot devices\\, so nothing felt like earned. \\n\\nAs another example\\, look how Rian Johnson did with Luke. First he needed the tension\\, and what is the most lazy way to do it? Make him do something he would never do. It creates huge tension alright  because audience would go like \\\"why? what happened!?\\\".\\nBut this tension comes with the risk of character assassination if not handled properly. \\nWhat are Rian Johnson's efforts in building up this? Scenes of Luke attempting to murder his nephew for lamest reason possible which as usual introduces more questions than it answers\\, such as why Luke having thought of killing his nephew leads to that Jedi needs to end. It's not like Jedi orders Luke to kill his nephew. Also Luke IS Jedi order at this point\\, he could make whatever rules as he sees fit. But no Rian Johnson told you that  because of that mistake he decided to let the Snoke rule supreme\\, let Kylo murder innocent as he goes\\, and let his sister die. No\\, this won't happen. Not in movie\\, not in real life\\, Luke Skywalker or anyone else. This is NOT what you would expect for human behavior. As mentioned\\, Rian Johnson wants the scene and tension yet he did not want to pay the price for further explaining the motivation and consequences \\, or even why he came to Jedi island to die instead of everywhere else. A more blatant example of his lazy writing is when Luke came to burn the Jedi text which he did not destroy for all the years he was on the island\\, Yoda popped up and gave him a lesson which he could've given at any given time for all these years he was on the island. Then SUDDENLY Luke wanted to protect those texts even just seconds ago he war carrying a torch to burn it! Again he wants the tension\\, with little regard to continuity or if the plot makes sense.\\n\\nIf director does not want to pay for it\\, WHY SHOULD WE?\\n\\nNot to mention\\, all the serious moments are undermined by his jokes. TONE\\, Rian Johnson\\, what is your TONE of the movie? Failure is the best teacher and Rian Johnson should learn from this dumpster fire of a movie.\\n\\nAnother major plot is where Rey conveniently found out there's good in Kylo Ren. Same thing happened here again as it happened throughout the movie. The setup is some force Skype call which only first appeared in this movie. OK. Even this were the case\\, despite that we still don't know what's Kylo's reason of being bad\\, Why is that ALL OF  A SUDDEN Rey has to go to turn Kylo at this moment? She hated him just hours ago in movie time and now she wants to turn him to the good side? Fine. Then why now?\\nWhen you are next to Luke who you came here for help in the first place\\, even though he is reluctant to help. It is at this moment that Rey thought \\\"OK this seems a good time to turn Kylo Ren\\, it's not like I have more important things to do\\, and it's not like he or Snoke would hurt me\\, and it's not like I have any leverage I can use\\\". Did Rey read the script!?\\nShe didn't even bother appealing to Kylo's good side\\, like \\\"let go of your hate\\\". Not to mention this is a huge rip-off of ROTJ. Nowadays critics don't call this stealing\\, they call this subversive. That is on top of the fact that Supermecy\\, the flag ship of first order\\, is like a kitchen is this movie where everybody comes and go as they please.\\n\\nThese are just some examples\\, I'm not even getting started. But this should give you some perspective on why this movie makes no sense\\, and people who like it may have viewed it differently once they stop assuming haters don't get the in-your-face message like \\\"capitalism is bad\\\" or \\\"Luke came back from failure and saved the republic\\\". \\nTake whatever bullshit backstory Rian Johnson feed you with a grain of salt\\, just like I did above\\, you may start to see that it breaks apart. \\n\\nOh\\, for those \\\"This is the best Luke I've ever seen\\\". I recommend you watch Transformers episode 3\\, 4\\, 5. It would have blown your mind on how character development is done.","true":true}
