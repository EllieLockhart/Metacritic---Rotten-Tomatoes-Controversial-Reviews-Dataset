Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi as an original story was intriguing\\, however as a sequel to The Force Awakens.  It was a step backwards.  Snoke by far has to be the most wasted villain in any franchise I have ever seen.  Certain characters do not get justice\\, especially after waiting over a decade plus years to finally see them on screen.  I believe if you new to the franchise then The Last Jedi just might be for you but if are a fan of the original series episodes IV\\, V\\, and VI then you might feel that your child hood was shredded apart.  I give it 2.5 out of 5.","true":true}
