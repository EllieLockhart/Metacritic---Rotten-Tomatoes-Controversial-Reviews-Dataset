Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This Star Wars was a complete departure from the series thus far and it was fantastic. I was extremely worried in the opening credits\\, when the infamous yellow letters scrolled up from the bottom of screen I read what sounded like a copy of \\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\" and I was so disappointed. Then the movie unfolded and had me hooked. The complexities within the movie were deep and really shook the foundations of how I saw Star Wars. I really don't understand the criticism of this movie\\, I thought it did everything right. I went in with high expectations that were blown out of the water. Everything I expected to happen was turned on its head in a great way. This is one of the best Star Wars movies of all time.","true":true}
