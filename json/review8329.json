Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"fell well short of what I expected after the force awakens. very psyched took the day off from work to see the movie walked out completely In A Daze. tons of plot holes and some parts just didn't make sense. the disagreements I have with this movie not being a hater and no one was wanting that movie to be better than I did it just didn't happen.","true":true}
