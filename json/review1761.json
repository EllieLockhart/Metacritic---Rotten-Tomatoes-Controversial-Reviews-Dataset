Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a Star Wars fan\\, I saw this as the poorest\\, most childish\\, most ridiculous and absurd movie in the 40 year history of the franchise.\\n\\nAs a German\\, I saw the socio-political messaging as part of ubiquitous effort to force everyone to conform to the same way of thinking and speaking. The oppressive 'progressive' agenda that is trying to control the narrative in the West today is 100% against liberty\\, freedom of speech\\, speaking the truth even if it is an uncomfortable truth and confronting Fascism (whether Far Right Fascism or lsIamofacism). \\n\\nToday's so-called 'liberals' are like new Nazis. But films like this unintentionally wake people up to whats going on because they are not subtle enough.","true":true}
