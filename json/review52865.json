Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Although some despise this movie for its wild departures from the norm\\, I applaud its bravery. The sprawling long scenes served not as a disjointed mess but as a reminder that life is not one straight storyline where everything is connected. The universe is massive and a movie about a versatile galaxy deserves to depict different flavors. It wasn\u2019t my favorite Star Wars movie but it was by no means the worst. It reminded me why I love Star Wars so much- because it took risks and opened doors. Science fiction is meant to reflect society today and I think it did a wonderful job drawing parallels. Highly recommended. ","true":true}
