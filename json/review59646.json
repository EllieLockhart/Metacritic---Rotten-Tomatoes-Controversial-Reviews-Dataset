In a world where survival prevails\\, neither ellie nor joel nor abby are good or bad people.\rJoel killed a lot of people in the first game and it is normal for other people to take justice.

Joel saved Ellie without asking her opinion.\r\rThe fights are the best Naughty Dog has produced\\, light years from the first game. The animations are shocking\\, literally. The best in the industry.\rAnd the most impressive thing is how ND has achieved this level of detail and spectacularity in a simple PS4.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
