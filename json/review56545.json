Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi had great acting for the most part and beautiful cinematography. The problem is the writing and editing\\, the numerous plot holes make the movie longer than it should be and less great than it could be. Johnson takes lots of freedom to tell the story how he feels fit to tell it and that ends up being contradictory to The Force Awakens which is disappointing. You won't notice the flaws unless you start to analyze it though which is probably why fans are so angry. Lucasfilm should take note that creators should faithfully make movies to the subject matter.","true":true}
