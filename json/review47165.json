Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a mess of a \\\"Star Wars\\\" movie-horrible pacing\\, mediocre script\\, very superficial characters\\, major plot holes and almost no continuity from some of characters past from TFA\\, too much slapstick comedy. Overhyped\\, poorly developed and too long of a movie.","true":true}
