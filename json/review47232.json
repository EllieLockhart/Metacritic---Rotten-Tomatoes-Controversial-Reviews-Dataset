Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a piece of leftist\/feminazi crap. I'm just done with Star Wars from here on out! It pains me too because I've been a lifelong fan. R.I.P. Star Wars!! Fire Kathleen Kennedy and everyone who had a hand in making these SJW Star Wars movies.","true":true}
