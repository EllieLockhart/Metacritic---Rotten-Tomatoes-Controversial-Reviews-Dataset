Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not someone who usually rates or comments on films\\, but this movie is a disgrace.\\n\\nComing from a massive fan over the years\\, this film ruins everything that was ever good about the Star Wars saga. Disney and Rian (especially) should be ashamed of themselves for producing such a terrible\\, childish\\, rushed sell out of a sequel to this iconic saga. The fact that Rian wanted to make a film for himself and not what the fans wanted says it all.\\n\\nI will not state all the bad views on the film\\, because majority of the bad reviews already state what is wrong with it.\\n\\nSo why rate the film bad? And why should we show our disapproval? Because if we do not state these things\\, the franchise will only continue to spiral into mediocrity and poor quality. All for the sake of a major company like Disney making loads of money\\, rushing out a new bland film every year full of CGI and no depth.\\n\\nFilms like Return of the Jedi & The Empire Strikes Back were iconic for their time\\, because they were based on STORYTELLING.\\n\\nOf course the franchise cannot repeat itself to be successful and it must evolve to stay fresh. HOWEVER\\, if you take out the formula from what made Star Wars a great franchise\\, then the film is no longer Star Wars. It is a mediocre\\, washed out idea\\, of what the franchise once was. Disrespecting the legacy of previous films.\\n\\nAnd what has made this series so successful is that creativity has taken the front seat time and time again\\, to push the envelope. If LucasFilm wanted to evolve this series\\, then the expanded universe should've been taken seriously instead of being thrown in the trash.\\n\\nI do believe we will see great Star Wars films in the future that are great\\, but if we as fans and movie-goers do not speak up. It will eventually become the destruction of a once great movie series. \\n\\nPlease continue to speak up and show these big corporations that storytelling and creativity must always be in the forefront. Because without creativity and imagination\\, future generations will never understand the value of amazing storytelling. That is Star Wars.","true":true}
