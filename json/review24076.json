Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Massive disappointment. I'm a big Rian Johnson fan. Brick is a classic and Looper was great. So I had hopes that he would be able to overcome all the shortcomings of JJ Abrams' highly derivative and unoriginal The Force Awakens. \\n\\nUnfortunately\\, it doesn't. Not only that\\, but there are entire storylines that are pointless and have no effect on the outcome of the story. Every hope I had for this story was shattered.  Now I'm not even sure I want to watch Episode 9.","true":true}
