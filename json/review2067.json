Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A Star Wars movie that doesn't just pander to fans or regurgitate familiar movie formulas. Finally a Star Wars movie with depth that doesn't glorify hot shot heroes and reveals the dark truths about war and power. I'm a lifelong Star Wars fan and I feel as if this might be the best movie of the franchise to date. ","true":true}
