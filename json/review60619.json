The madness that Ellie have\\, and the anger she feel towards Abby feels so real\\, you play an entire game with Joel and she kills he with a club. But later you undestand her motives. The violence of the war between SCARS and WOLFS is simply impressive. And the final enemies with their torture methods are so sadic that I really loved it\\, this is a history of revenge and its consequences\\, she lost everyone she loved one time\\, her major fear was this\\, being alone\\, thing Ellie earned with the promises she make and the acts she comitts.\rTo resume\\, the best graphics game i've ever played\\, it didnt betrayed the first game in style\\, and the fact Ellie lose 2 fingers\\, so she cannot play the guitar (the unique object she kepts from joel\\, also his watch) is the pay for all the anger she one time had. 9\/10\u2026 Expand","true":true}
