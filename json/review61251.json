I fell in love with the original for its story and atmosphere. It was something the had been done before in games\\, but the sum of its parts made it a game that for me was almost a 10\/10 for me.

I don't give a crap if a character is gay or trans\\, but what matters is that they are wrote as a human being first not just some token character that we get so much of in today's media\\, but what we got was this....trainwreck.\r\rAs I said I wanted to like this game\\, I really did. This game had the potential to tell a great story. It tells a story\\, but the story it tells fell flat for me. Without going into details\\, I love a revenge plot. I have seen so many in movies and other games\\, but this one dropped the ball hard.  However\\, I am not wanting to spoil the game for anyone out of respect for the players\\, not the company or its marketing.\r\rThis could have been a great sequel if it wasn't handled so poorly. Abby could have been a good character if they handled it better\\, Joel was all-but squandered\\, but Ellie I enjoyed. It was good to see her grow up\\, but then the last half of the game.....urgh.\r\rThat's why I have to give this game a 4. Graphically its fine\\, a good 7 out of 10\\, Gameplay is the same 7 out of 10\\,  Story is an abysmal 3 out of 10. If this was a different IP I might have scored it higher with a 5 out of 10 or a 6. Yet\\, this is not a new IP. This is a sequel to one of the best games I have played and one that I have finished more than once just to find things i may have missed the first time. Sequels will always be judged more harshly by the fans of the previous installment. Many sequels will never be as good or even greater than the original.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
