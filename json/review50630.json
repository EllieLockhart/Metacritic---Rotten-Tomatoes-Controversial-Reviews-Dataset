Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(4.5\/5)I've sat on my thoughts about The Last Jedi for quite a while. And while I still think I need another screening to properly analyze everything there is to think about\\, I can say with certainty that I loved this film. It dares to be different\\, while keeping in mind everything we loved about Star Wars. It pays homage to what came before it\\, while easing us into the next generation of galactic warriors. Without a doubt\\, the future of the franchise starts here. It's not perfect by any means\\, but there's a lot to like. And everything The Last Jedi does well\\, it does astoundingly so.","true":true}
