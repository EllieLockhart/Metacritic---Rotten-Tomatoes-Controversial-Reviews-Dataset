Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not good\\, it is a complete mess with story arcs being completely useless while others taking completely unsatisfactory. Why kill.off snoke after building so much mystery around him\\, and luke died for basically no reason at all. And reys parents being noone? Makes no sense at all. As a hardcore star wars fan this movie was NOT good.","true":true}
