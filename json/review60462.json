Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I pretty much enjoyed the game; the graphics\\, attention to detail\\, interesting new side characters\\, and delving back into the shoes of Ellie four years after the first game. Like most games\\, this had its flaws. Admittedly\\, I think Joel's death could've been further into the game but what they did with it is fine by me. I think you'd have to know what grief and going through it is actually like to really understand what Ellie was thinking and feeling at the time when she was in Seattle then later on in the ending.Most of the reviews here stating it's s*** were posted only 2hrs after the release of the game. When they saw how and when Joel died\\, they immediately thought the rest of the game is going to be s*** especially when\/if they read the spoilers as well. I think that's unfair since they didn't even give it a chance to begin with. And some of them only watched it on YouTube and didn't actually played it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
