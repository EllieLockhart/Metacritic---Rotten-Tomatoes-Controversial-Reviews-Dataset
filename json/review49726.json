Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"WTF ?!  confused.\\n\\nThis IS NOT StarWars.  \\n\\nthis is a B movie on its own\\, certainly not our beloved\\, it looks like starwars\\, sounds like stawars\\, but this is not starwars\\n\\nDisney successfully killed this franchise with turning it into the avengers in space...couldnt tell if this was starwars 8 or the next installment of guardians of the galaxy.\\nthey also managed to cram enough SJW crap down your throat to effectively make you never want to see another Starwars film again \\, and that's not taking into account the fact that any meaningful character or story arc was killed off leaving us with a bunch of underdeveloped token characters that i don't really care what happens to.   \\n\\nif you are easily amused by shiny things\\, hollow action packed \\, pew pew  explosion and cgi  dazzling spectacles and want to feed disney  for them to continue ruing every film they touch... by all means\\, go and plink down 15$\\nbut if you expect to see a film with any kind of thought  towards  character development\\, creative  story line\\, franchise continuity\\, questions being answered from TFA\\, or really any coherant point to this colossal waste of time i would not recommend it.  blue ray it\\, or better yet pirate that shit and just stream it.  \\n\\nRian Johnson & whoever approved this gawdawful script at Disney just took a massive dump onto the whole StarWars Saga.\\n\\nbut thats just my opinion\\, I was hyped as hell to see it \\, i wish I didnt.\\n9 is out of the question. no more loyalty and money from me Disney. \\nfool me once (TFA) shame on you\\, fool me twice\\, shame on me.]","true":true}
