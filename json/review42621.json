Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was basically trash.  I was a huge Star Wars fan as a kid. Had all the great lines memorized even from the emperor and all that.  Gaping plot holes. The movie insulted my intelligence.  Star Wars is trash now.  Also the critics on this site have to be really questioned why are you rating this so high?  The whole plot was trash.","true":true}
