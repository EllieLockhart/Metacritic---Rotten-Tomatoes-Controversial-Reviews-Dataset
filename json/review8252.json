Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Far and away the best Star Wars period.  A cinematic epic that is beautiful to watch and puts you on the edge of your seat and Keeps you there.  Great central plot that allows characters to develop and be revealed while always centering on the plot. Even deeper and more relevant\\, this is a film that exhibits the leadership\\, wisdom and courage of women in a way that fits within the framework of the movie. Disregard the low fan score which I assume is due to the Vloggers who spent thousands of hours investigating the origins of fictional characters who had yet to be written.  Forgive them for being a little sad that some of their theories were set on their ear :)  They will all line up for the next one like they always do to dress up and complain.  In the interim\\, know that this is an epic adventure.  \\nThe only thing you need to know is that at this point\\, 7 days after opening\\, box office is at 650 Million and growing for The Last Jedi.","true":true}
