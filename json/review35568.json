Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is above all else different. The storyline doesn't follow what a usual star wars film is like and that's why I love it so much. The characters were all developed and used in a brilliant way\\, and Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver gave excellent performances. It is my favourite of all the Star Wars films.","true":true}
