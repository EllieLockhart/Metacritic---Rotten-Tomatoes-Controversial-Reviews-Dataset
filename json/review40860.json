Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie completely subverted everyone's expectations and I think that's why it has been so divisive. Once the dust settles and we have the 3rd movie in the trilogy and can't look at everything in context after seeing the whole story\\, I truly believe this will be remembered as one of the better Star Wars movies.","true":true}
