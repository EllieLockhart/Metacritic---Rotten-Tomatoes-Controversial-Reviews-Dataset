Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Even after watching this movie a second time I just couldn't find any real value in it.  It completely drifted away from what made Star Wars great and it feels like we're being fed a social justice diatribe on screen.  Every villain is a white guy and every hero is a feminist or minority fighting against the 1%.  I get that we should be trying to be inclusive\\, but this was so obviously forced.  It's as if it was written specifically for the Hollywood elite to stroke their own conscience.  I'm not saying we shouldn't cast minorities or women to be the hero's\\, I'm all in favor of that.
