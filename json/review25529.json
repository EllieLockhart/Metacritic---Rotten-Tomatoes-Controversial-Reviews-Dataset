Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"NO SPOILERS ---\\nThe latest SW film is a visual treat\\, full of excitement and world-building. It's surprisingly heavier on personal stories over spectacle\\, but doesn't skimp on spectacle either.\\n\\nThere are a few plot head-scratchers or possible holes and characters we are told to like\\, but not given a reason to\\, but beyond that\\, it's a great movie.","true":true}
