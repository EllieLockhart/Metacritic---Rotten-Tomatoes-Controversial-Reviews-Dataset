Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I heard it was bad\\, but didn't realise it was going to be THIS bad. These bew Star Wars films have absolutely ruined a once loved series. That's enough for me\\, I don't think I'll be watch any other movies.","true":true}
