Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a wasted opportunity for the characters (old and new)\\, story line\\, and future for the saga.  Acting was great\\, just a lousy story.  So sorry this movie is final chapter in the lives of characters that have influenced and inspired people in their real lives for decades.","true":true}
