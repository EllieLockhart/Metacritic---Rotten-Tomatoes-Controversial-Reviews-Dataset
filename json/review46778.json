Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well done to Rian Johnson on The Last Jedi. He brought an interesting and creative vision to this movie which is why it is one of my top SW favorites. Mark Hamill and Adam Driver are extremely talented actors.\\nI plan on watching it again in theaters.\\n\\n(Btw I am a hard core Trump supporter and conservative and I didn't perceive TLJ to have any liberal agenda)","true":true}
