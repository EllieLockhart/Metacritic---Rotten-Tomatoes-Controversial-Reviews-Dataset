Gameplay is very fun the prone and all the dogs really do add a nice layer of tension the combat is very very visceral and I love it almost mortal Kombat level and I absolutely love the dodging mechanic. However if u didn't like previous naughty dog combat systems you not gonna like this one....... probably. To sum it up loved elllie part hated everything else..... Story wise. Game is fun tho give it a try only if you enjoy the GAMEPLAY of the previous game if you are looking for a deep connection between character like Ellie and Joel look elsewhere\u2026 Expand","true":true}
