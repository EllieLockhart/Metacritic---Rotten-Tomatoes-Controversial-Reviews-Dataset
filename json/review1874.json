Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Aside from a collection of visually engaging scenes\\, the movie offers little to recommend.  From character and plot development\/stewardship\\, to dialogue and acting\\, this thing is a careless abomination.  And the ham-handed political messages are as poorly executed as they are inappropriate.  Dern's \\\"strong female leader\\\" shtick was actually more cringingly uncomfortable to watch than Anakin wooing Padme.  Bleh.  Done with SW.... and (to whatever extents possible) done with Disney.","true":true}
