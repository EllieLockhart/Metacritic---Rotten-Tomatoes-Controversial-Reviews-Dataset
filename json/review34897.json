Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film disappoints. It is unable to set a tone\\, ruining any scene intended to be intense\\, exciting\\, or dramatic with quips and jokes; any tension the film begins to build is completely dissipated by them. \\n\\nThe plot feels entirely like a filler. Few of the characters have much to show for an arc\\, and the plot lines are completely without consequence. The dramatic action only exists by contrivance to draw out the same endings threatened from the beginning. \\n\\nSeveral times\\, the film hints that perhaps it will make a bold move as a part of the whole - completely disavow major concepts of expectations and cut away dramatic ties to previous entries. This would have been a bold move\\, if they had followed through. None of the hinted potential big twists or arcs amount to anything\\, and status quo reigns again. To wit - by the end\\, almost everything is effectively the same as it was in the beginning.\\n\\nI praise the design of the combat\\, re-capturing the WWII styles that the original trilogy sported\\, as well as much of the visual design. Character arc questions aside\\, Adam Driver is excellent as Ben\/Kylo\\, and this character remains the most interesting one in the new media. That the film opted to go with its unexpected plot design is worth praise\\, but its execution is exceedingly poor\\, and remains transparent that it takes much of its ideas for particular scenes and tones straight from Empire Strikes Back\\, still lacking in originality. \\n\\nThere are some things worth liking in this movie\\, but they are far outweighed by the awful parts.","true":true}
