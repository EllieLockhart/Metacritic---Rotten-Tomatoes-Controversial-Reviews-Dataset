The clickers\\, the can somehow spot you even if you\u2019re not moving and that can be annoying at times. Let\u2019s talk about the things I like\\, 1. The story\\, it\u2019s starts off kinda boring but once a major event happens it starts to pick up\\, 2. The crafting system\\, while it\u2019s not what I\u2019m used too it still does it\u2019s job\\, 3. The enemies\\, instead of your normal clickers\\, runners\\, and bloaters there\u2019s also shambles and stalkers the two new zombie types are really fun and it adds a bit more of a challenge. In the game you\u2019re introduced to two new factions the WLF (Washington Liberation Front) and the scars\\, the WLF is like the military and can be very challenging at times and the scars they\u2019re not bad I just came across them not too long ago but they were easy to kill. If you\u2019re cautious about buying this game I highly recommend it I've played a lot of games with good stories and this one is the second best. It\u2019s a great game and I think you\u2019ll enjoy spending time with the character (Ellie) that you grew to love in The Last of Us part 1.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
