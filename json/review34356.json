Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The attempts at humor just ruined this film. The other problem was the experts giving this film a 92% on the TM and comparing it to ESB was a huge letdown. I'm wondering if they regret not letting JJ direct the whole series\\, I think so. Anyway I hope Ron Howard saves the day with Solo in a few months.","true":true}
