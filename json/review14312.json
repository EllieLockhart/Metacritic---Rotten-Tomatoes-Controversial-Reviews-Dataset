Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I grew up on the original Star Wars films and I am a huge fan of them. To say I was disappointed in this film is an understatement. I thought the characters were cheesy and shallow\\, the costumes were rubbish and the story was at times boring. I did not enjoy it at all. I'm going to pretend I haven't seen it and the only Star Wars films that exist are the original ones.","true":true}
