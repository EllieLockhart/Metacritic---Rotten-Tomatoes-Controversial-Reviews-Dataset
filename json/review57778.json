Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually impressive and the actors do their best\\, but it's all wasted with the terrible script. Everything from the original trilogy is defiled\\, promising storylines from the \\\"Force Awakens\\\" are discarded\\, beloved characters either emotionlessly killed off or neglected\\, and nothing in the story achieves any kind of payoff. Just pointless scenes one after another\\, covered with inappropriate and unfunny \\\"humour\\\"\\, not to mention terrible dialogue and pacing issues. \\n\\nIt's incomprehensible how this script has passed Disney's management and has gone all the way into production. It's apparent that Kathleen Kennedy is as clueless as Rian Johnson\\, but surely there must be other management personnel besides Kennedy who have to be assured about the script before it ends up in production\\, especially with brand as big as Star Wars. How the hell was this ever approved? \\n\\nMost of all I feel terrible for Mark Hamill\\, who was forced to act Luke the way it was scripted. Like a true professional\\, Hamill pushed a top performance despite the sordid mockery Rian had written for him\\, but clearly it was a painful procedure to depict Luke Skywalker in a way that was thrown at him. And it was painful for us viewers too\\, to watch the character of Luke Skywalker get butchered beyond recognition on the screen. \\n\\nOnly good thing about this movie is that it finally made me create a RT account so I can give this travesty a 1 star rating.","true":true}
