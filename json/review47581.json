Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What the hell happened to Luke ?!?!? How did Leia float through space like that ?!?!?! Why the hell did Kylo kill his mentor snoke ? Cause he had a little sith crush on Rey who did next to nothing in the movie except move some rocks Why did this get a critic score above 90. WTF is really going on","true":true}
