Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is exciting\\, unexpected\\, thrilling\\, and rewrites the rulebook in  a way that will energise the series but might take some adjusting for fans who live by those rules.\\n\\nThere are storylines that have no impact on the film at all\\, but all remains fun.","true":true}
