Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love Star Wars. I thought Force Awakens was decent but not without its flaws. Rian Johnson's f@&k up falls in the ranks of Phantom Menace. Plot holes\\, terrible casting\\, ridiculous comical chase scenes - Rian splooges this crap all over the screen as some sort of ploy to portray it as progressive. Magic of Star Wars is dead now.
