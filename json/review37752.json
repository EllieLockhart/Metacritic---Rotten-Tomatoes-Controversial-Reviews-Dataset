Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There was some good stuff\\, but it just looks wrong\\, is too rushed\\, many parts (Leia floating\\, Canto casino) are stupid\\, too rushed\\, no time to get settled anywhere\\, really be acclimatized with the universe\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,khlwenlkfn;sln\\nthere was some good stuff.
