Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Every opportunity they have to do something really cool in this film is squandered.  Screen time that could have been used for Kylo vs Luke is dedicated to porgs and other dopey slapstick bits.  Characters advance in no meaningful way.  All returning storylines are basically reset for some reason.  What were they thinking with this?  Episode 9 better come out and immediately say \\\"that was all just a dream\\\"\\, because Last Jedi is a nightmare for any longtime fan.","true":true}
