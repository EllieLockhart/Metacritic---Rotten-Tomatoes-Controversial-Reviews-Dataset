Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Full of many amazing moments\\, visually stunning effects\\, and amazing performances from all the actors.  Unfortunately\\, I felt that the plot was lacking by the end and many questions raised by TFA were answered in boring or unsatisfying ways.  It's unfortunate what they've done to Luke's character\\, and Disney continues to insist on putting Rey at the same level as Kylo Ren when he's had years more training than her.  Interesting that the movie continuously puts so much emphasis on needing a master when there's no less than THREE characters using force abilities without much or any formal training whatsoever.  The reveal of Rey's parents wasn't executed well\\, the way they handled Snoke wasn't executed well\\, the entire casino sequence was unnecessary\\, and Phasma was wasted yet again.  Luke's character arc wasn't handled well\\, but his touching reunions with past characters were truly marvelous.  Overall\\, not a bad movie at all\\, but very Disney\\, and not very Star Wars.","true":true}
