Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'd like to preface this by saying I enjoyed TFA. The Last Jedi was a huge slap in the face. Rian eviscerated Luke Skywalker. I now understand why Mark Hamill made the comment that he fundamentally disagreed with Rian Johnson portrayal of Luke. I agree with Mark. The numerous plot holes also and terrible writing decisions have pretty much sealed the deal for me. I'm in agreement with my wife that our family (3 kids) will not be involved in this franchise any longer. #RianRuinedSW","true":true}
