Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was something unique and it wasnt like any other star wars movie and I enjoyed every second of it. A lil long at times ran slow to fast but the movie was very good. No spoilers but I think a couple fans are just salty hence this low audience rating lol. 9.5\/10","true":true}
