Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not sure I will ever be able to trust \\\"critics\\\" again. This movie was terrible. Not only did it dismantle and trash the entire star wars franchise\\, but it did so in an entirely incoherent and unsophisticated plot. If you haven't seen this movie yet\\, please don't. The \\\"last hope\\\" for any true star wars fan is for Disney to get the message and correct course for the future.","true":true}
