Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star wars: The last jedi takes up a different road\\, unexpected for a star wars\/blockbuster movie. Rian's vision of Luke\\, the plot twists and new ways to use the Force are spectacularly filmed\\, casting new light in the space opera mithology.","true":true}
