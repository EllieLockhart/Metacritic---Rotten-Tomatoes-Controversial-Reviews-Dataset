Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke Skywalker was my hero growing up. I waited 34 years to see him return. This was not the Luke Skywalker that I recognized or hoped to see. The character deserved better\\, and Mark Hamill definitely deserved better. His fate made no sense and was unnecessary\\, unless the goal was to eliminate all the old characters so Disney can make more money with new\\, younger characters.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis movie was mostly about Luke\\, Leia\\, Rey\\, and Kylo. Everyone else was given nonsensical plot busywork to justify their presence. Nothing made sense\\, nor did it ultimately matter in the end. Just a waste of an amazing cast and special effects\\, which were the only highlights of this movie.\\n\\nUltimately\\, the director wanted to surprise us by zigging when we thought he would zag. And to an extent that can be fun. But there was just too much of it. Rey's parents? Nope. Snope? Nope. Kylo turning? Nope. Rey turning? Nope. Poe drama? Nope. Leia dying? Nope. Kylo killing her? Nope. Finn dying? Nope. Luke fighting Kylo? Nope. Leia not realizing that a hologram just handed her a hologram? Nope. Luke not randomly dying because reasons? Nope. At some point\\, you can only have the rug pulled out from under you so many time that you no longer want to get up anymore. I'll just stay here on the floor and pretend I never saw this movie.","true":true}
