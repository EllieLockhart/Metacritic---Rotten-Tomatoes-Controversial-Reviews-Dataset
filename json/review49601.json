Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow so many surprises and interesting character choices. A lot of twists so don\u2019t read any spoilers. I think it might be my favorite after Empire but it\u2019ll take a few more viewings to be sure. This movie takes Star Wars to new places. After seven saga films and one stand alone film it\u2019s nice to see we can still be taken to new places in this franchise. ","true":true}
