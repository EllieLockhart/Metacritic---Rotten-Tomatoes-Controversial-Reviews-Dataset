Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The more and more you think about this movie the less you will like it...  Sub-plots that should be taken out completely\\, Snoke is pointless\\, a good guy general that was worthless all but two seconds\\,  Both Skywalker's were just sad\\, Luke a coward??? come on....  Leia almost on her death bed not forcing her student\\, she has groomed to take her place\\, to go on the ships and survive.  Military tactics that a four year old gamer could have come up with better options.  Acting was great I can say but good god the movie isn't very good if you put any thought into it.  Oh and ROSE??? what a joke....   I always recommend people going to see movies to decide for themselves but I would serious wait and rent this movie for two dollars at a RedBox.","true":true}
