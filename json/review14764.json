Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have quite a bit to say but it\u2019s useless to throw it all up into a review that may or not be read about someone who actually cares - but I can most certainly say with confidence - there wouldn\u2019t be a Star Wars series if it started out with a movie like this.. Lack of character building - check Substantial lack of plot - check More time spent on cheesy one liners than quality light saber battles and Jedi training - check Multiple time in the theater where people say out loud \u201cwhat just happened\\, why - huhhh?!\u201d - check Losing grip on a Star Wars fan - check","true":true}
