Review bombing is a thing unfortunately. Yes there are plotholes\\, pacing is messy\\, too much political crap. Still a lot better story than 99% of the games on the market. Gameplay is similar to the 1st game but the level design and fluidity of animations make it a much better experience. I would give it a 7\\, rated 10 here becauae the hatred of the disappointed whines is too much\\, tryin to balance it out.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
