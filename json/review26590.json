Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Oh\\, where to start... \\n\\nThe movie tried to hard to be funny. I can appreciate a few funny parts here and there\\, but got to the point where it felt like I was watching Kylo Ren's \\\"Undercover Boss\\\" spoof on SNL.\\n\\nTried to hard to be unpredictable.The killing of Snoke\\, Rey's background\\, Phasma's anti-climatic demise\\, ect. I get why you'd want to keep the fans guessing and wondering what's going to happen next but this movie tried throwing us through so many loops it left us with more questions than answers and more disappointments than happy surprises. There's point where you don't have to be too obliging to fan theories and being a chaotic mess that it was\\, the film failed to find that happy medium\\n\\nThe main protagonist Rey\\, played by Daisy Ridley\\, is well deserving of the title: Mary Sue. (A character who is unexplainably good at anything put in front of her) From flying the Millennium Falcon to mind tricking the Storm Trooper to lifting rocks and besting the main antagonist Kylo Ren and Luke Skywalker with a light sabre despite having no training. If there's no challenge or hardship for the protagonist to struggle and overcome... It makes them uninteresting\\n\\nA few of the plots made no sense\\, like the in-fighting in the Resistance. The attempted mutiny was unnesessary and forced.\\n\\nLeia's Mary Poppins in space was the dumbest thing I've ever seen. That includes movies that attempt to be dumb for a humorous climax. I was tempted to leave the theater.\\n\\nUninteresting characters: Rose\\, Finn\\, Holdo\\, Hux\\, DJ\\, even Kylo","true":true}
