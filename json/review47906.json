Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While having a few\\, scarece moments of wonder\\, overall this film most likely may be the worst Star Wars film of all.  Filled with expectation that fails to satisfy on so many levels\\, this film provides the most two-dimensional characters since The Phantom Menace. Soooo disappointed.","true":true}
