Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars is as dead as a dodo. Lucas took some \\\"creative liberties\\\" stretching his saga to 6 episodes. Now Disney is simply driving Star Wars into the ground. No story arc\\, therefore the film sucks. JJ has a lot to blame\\, and Kathleen Kennedy for hiring him. What a balls up!","true":true}
