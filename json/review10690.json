Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had some interesting scenes\\, I enjoyed daisy and Kylo's development \\, however I found the humor \\\"forced\\\" and hit and miss\\, the story long and underwhelming and the conclusion just left me tired and uninterested in seeing episode 9.","true":true}
