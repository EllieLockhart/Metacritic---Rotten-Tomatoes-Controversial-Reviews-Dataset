Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very well done\\, those saying Skywalker was treated with respect are so far off\\, he is the savior of the Jedi and Yoda had to guide him once again to become what Yoda became for Luke.  The new order has begun and Rei will grow the rising group! Great job and story!","true":true}
