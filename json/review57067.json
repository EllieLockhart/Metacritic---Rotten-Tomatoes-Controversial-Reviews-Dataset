Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was a Disney movie\\, not a star wars movie. Leaves so many plotholes\\, the writing is so incredibly lazy. Fun to watch\\, but not if you care about the overarching trilogy story","true":true}
