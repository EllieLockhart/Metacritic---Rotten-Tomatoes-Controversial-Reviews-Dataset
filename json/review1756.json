Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a Star Wars fan I liked every movie until now\\, Luke is a beloved character and you ruined him. Toy made him seem like a physco and a coward in the end by the way you use the hologram b.s. instead of letting him be a legit bad A. You wasted so many characters and killed all our expectations for the future. We have the weakest villain of the entire saga who has already been beaten in the Force Awakens","true":true}
