Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A bold new approach to expand the Star Wars Universe.  Visually stunning.  Loved the pacing\\, fighting\\, and performances by Mark Hamill and Adam Driver\\, in particular.  \\nNot crazy about a particular solution to Carrie Fisher's passing\\, but I can overlook that\\, it did not affect my feelings for the film overall.\\nAlso last 2 minutes or so\\, a little schmaltzy.  \\nLooking forward to how the ending plays into Star Wars IX.","true":true}
