Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First off\\, huge fan of the series and was looking forward to all the answers I would get from this that the force awakens left us with. This movie though was atrocious... I've been so bummed with what they did. No questions were answered\\, I feel like I was trolled by Disney\\, and everyone I talked with felt the same. There were so many plot holes that I really can't fathom what any of the creators were thinking. I could have written a better thought out story in one evening and a couple drinks... Just really sad with what they have done... Sadly I don't see any way for them to redeem this","true":true}
