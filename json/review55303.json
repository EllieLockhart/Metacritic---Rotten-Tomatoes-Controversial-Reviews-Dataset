Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Let the past die. Kill it if you have to.\\\" The most integral line of The Last Jedi\\, spoken by Kylo Ren\\, is an extremely loaded sentiment. It refers to many things. Firstly\\, the characters letting go of their desires and their demons. Secondly\\, it is asking the audience to let go of their preconceived notions of what Star War is\\, and everything tied to the nostalgia of the original trilogy. Thirdly\\, and most surprisingly of all\\, it also asks the audience to let go of what they think is going to happen and any narrative they've created in their head. The Last Jedi\\, for better and for worse\\, is a middle finger to fans. And as such\\, it will ultimately prove to be the most divisive film in the entire franchise.\\n\\nThere is a lot to love about The Last Jedi. It has some of the most captivating moments in any Star Wars film\\, and there will be several instances in which you feel unable to breath\\, jaw on the floor. The stakes\\, at all times\\, feel incredibly high as director Rian Johnson continually shifts the tension. As we neared the climax\\, I really thought any character was fair game to be taken off of the board. That being said\\, whilst the film boldly veers in a direction that very few fans will see coming\\, it doesn't fully commit and ultimately fails to stick the landing. \\n\\nWhilst raising questions of the importance of the Force\\, and whether the Jedi deserve to even stick around after causing so much conflict\\, the narrative seems to come together rather simply. The characters have been fleshed out in interesting ways that talking about them individually makes for riveting discussion\\, but when you fit the puzzle together the image isn't quite clear. It's almost as if a handful of the pieces are in the wrong place\\, and if they were just shuffled around or swapped out we'd have a pitch perfect film that fearlessly reinvents by also satisfies a larger spectrum of viewers. \\n\\nMost importantly\\, The Last Jedi is truly a film that needs to be experienced with as little influence from others as possible. I am still sitting here going back and forth on ideas a full 24 hours later\\, and that's all that's been on my mind. If nothing else\\, The Last Jedi will have viewers locked in discussion for weeks if not months. It requires serious marination after an initial viewing\\, and definitely should be seen multiple times if you want to cement your feelings. Is The Last Jedi worth seeing? Absolutely. But that doesn't mean you're going to like it.","true":true}
