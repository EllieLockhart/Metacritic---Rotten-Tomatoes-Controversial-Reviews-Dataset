Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Enormous disappointment.\\n\\nThe writing is terrible\\, full of plotholes\\, inconsistencies and contradictions to TFA and other canonical material (novels\\, comic books)\\, the movie is overall too long and terribly paced\\, the humour is silly and juvenile\\, characters behave illogically just so the plot can move Forward\\, not because it makes sense...\\n\\nAs a fan of Finn\\, Rey and Poe in particular I am also disappointed by their treatment: Rey\\, who was supposed to be a role model for little girls\\,  becomes an passive pawn in the conflict between two men she isn't even related to\\, Finn\\, whose unique past as a kidnapped\\, brainawshed child soldier who escaped would have offered such potential for interesting storylines\\, is shoved into an unispired and pointless B plot\\, and previously competent and likable Poe is suddenly turned into an arrogant and reckless misogynist. \\n\\nThat's not how feminism and diversity work\\, Disney!","true":true}
