Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Trying too hard to be a Marvel film with little respect paid to original films and characters. It was pretty much downhill after the \u201ccan you hear me now\u201d joke in the first scene. That said\\, my 11-year-old loved it\\, so maybe Disney isn\u2019t making this for me anyway. Humbug!","true":true}
