Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Registered only to give 1 star. Terrible movie in overall. Kills everything that  became interesting from Force Awakens. Who is Snoke? We still have no idea\\, but he's as lame as one can be\\, we learnt. The mystery in Rey is just ruined with some very primitive jokes and a very lame explanation about her parents. Luke... what the hell happened to him? A Jedi master having no idea about anything any time. Terrible writing\\, confusing characters. Even Carrie Fisher's acting resembles a soap opera at times.","true":true}
