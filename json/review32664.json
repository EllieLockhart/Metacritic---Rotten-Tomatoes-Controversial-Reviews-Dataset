Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi is one of the best movies I have seen this year. The action is simply amazing and the story of Rey Luke and Kylo is one of the best character arcs in the history of the series. Rian Johnson and Lucas film dare to do things that have never been done in a star wars movie before. I can see where and why this movie is dividing the fans so heavily as it departs from everything seen on screen before. there were some problems as movie is ever perfect. the casino and Finn\/Rose plot was pretty unnecessary to the overall picture but I did like Rose as a character and hope she is back for the next one as well. The opening battle sequence and final battle are two of the best shot sequences ever in star wars. also I love the choice of killing off Snoke. we've seen his evil bad sith like character dozens of times in star wars. having Kylo the main bad guy is going to add so much to the final film.
