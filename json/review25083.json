Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nearly the worst SW movie ever. Rain Johnson tries so hard to make it the absolute worst but came up jusg shy. The movie is horrible. It's a complete copy of SW 4 and 5 condensed into 1 film. Please stop trying to bring politics into this\\, I loved Rogue One\\, thought it was original\\, uniques\\, compelling\\, and artistic. This\\, this was none of those. It tried to force humor way too many times to count\\, it butchered the legacy of Luke\\, it introduces characters that quite frankly have no meaning or relevance; no backstory or character development. It goes no where in the timeline of SW\\, lacks character development development\\, and leaves gaping plot holes the size of a black hole. Quite simply this movie sucks. Unlike other films\\, like SWE3 which I watched in theater 13 times\\, I watched this once\\, and decided to go see an actually good movie multiple times in theater called Jumanji\\, that has originality\\, spontaneity\\, and timely well used comedy. Oh and did I mention Jumanjin has been beating SW at the box office since New Years?","true":true}
