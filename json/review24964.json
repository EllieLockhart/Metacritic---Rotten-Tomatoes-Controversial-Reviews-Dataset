Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My kid (who loves Star Wars) wanted to leave half way through this film.  The plot was obscure\\, the humor lame and the new characters did not really add to this film at all.  Leia's Mary Poppins moment was just awful.  It should have been a great film\\, not this mess.","true":true}
