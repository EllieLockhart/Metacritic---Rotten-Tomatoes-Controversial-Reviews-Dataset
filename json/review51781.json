Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Admittedly\\, I went into the theater with high expectations\\, but what I saw was surprisingly awful. This film failed on every opportunity to deliver on the story set up by The Force Awakens\\, displaying what I can only describe as contempt for its predecessor. From Rey's parents\\, to Snoke's origins\\, there was no attempt made to answer the looming questions in any semblance of a satisfying way. Each moment was casually dismissed as though they didn't matter. This film was too concerned with making statements and subverting fan expectations\\, that it forgets to do anything interesting to progress the story.\\n\\nTLJ had the opportunity to send off Luke Skywalker in style\\, but instead he is painted as a corward who ultimately does very little and dies of exhaustion. A weak effort that didn't come close to doing a legendary character justice - very disappointing.\\n\\nEven the new characters aren't allowed to grow or develop\\, they are just kind of...there. Except BB8\\, he's a superhero now. \\n\\nThe biggest fault I have with this movie is that it gives the audience nothing to look forward to in future installments. The film ends and there isn't any momentum or excitement for what might come next. It feels more like a conclusion\\, rather than a middle chapter\\, but nothing has been accomplished except for killing key characters from the original trilogy and leaving the story in shambles moving forward.","true":true}
