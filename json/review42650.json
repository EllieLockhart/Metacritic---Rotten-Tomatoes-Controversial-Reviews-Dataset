Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was did so much damage to the franchise it's crazy. People overwhelmingly hated this garbage of a movie. Don't believe me? Just look at Last Jedi merchandise sales. They are almost nothing. Kids aren't even buying the toys. It makes sense though. This movie was so poorly written and directed. Star Wars lost a lot of fans thanks to Disney.","true":true}
