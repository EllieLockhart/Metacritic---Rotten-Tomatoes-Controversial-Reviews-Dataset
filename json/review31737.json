Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So the one guy who the entire legend of Star Wars revolves around is a fearful\\, cowardly\\, selfish\\, recluse whose only display of force talent is creating old holograms of himself so he doesn't have to face a problem head-on\\, as would a real hero? I'm just not buying Luke's character; clearly the writers had no interest is understanding the Star Wars Story. So what if Luke lost a nephew and a few students. Han and Leia lost a son; Yoda lost the entire Jedi order under his watch\\, but no body ended up like Luke. And speaking of Leia\\, she fearlessly commands what's last of the resistance; blows doors off the hinges with the force; and floats through space in a bubble. Just...wow...... It's like every woman in the movie is immaculate and every guy is a mentally fragile\\, hot head\\, humor-laden\\, thieving lowlife\\, or just plain evil. The only evil woman is Captain Phasma\\, who is portrayed as an armor-clad sentinel type\\, without a visible shred of femininity. I don't know if this clear distinction was intentional or not\\, but who cares...  Thanks\\, but no thanks. \\nMy grade: D-    Bad movie made by Hollywood execs who care less about the art and more about the return on investment. So disrespectful to the Lucas legacy and the Skywalker story line. As far as I'm concern episodes 1-6 are the only real Star Wars movies.","true":true}
