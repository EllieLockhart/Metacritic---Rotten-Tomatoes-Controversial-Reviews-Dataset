Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely cannot stand this film. Rian Johnson is a buffoon\\, who\\, in the pursuit of his own egotistical and psychotic behavior\\, has created a downright unwatchable film. None of the character threads are fleshed out - Finn is still a joke\\, Rey undergoes no struggle and thus is an incredibly flat character\\, and Poe is not any better. I won't even begin on the stupidity of creating a walking talking political manifesto and calling them a character\\, i.e. Rose. Kylo Ren is a perfect allegory for any angsty teenager\\, not that any \\\"intimidating\\\" villain should act as such. The character assassination of Luke Skywalker has been covered more than enough\\, but it still warrants mentioning. I ask any person who appreciated The Last Jedi to give a reason as for Luke Skywalker to go from redeeming the most evil man in the galaxy (Darth Vader) to attempting to murder his nephew before he even does anything. Holdo is another joke\\, similar to Finn\\, though she represents all which is wrong with Lucasfilm on the political front\\, that is\\, they have their heads in the sand and force identity politics into everything\\, including Admiral \\\"Gender Studies.\\\" This film is terrible\\, and I'm sick of Lucasfilm's attitude towards the now former fans for disliking The Last Jedi. But I guess that I'm just another manbaby\\, right?","true":true}
