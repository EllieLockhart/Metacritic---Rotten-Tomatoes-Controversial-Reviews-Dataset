Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had to force myself to enjoy a lot of strange plot moments\\, This is not Star Wars at all\\, at least the fights were cool? Disney is doing a lot of work to rewrite how the force works and who can use it so they can appeal to the kiddos. \\n\\nI also don't know why they would write Luke how they did\\, too out of character for me...the Luke I saw growing up would never act or do what this one does.","true":true}
