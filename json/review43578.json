Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was my last Star Wars film - it sucked so badly that I fell asleep about 30 minutes into it. I didn't want to wake up it was so horrid\\, but my wife nudged me and said; you're sleeping. I said; put me to sleep\\, this is a disaster.","true":true}
