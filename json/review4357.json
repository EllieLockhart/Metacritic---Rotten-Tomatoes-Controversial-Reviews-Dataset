Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Canto Bite is only 10min of screen time people. It's not the entire 2nd act as some nutto's make it out to be. Luke was Luke and as pessimistic as he always was. It's not awful. It isn't spectacular. It does some funny things and it does some overly serious things making it laughable. It's like the annoyance of the Furbies toys with a dash of the past films thrown in.","true":true}
