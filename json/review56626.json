Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"The Last Jedi\\\" is the worst Star Wars movie ever made. After lackluster initial reactions\\, I decided not to see it in the theaters\\, and waited for its Amazon release. I am glad I did\\, and still feel I wasted my money. \\nThe movie was poorly edited\\, and its attempt to be \\\"cutsie\\\" with the Porg failed miserably. There was only one scene with the Porg that actually benefited the movie; the rest looked as if someone cut in \\\"Happy Feet\\\" footage as a joke. The Porg detracted from the drama of the other scenes they were in. \\nThe entire Finn\/Rose adventure contributed nothing to the movie\\, and was ruined with what seemed to be a Social Justice Punch List of issues they just had to address. \\nRey's character\\, who I thought might be interesting after \\\"Force Awakens\\\"\\,  became incredibly one dimensional. She is made to look invulnerable\\, incapable of failure\\, and loaded with unearned ability at everything she does. The movie missed every opportunity to actually make her interesting. The only reason I gave the movie a 1-1\/2 star rating was the VFX were a bit above average\\, and John Williams' score did not disappoint. \\nDisney may as well not make an \\\"Episode IX\\\". Star Wars is dead. The First Order has captuered the last Resistance Base\\, the Resistance is on the run\\, reduced to one shipload that the rest of the galaxy doesn't give a damn about\\, and they killed Luke Skywalker\\, who died without an heir. Here ends Star Wars. There is nothing left to bring back.  There is no character left in the Star Wars universe that I care enough about to pay to see another Star Wars movie.","true":true}
