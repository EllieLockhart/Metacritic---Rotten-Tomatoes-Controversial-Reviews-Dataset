Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not star wars. Disney does a terrible job at thing to replicate George lucas' work. The film start strong but leaves a bad taste in your mouth so to say. What fans want us to see light saber action a war but this was more of a Star Chase not star wars to call it star wars is an insult to the world of George Lucas even Mark Hamill Dissagrees with how this film was put together. It was rushed out with no thought of how to direct it. Disney has ruined star wars.","true":true}
