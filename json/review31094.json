{"101487":167958,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-23","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So\\, I  watched the Last Jedi in IMAX 3D over the weekend\\, and here are my thoughts\\, there will be spoilers below\\n\\nSpoilers \\n\\nSpoilers\\n\\nSeriously!! Spoilers!!!\\n\\nTo start off\\, I have to say that the movie is cinematically beautiful. Its probably the most elegantly photographed Star Wars movie I have seen\\, and to that end\\, it didn't really quite have the feel of a Star Wars movie... not sure if that is a plus or minus. Additionally\\, Its very entertaining\\, and a lot of fun if you don't think about the plot holes too much while watching\\, so even if you don't LOVE Star Wars like I do\\, its still a good time. \\n\\nBut now the criticisms....\\n\\nSeriously\\, here come the spoilers. \\n\\nThe premise is stupid. The rebels\/resistance whatever they call themselves these days is basically on three ships. They jump to light speed but the First Order has hyperspace tracking (See Rogue One) which means that the First Order knows exactly where the resistance ships went\\, and when they get there\\, wherever there is\\, its becomes a really long chase sequence where the resistance ships are each running out gas and being overtaken and destroyed by the first order... \\n\\nA) They have laser swords and can travel faster than light speed but they don't have enough fuel to fly for more than a few hours? Seriously? \\n\\nB ) Why doesn't the First Order just tell a handful of their Star Destroyers to jump to hyperspace and overtake the rebels to get in front of them\\, boxing them in from all sides? Nah... lets just slowly follow them until they run out of gas... I'm sorry but thats just stupid. \\n\\nTwo\\, while this whole really slow chase scene is unfolding\\, Fin and his new love interest (Sorry Rey\\, Fin's in demand) have time to fly to a Galaxy Far Far Away's version of Monaco\\, get arrested\\, escape\\, ride space camels\\, fly back to the really slow chase with Fenster from the Usual Suspects to break into the First Order's ship\\, and of course Fenster double crosses them.. .he is Fenster. \\n\\nThree: Why do they think its okay not to tell us anything about back story... there is no development of anything. We know nothing more about who is Rey\\, we aren't told anything about where Snoke came from\\, how he became the leader of the First Order\\, why does the First Order try so hard to look like the Empire with the same style ships and uniforms. What happened to Luke's other padawans? Why does yoda show up? No obi-wan force ghost? No Anakin Skywalker force ghost? Since when does Leia know how to use the force\\, and why would that make her able to survive in the vacuum of space? \\n\\nStar Wars movies in the past are usually bigger\\, the galaxy is bigger\\, they explore more\\, there is more going on... in this movie\\, space felt very small\\, the resistance is minuscule\\, and the it just didn't feel grand\\, and the chase sequence which encompasses 85% of the move feels like it's in a small nook in space. \\n\\nOn the good: \\n\\nI like an old\\, broken Luke Skywalker who is sick of everything and wants to be left alone. His nephew has decided to become a real douche\\, and is using his training to do douchey things. \\n\\nAdam Driver's Kylo Ren is the best character in the entire movie. I like that he decided to let go of the Vader festish. \\n\\nI really like all the characters... I like Poe\\, he is like the Han Solo of this Trilogy\\, Fin is very entertaining\\, he is the comic relief and has very touching moments as well. I like how tough Leia is\\, and that lady from the first Jurassic Park was unexpectedly badass. \\n\\nIf I had to grade it\\, I would give this movie a C+ even though I felt like I enjoyed it more immediately after watching it. Upon reflection\\, it really wasn't very well written\\, but was so beautifully shot that it clouds your first impressions until you have time to reflect. I am hoping that J.J. Abrams can right the ship and make a more compelling closing chapter.","true":true}
