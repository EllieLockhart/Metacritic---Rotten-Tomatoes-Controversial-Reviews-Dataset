Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"J.J. Abrams gave Star Wars to Rian Johnson like Rey gave Luke the lightsaber and just like in the the movie when Luck thows away the lightsaber - Rian Johnson throws away Star Wars like garbage! Rian J has to be the worst story teller ever! How did this get aproved? Ryan Jonson seams to have no respect or understanding for the Star Wars univers! I feel so bad for JJ Abram! He must be in panic mode now for the upcoming episode IX!","true":true}
