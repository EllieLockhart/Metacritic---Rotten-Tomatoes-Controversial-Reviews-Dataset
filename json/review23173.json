Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it. Found it to be entertaining and liked the juxtapositions as well as the conflicts within the individuals.  Felt the most \\\"human\\\" of the Saga.  I understand why many are unhappy with the deviation\\, but I thought it was fantastic.  The only thing I was disappointed in really was the lack of tribute to Carrie Fisher (perhaps it was later in the credits than I could stay);  I think a simple acknowledgment and farewell could have provided closure for fans.","true":true}
