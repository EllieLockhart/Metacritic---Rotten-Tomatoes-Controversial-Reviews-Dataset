{"101487":169649,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star rating is a protest to balance the inflated critic ripeness. Fan since '77\\, and I really wanted E8 to be great\\, but I had to painfully fight my fan bias and see it honestly. Unlike E7\\, it felt more akin to the prequels than to the original trilogy.\\n\\nWithout spoiling it\\, great effects\\, action\\, music\\, set pieces\\, creatures\\, but I'm looking more at storytelling credibility\\, arc\\, beats\\, and escapism vs. sociopolitical commentary. There were a lot of things in there that just took me out of the moment and demanded too much to be believable. \\n\\nMany of the twists and surprises didn't feel like credible fantasy but just flying by the seat of his pants and half baked. Rey's origin? Snoke's backstory? The tipped hat to the older generation felt obligatory and somewhat forced\\, and was not as moving nor affecting\\, because it wasn't believable. And Canto Bight kinda bites - detour into a different cinematic universe; that and other moments did not really feel like SWU. With spoilers\\, a lot more could be said\\, e.g. inserting \\\"pageturners\\\" into the lexicon - like that character was about to whip out a cup of Starbucks and copy of the NYTimes.\\n\\nIf I turn off my brain and just go for an action ride\\, 9 stars. But there were just too many conveniences\\, too much luck shoved at us\\, too much fuzzy logic\\, too many pauses to have a deep moment while the world's burning down around them\\, and to me the social commentary was too thinly veiled - again\\, felt more like a prequel than OT. A key ethos of the SWU is classical escapism with the commentary more buried. This bordered on partisan political puff.\\n\\nGreat production values\\, but please bring back someone like Larry for the script. Rian pretty much tied off or trashed the threads he and JJ opened in E7\\, which IMHO\\, even if it was highly derivative of E4's story beats\\, was still a comparatively better told story overall.\\n\\nI'm surprised Kathy's giving Rian a whole other trilogy. Looper was a better film. If so\\, I vote to make it 'anthology' rather than 'canon.' E8 was a wasted opportunity on multiple levels.\\n\\nFunny\\, RT used to be indie\\, but now they're owned by a ticket-selling site and big corporate media company. This title's ripeness looks like a case of skewing critic reviews ripe to boost sales\\, which would be a conflict of interests. RT's credibility is spoiling.","true":true}
