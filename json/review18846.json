Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's an excellent science fiction film\\, but a subpar Star Wars film. Much of the imagination and \\\"fun\\\" from Star Wars has been replaced by stock science fiction tropes. While many of the new characters\\, such as Kylo Ren\\, are fun to see in action\\, it comes at the cost of destroying older beloved characters.","true":true}
