Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the story line was dumb and unrealistic... kill all the major bad guys and most of the rebel.. the story has no where to go. very disappointing sub par movie doesnt even rate a half star","true":true}
