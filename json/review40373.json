Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"THIS IS STARWARS\\n\\n\\nPossibly the best Star Wars movie yet. With amazing characters and an even better plot\\, Rian Johnson outdid himself with this movie. From the flight scene in the beginning\\, to the death of Luke Skywalker\\, this movie is stand alone excellence\\, yet still mirrors all three movies from the original. This movie is too amazing for those who criticize it to truly understand what it means to be a fan of the greatest franchise in the galaxy. Can not wait for Solo or Episode IX","true":true}
