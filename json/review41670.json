Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is just terrible movie making.  Regardless of what you think of any of the character decisions\\, plot holes\\, and dialogue\\, this is simply a badly written\\, badly edited movie.  I've never been honestly bored by a Star Wars movie before\\, but this crew managed it.  So many pointless scenes and undercutting of inherent drama when they do hit on a good moment.  I hope these writers never work again.  Disney needs to take a hard look at how they are handling the franchise.  Golden geese have limits\\, no matter how big they are.  Don't treat Star Wars like Transformers.","true":true}
