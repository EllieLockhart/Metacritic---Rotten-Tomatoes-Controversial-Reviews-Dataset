Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I made an account just so I could leave a negative review on this shit stain of a film. Disney has to be paying these critics to write positive reviews\\, otherwise I must have seen a completely different film. Not only was The Last Jedi pandering\\, it was full of unneeded and awful comedic relief\\, stupid plot holes and plot devices\\, but it also threw all of the set up from the first movie in this trilogy right into the garbage in this vapid\\, cringey\\, and downright boring film. Halfway through\\, I was so put off by how awful this movie was that I just started falling asleep. I feel cheated of my money and I hope Disney knows that this movie is alienating so many fans of the original films. One of the worst movies to come out in 2017 by far. I haven't been this enraged over a film in a long time. Don't waste your money on this train wreck.","true":true}
