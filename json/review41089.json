Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had it's problems\\, but at it's core\\, it was what it was suppose to be... a Star Wars film. I loved every moment\\, even the weirdly paced or out of place bits. I loved Luke\\, I LOVED Kylo\\, I loved Leia\\, I loved Poe\\, I even loved Rose. \\n\\nThe people giving this a low score obviously only want a needless giant battle scene. They don't seem to understand character development\\, they don't seem to understand the message. Was Luke a bit weird? Yes. But we all saw Yoda towards the end of his life. He wasn't exactly the wise and calm person he was in his early years. We can't expect this man who has been through so much\\, who has been living ALONE to be 'normal' can we?\\n\\nI have a lot more I wanna say but honestly\\, I think this movie should be given more of a chance then it is.","true":true}
