Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not as bad as many are saying\\, nor as good. It's a fun 2.4 hour distraction\\, but has many writing and characterization issues. It's almost like Rian Johnson ignored TFA (and much of Star Wars lore) and just did what the wanted to do. Some of it works...some of it sits sour with many fans (Luke's entire characterization\\, pointless Rose on their pointless mission\\, space Leia\\, etc). Still more fun to watch than much of the stuff tossed into theaters these days.","true":true}
