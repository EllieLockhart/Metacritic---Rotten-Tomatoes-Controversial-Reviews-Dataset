Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Simply my favourite most rewarding Star Wars episode and I grew up with Star Wars. I saw A New Hope when I was 12. Many surprises in this movie (I saw the first showing after 3 hours sleep and didn't miss one second). This chapter prepares us for the exciting future ahead. I don't get how fans are slamming the storyline. I see Rian Johnson as a genius with an expendable vision of the future of the franchise.","true":true}
