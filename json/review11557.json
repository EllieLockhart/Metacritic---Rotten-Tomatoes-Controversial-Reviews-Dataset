Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible. So disappointed in this movie. Rian Johnson destroyed the Star Wars we all loved. He should be banned from directing. Horrible\\, horrible\\, horrible. George Lucas must be in his safe room cussing his head off over what I just saw. OMG. How can you deliberately destroy a franchise like that.","true":true}
