Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the biggest piece of SJW driven garbage in a long time. Technically\\, it looks nice but the movie plot and choices taken are a complete insult to the series and I can't believe even worse than TFA.","true":true}
