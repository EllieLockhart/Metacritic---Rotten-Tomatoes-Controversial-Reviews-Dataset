Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had tickets to see this on Sunday\\, and thanks to the brave heroes\\, the common Star Wars fans that saw this before me\\, I was saved the agonizing 2 and a half hours of this turd pile. You all have my thanks\\, now I can use that money to go see a better movie!","true":true}
