Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars movie in the entire franchise. Sadly this is the headline I must give this terrible excuse for a Star Wars movie. I\u2019m a lifelong Star Wars fan but The Last Jedi made me shed tears of indignation because it was so disappointing. Some may be thinking that the prequels were worse\\, however the prequels actually had a plot and story that were somewhat coherent. Episodes 1 and 2 were more for children and was meant to be more on the humor side\\, in order to give Vader a proper introduction. Nearly every scene in the TLJ had serious flaws\\, plot holes\\, plot armor\\, and continuity issues. The jokes in the movies were completely out of place and drastically took away from the more serious scenes. The worst thing that Rian Johnson did was try and demythologize Star Wars\\, which is all about its mythological like Heroes and Villains. Everything that was built up in Episode 7 was completely destroyed and humiliated in TLJ. The best way I can put this is: TLJ doesn\u2019t really build on anything that has been built on from over 40 years of Star Wars. ","true":true}
