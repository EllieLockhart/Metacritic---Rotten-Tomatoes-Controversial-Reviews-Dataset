Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers in review!\\n\\nOnly redeeming factor was some of the set piece scenes\\, the story was terribly conceived and poorly paced\\, the humour was over bearing and served to make a mockery of the otherwise quite serious content matter as well as devalue any credibility any scenes could have had.\\n\\nMark Hamill himself said that he fundamentally disagrees with director Rian Johnson's perception of his character 'Luke' and I could not agree more\\, the sheer rate at which classic characters are being picked off in this new series to make way for the new cast is bordering on genocidal (Rip admiral Akbar\\, you didn't get the death scene you richly deserved)\\, why on earth they couldn't keep admiral Akbar in command of the cruiser and have him make the ultimate sacrifice towards the end is mind boggling to me.\\nInstead we are lumped with this new admiral whom nobody cares for in the slightest and whom keeps uttering the phrase 'god speed rebels' instead of perhaps 'may the force be with you'\\, you know.... Like it was a star wars movie or something.\\n\\nMoving on\\, the casino world\\, far to relatable\\, served only to yank me ungracefully out of the star wars universe and plop me down somewhere in the last Vegas strip... It's not that far a stretch as anybody will be able to tell you if they have ever been there.\\n\\nFinally (by no means the last issue with the film) is Luke's death which was unsatisfying and carried no emotional weight which was a huge missed opportunity\\, all in all the director seemed more occupied with making social statements rather than making a good film\\, massive disappointment for me.\\n\\nI could rant on and on about this film but I will save anyone taking the time to read this the trouble\\, forget this film exists.","true":true}
