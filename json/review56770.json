Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The new trilogy excels at the level of inconsistencies\\, scripting facilities\\, in superficiality\\, with a deafening absence of a quality soundtrack.\\nNo captivating narration\\, characters little charismatic\\, this film brings nothing good to the universe.\\n\\nI have to put a bad note to alert Disney.\\nI hope they will think about their scenario for the next longer.","true":true}
