Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I will admit\\, upon initially seeing this movie\\, I didn\u2019t know what to think. But on a second viewing\\, I realized my initial unease was all tied up in my expectations for the film. It really threw me off - this film did not turn out the way I expected\\, which is a good thing. This is easily the most original and non-derivative Star Wars movie of all time. Not only that\\, but it had great character development\\, good humor (though a little out of place at times)\\, even pacing\\, and fantastic cinematography. It seems a lot of people posting reviews here are upset the story didn\u2019t go the way they wanted it to go. And that\u2019s understandable - initially\\, I was a bit put out too. Then I realized my expectations for the plot\u2019s direction (that had been built up over two years) were the only thing getting in my way of enjoying the movie. Pushing those aside and seeing this movie with an open mind\\, I really really enjoyed it. This is a great movie\\, easily better that the previous one\\, and I think it will be remembered as one of the best of the saga.","true":true}
