Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I feel nothing. No wait that's not true. I felt anger\\, confusion\\, despair and hopelessness as I left the theatre. Uncontrollable anger at those who decided to treat Luke and Leia's characters the way did in this movie. Confusion about who are we suppose to root for. Despair at the ugly and juvenile humour they out in for cheap laughs. Hopelessness that us fans has no say or power to do anything about it. Even they have the gall to deemed us bots and trolls for callling out this utter rubbish of a movie.\\n\\nIt's like a million voices cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced by the great evil mouse.","true":true}
