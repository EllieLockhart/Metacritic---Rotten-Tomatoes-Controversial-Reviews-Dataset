Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"a few parts fell flat and felt like filler but all in all great movie with some of the best character development in the franchise up to date. visually absolutely stunning acting hamill\\, ridley\\, and boyega were great though it felt like Driver was a bit short on his performance as kylo.","true":true}
