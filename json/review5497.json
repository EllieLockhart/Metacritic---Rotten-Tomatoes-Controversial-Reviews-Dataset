Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Destroyed the franchise by completely ignoring the groundwork laid by ep vii. Bad pacing. Felt preachy whatever the messages were. Royally botched one of my favorite childhood characters. If this is what Disney wants to give us\\, I hope they stop making all Star Wars films.","true":true}
