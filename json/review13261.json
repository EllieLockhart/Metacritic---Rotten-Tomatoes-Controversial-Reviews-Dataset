Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't understand why people didn't like this movie. It has a great story and it keeps the action going along. The only problem with it is how Snoke dies. It is kind of lousy like Count DuKoo's death. Great movie though\\, highly recommended!","true":true}
