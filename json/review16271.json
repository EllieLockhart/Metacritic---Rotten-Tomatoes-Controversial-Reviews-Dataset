Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019m not going to complain about the fact that some people didn\u2019t like it. Reality is that some \u201chardcore fans\u201d would not have been pleased no matter what happened with this film. This was the second best film\\, if not THE best in the franchise and it isn\u2019t close. Stop pretending like the original trilogy was perfect. ","true":true}
