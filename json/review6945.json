Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily my least favourite Star Wars film to date. The list of problems is endless. The plot is a mess\\, the humour is sickeningly forced and the Disney political agenda comes through as heavy handed as ever. Rian Johnson threw out everything that JJ set up in the Force Awakens. The films only saving grace is its visuals\\, yet that alone cannot undo the damage this film has done to the entire fanbase and to all the star wars films to come.","true":true}
