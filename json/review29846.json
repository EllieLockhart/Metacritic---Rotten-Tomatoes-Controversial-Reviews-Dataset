Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Risky and excellent film of Star Wars? Definitely yes. There is an excellent acting\\, visual\\, moral and a lot of memorizing scenes. Strange moments are present\\, but they fade in comparison with everything else. If you consider this film to be the worst of all\\, then you will get movies in the style of marvel\\, which everyone likes. \\\"Fear is the path to the dark side...fear leads to anger...anger leads to hate...hate leads to suffering\\\" - Yoda (c)","true":true}
