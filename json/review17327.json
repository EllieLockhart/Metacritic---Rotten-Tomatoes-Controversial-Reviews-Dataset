Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really was excited and was looking forward to this film.  Luke as willing to sacrifice himself to save his father the second most evil character in the star wars universe at the time. But his twin sister and best friends son had a few potentially fleeting dark thoughts so instead of trying to save and redeem his nephew like he did his father luke must murder him in his sleep without even confronting him.  Very poorly executed humor which didn't belong there it pulls you out of the epic story that is the star wars universe.  Plot holes and missed opportunities.  Who is snoke what is his story\\, why is he so powerful\\, where did he come from? Where did the first order come from? Did Luke even care about Han Solos death?  The main plot of a slow space chase that takes the whole movie to resolve is very weak and boring.  The first order had multiple ships just light speed away with a star destroyer and come back in front of the resistance.  Why does rey succeed at everything? Heroes need to fail and struggle so we can relate to there struggles and we get a big emotional payoff in the end when they finally succeed especially when you have 3 movies to tell the heroes story.  Just because this is the worst star wars film ever made does not mean all hope has been lost.  I still have \\\"hope\\\"\\, and love\\, for the star wars universe.","true":true}
