Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It feels like The Last Jedi is an attempt to restart the franchise (mid way through the film). There are a number of things I disagreed with and felt were pointless e.g. hyping up Snoke and Rey's pasts to reveal neither.\\nIt does seem that the writers are flirting with the idea that the side of the force you are on is more like real life and not binary\\, more that a culmination of decisions and reactions to grey situations can build you into a warrior on one side or the other - instead of a single decision made or being subjected to years of training.\\nOverall it's hard to take your eye's off\\, has unexpected character arcs and an unpredictable plot. This should have teed it up for a fantastic reception\\, but there is just something missing from The Last Jedi; somehow it is missing the killer blows that defined the original Star Wars trilogy.","true":true}
