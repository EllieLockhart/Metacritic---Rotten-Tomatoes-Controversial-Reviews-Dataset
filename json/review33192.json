Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such a letdown. Snoke is completely wasted and Rey's lineage makes no sense given the Skywalker lightsaber called to her in the Force Awaken. Casino scene is just a waste of time and Leia Poppins is farcical. Final showdown between Kylo and Luke was laughable. This movie should have been one of the best in the saga\\, instead it's one of the most disappointing","true":true}
