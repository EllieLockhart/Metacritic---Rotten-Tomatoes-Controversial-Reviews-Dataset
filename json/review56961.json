Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst of all the Star Wars film\\, un-enjoyable\\, un-watchable\\, terribly written\\, so many plot holes\\, characters are destroyed by becoming the opposite of themselves for no reason\\, it's a shocking film Rian Johnson has no idea about space or gravity or how a vacuum works\\, it's a joke\\, he's a terrible writer and director\\, it's lazy and creates more questions than it answers\\, no real story\\, absolute mess of a film and I LOVE Star Wars\\, it is my absolute favourite film franchise ever but this is such a let down I am genuinely gutted about how abysmal this film was\/is. \\n\\nOnly positive is the music.","true":true}
