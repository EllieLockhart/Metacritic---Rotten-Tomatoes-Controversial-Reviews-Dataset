{"101487":196104,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When I left the theater last night\\, I thought WOW that was an entertaining film. But the longer I process what I just watched\\, the more and more I dislike this newest addition to Star Wars. While there were plenty of edge of my seat\\, bad-ass moments\\, there are several more problems with the story\/characters that I just can\u2019t get passed. The Last Jedi is the longest of the Star Wars film and it feels like it. The whole movie took place over--what\\, 18 hours? And the timeline made no sense. Finn and Rose side story was ridiculous and their asinine plan didn\u2019t work anyway. (You expect me to believe that in the entire Rebellion--on a ship of 400 people--you don\u2019t have a competent code-breaker?) There was no character development for ANYONE. Everyone ends the movie with the same alignment and motivations as before. Also\\, there was humor where it didn\u2019t belong. Cheap laughs broke what could\u2019ve been wonderful tension in many scenes. But hands down the most disappointing thing about this movie is Luke. We spend hardly anytime with him and Rey and when we do it destroys who Luke is as a person\/Jedi. It contradicts his character in every way. The final fight scene was such a let down that it was a hologram. It was a pointless \u201csacrifice.\u201d I have no idea what they plan on doing for the final film but I\u2019m not excited about it.","true":true}
