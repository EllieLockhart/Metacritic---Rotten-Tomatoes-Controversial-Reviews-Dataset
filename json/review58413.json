Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After watching this movie I had mixed feelings. I am a huge Star Wars fan and have a real soft spot for these movies. As soon as i see the iconic Star Wars logo and hear the blast of John Williams music in the cinema I'm taken on a nostalgia trip that makes it hard for me to be objective when writing a review. \\n\\nFirst of all let me say there will be spoilers here so if uv not seen the movie then please stop reading! \\n\\nThe movie starts with a scene reminiscent of the beginning of Empire Strikes Back with The Resistance trying to escape the First Order from their rebel base. There are great special effects here but there are missteps in tone that are hard to overlook. General Hux is mocked by Po in a scene which reminded me of Bart Simpson calling Moe's Tavern with a prank call. This seemed to undermine Hux's character from the outset and this theme of ridiculing Hux continues throughout the movie which is a shame as he could have been set up as a real villain which would only have benefited the storyline. \\n\\nI was also confused with the power shift in Last Jedi. The First Order were a rising threat in the Force Awakens but now they seem to dominate the galaxy and The Resistance are just a bunch of rebels with hardly any resources. \\n\\nWe then move on to the scene where Rey hands Luke Skywalker the light saber. Set up as an emotional scene in Force Awakens this tone is just discarded in Last Jedi for no particular reason. There is no explanation to why a map was left to Luke's location\\, why R2D2 suddenly turned on and why Luke's lightsaber called out to Rey in the Force Awakens. These plot threads and many more are just ignored and this lack of continuity from the first movie reduced my enjoyment of this movie.\\n\\nI also felt that the characters of Rey\\, Finn and Po that were set up so well in the Force Awakens are undermined and misused in this movie. Finn is sent on a meaningless sub-plot with a pointless character called Rose. Po is turned into a testosterone filled hot head with no respect for authority which makes it hard to relate to him. Rey meanwhile is given no training or backstory to account for her mastery of The Force which again does not make her relatable as a character as her powers seem unrealistic.\\n\\nI also think this movie has the worst ending scene of all the Star Wars movies with the audience taken away from the reality of the and to a bunch of sickeningly sweet kids who are playing with Star Wars action figures and one who can control the Force without any training. This scene is absolutely pointless and shoe horned into the movie for no apparent reason. \\n\\nI'm afraid this movie does not leave me looking forward to the last in the trilogy and that's a shame as the storyline had real potential that seems to have been wasted.","true":true}
