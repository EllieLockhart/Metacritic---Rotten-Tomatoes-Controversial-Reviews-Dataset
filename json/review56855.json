Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is an amazing deleted scene in A New Hope called Tosche Station. It helps build a meaningful backstory for the main character\\, yet it was ultimately removed from the film. The reason was simple: Star Wars is fast paced\\, and the character development is seen through actions rather than being served on a platter to the viewer. The Last Jedi violates this tenfold. If a backstory building scene for Luke Skywalker is not important enough to be kept in the final cut in A New Hope\\, then why should we be watching pointless backstory for Rose\\, a pointless character? Furthermore\\, much of the film was spend showing how Poe evolves before our eyes from a hotheaded kid to a thoughtful leader (third time's a charm!). Han Solo didn't receive such blantantly obvious attention and went from a self centered scoundrel to a hero in a far more satisfying and believable way.\\n\\nStar Wars follows heroes and not factions. This is what seperates it from Star Trek the most. While in Star Trek the crew works together to solve an issue\\, Star Wars has always focused all of its attention on the main characters. This was not the case in The Last Jedi\\, where most of the movie was spent running away in space\\, no joke. Far more time was much needed for our heroes\\, but Disney failed to deliver.\\n\\nNext\\, TLJ tried to be a Star Wars film so hard that it does not feel like Star Wars at all. In the Star Wars movies that we are accustomed to\\, the empire and rebels change and we are exposed to new technologies\\, species\\, and more. On Hoth we were introduced to AT-ATs\\, and on Endor we saw fast paced speeder battles. In TLJ we get rebels in a trench with turrets on a snowy looking planet defending a rebel base against AT-ATs. This is so similar to The Empire Strikes Back that it does not even feel like Star Wars anymore. There was a frustratingly high amount of similarities between the second entry in both trilogies. In both films the rebels run from the Empire in space for most of it while our hero trains. At first our hero is rejected\\, and then is trained by the jedi master. After seeing the closing scene with a force sensative slave boy\\, I am honestly expecting a second The Phantom Menace. Maybe he will race the horse thing instead of podracing and will gain his freedom. At this point it's just a mess.\\n\\nMy overall thoughts: The Last Jedi tries to recapture the feeling of Star Wars but further isolates itself from the greatness of the Original Trilogy. While its best scenes are great\\, a very un-Star Wars like pacing and manotony ultimately holds it back. I will generously give it a 6\/10 for the Yoda scene and the Snoke scene\\, but the reviews are too positive to let that slide.","true":true}
