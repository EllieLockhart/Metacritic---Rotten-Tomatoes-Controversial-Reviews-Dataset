Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Every single expection I had was ruined you want to see cool force powers don't see this movie\\, you expect anything at of snoke don't see this movie. You want trading between Luke and rei this movie also isn't for you. Garbage worst Star Wars movie I've ever saw","true":true}
