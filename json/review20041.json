Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was just awful. Phantom Menace seems like a masterpiece compared to this incredibly boring\\, plotless\\, heartless\\, unfunny\\, piece of junk. \\n\\nThe Force Awakens was not a perfect movie\\, but at least it was a Star Wars movie and it had heart. \\nGeorge Lucas please come back\\, all is forgiven.","true":true}
