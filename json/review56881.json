Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There's overacting\\, silly jokes\\, cartoonish villains\\, a Vice Admiral that feels like a preschool teacher\\, pointless plot threads\\, cool new characters tossed aside\\, two potentially moving sacrifices erased\\, Benicio Del Toro channeling Bobby Boucher from The Waterboy\\, force training that goes nowhere\\, a misunderstanding of the Eastern spiritual origins of the Star Wars mythos\\, hell\\, a misunderstanding of mythos. The teases that left us wanting more background that honors the rich depth\\, history\\, and texture of this fictional world for two years\\, instead lead to shallow dismissals\\,  missed opportunities for transcendent moments that resonate. There seems to be no connection to the Chuck Wendig books\\, several key tropes from The Force Awakens go unaddressed\\, and the entire yoda scene felt shallow\\, tacked on (there never were central \\\"sacred texts\\\" so to pretend its a big deal to burn them rings false and hollow and contrived\\, and do we really have to turn this Eastern spiritual sage character into a \\\"buck up little camper\\, don't they grow up so fast?\\\" PTA chair? A master is not a parent\\, and if the great lesson of Luke's golden years is that \\\"eventually they outgrow us\\,\\\" then he's been pretty dumb all along. This is a study in how to take rich characters and make them feel flat. The same beats played over and over and then are strangely dismissed. The one saving grace is a couple of great performances by the leads\\, but the film does so much damage to the brand\\, who cares. It looks shiny enough on the surface\\, but its an extremely unsatisfying film for a long-time fan. We could have had a similar \\\"let the past die\\\" movie that was also richly suggestive\\, expansive\\, and honored the character arcs of the original trilogy. What a waste.","true":true}
