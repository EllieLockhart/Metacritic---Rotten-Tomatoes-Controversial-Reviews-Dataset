Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The positives: stunning visuals\\, cinematography\\, and score. \\nThe negatives: literally everything else!!! Horrible storyline\\, painfully bad writing\/dialogue\\, SJW political agenda ridiculousness injected everywhere\\, stupid\\, campy forced humor\\, tons of unanswered questions\\, plot holes everywhere\\, not one shred of that Star Wars magic\\, present even so slightly in The Force Awakens...sooooo baaaaad!!! Johnson\\, Disney and Kennedy have taken a 40 year sci fi legacy and thrown it right down the drain with this train wreck of a movie. Help us JJ Abrams\\, your'e our only hope.","true":true}
