Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Looooooooooved the movie! \\n\\nI loved how Luke died with purpose just like Obi and Yoda did. Loved how Kylo shows us that he can not be controlled and has the ability to be more powerful than Snoke. \\n\\nI also love that this felt like it was more about Luke then it was about Rey. This movie was amazing closure for Luke's character. \\n5\/5","true":true}
