Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The more I reflect on what I saw the more disappointed I am with this movie. It is way to preachy about girl power and social injustice that never should have made it into the film because it was pointless to advancing the story.  In addition\\, does every white male have to be inherently evil in the \\\"new\\\" Star Wars universe? Furthermore\\, there were plenty of characters that really didn't need to exist altogether.  Lastly\\, the plot was convoluted as hell and the story just wasn't very good. I am disappointed especially after how much I enjoyed Rogue One and how entertaining the Force Awakens was.  Is it so hard for Hollywood to just make movies that are entertaining and fun? There are plenty of other platforms to use to try to score social and political points. I really want my $15 back.","true":true}
