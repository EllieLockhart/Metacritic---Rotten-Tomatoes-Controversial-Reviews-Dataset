Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst one of the saga. a terrible script followed by a series of nonsense and events happening just because if they make the latest Jedi a slow and boring movie. It should be noted that at least 10 minutes of the film contribute to the story but the rest is absolutely disposable","true":true}
