Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As an avid Star Wars fan I looked forward to the next in the new trilogy but was instead met with an unfortunate\\, separated and safe run of events that I struggled to catch on to. Star Wars is and has become the largest movie series in recent years and with this has bought new fans along the way from oldies re-ignition there passion for a galaxy far far away and young fans\\, the new trilogy being their introduction to the saga. This has therefore been a blessing and a curse as Disney have tried to to reach out to the largest demographic possible unfortunately appeasing in a serious way.","true":true}
