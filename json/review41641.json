Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is incoherent. It's trying so hard to be \\\"different\\\" that it forget to tell a good story. The humor is the type of humor that will not pass the test of time. Rian Johnson did not develop the characters properly\\, he did not develop the story or advance the characters that the force awakens excellently set up.. He just sought to be \\\"different\\\" for the sake of being different. He got different. This is easily one of the worst Star Wars movies in the history of Star Wars Films.","true":true}
