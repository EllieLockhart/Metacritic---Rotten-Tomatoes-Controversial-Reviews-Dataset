Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ignore the rotten user reviews. I'm a huge Star Wars fan\\, and I loved this movie. Definitely one of the best in the series\\, it's almost as good as Empire Strikes Back. I liked the touches of humor and pathos\\, and found the film to be very emotional. The new creatures are wonderful\\, and the attention to detail in the effects is phenomenal. The cinematography is gorgeous\\, and the acting is top notch. Something seems odd in all these negative reviews contrary to the great critical reviews! I can't wait to see this again\\, and Rian Johnson is the perfect choice to direct the next trilogy. See it and decide for yourself!","true":true}
