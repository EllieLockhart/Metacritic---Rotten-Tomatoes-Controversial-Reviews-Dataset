Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"90% of the movie can be cut and nothing would change \\\"plot\\\" wise.\\nThe plot is a joke.\\nIf you want a movie made of trailer fodder that comes out to nothing at all\\, go see it. If not then save your money and maybe see it when it hits RedBox. Visually Beautiful.","true":true}
