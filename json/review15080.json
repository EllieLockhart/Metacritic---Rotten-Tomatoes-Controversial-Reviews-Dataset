Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left the theater not fully satisfied. Not that it wasn't a good movie\\, it just didn't scratch the star wars itch I had. do me of the Characters are annoying and the added humor that Disney loves takes away from serious scenes. It's not an amazing film but it's definitely worth seeing on the big screen.","true":true}
