The infiltration system works well and there is a serious improvement on AI (your companion can be spotted by the enemies\\, even though they get sometimes in your way).\rThe graphics are great but what is really impressive is the tangibility of the environment and the animations and facial expressions. I especially loved exploring all the areas and feeling that humidity of Seattle. The facial expressions in cut-scenes or in-game are really on point and I don\u2019t expect to see a game having that level of details for a long time. When you handle enemies\\, watching their expression is uncanny. The global atmosphere and universe is really well done and I was hooked during the entire game. However\\, there are some pacing issues and after the credits you can\u2019t remember every confrontations because there are plenty\\, maybe too much. At some point the game starts to feel quite repetitive even though there are always a jump scare\\, or a character being tortured\\, mutilated or shot at some point\\, to galvanize the pace of the journey.\rThe game is one of the most violent I have ever seen. Some scenes are quite shocking and will haunt you forever. However\\, gore and violence sometimes seems to be an easy shortcut to get rid of characters and tricky situations that would have actually been interesting to see more elaborated. The game is very dramatic and depressing and will leave you emotionally exhausted at the end.\r\rI was however greatly disappointed by the characters development in general. The game never managed to make me empathize with the new characters introduced. At one point you can feel like the writers wants you to like one character in particular\\, so they put everything they can to make you like her\\, but it felt forced. I wanted to feel and understand what Naughty Dogs wanted me to feel and understand but I couldn\u2019t\\, because they did such a good job of pissing the player in the first hours of the game that you can\u2019t get attached no matter what you will share with this character. I was also disappointed by the lack of interactions between the protagonists during exploration which helps building the characters and getting attached to them. So there was a lots of awkward silences which could have been used to build the characters and make them more likable\\, human.\rSo how can I rate a game that is so good and so well polished\\, but from which I feel emotionally excluded.\r\rThe Last of us part II\\, is a good game. Yet I understand the division in the player base\\, because it depends on everyone sensibility and capability to get over his own resentment. I can\u2019t deny it\u2019s unprecedented. But was it really intentional though? I globally liked the experience and would recommend to play it\\, however\\, on a pure writing and character building aspect\\, that's a big disappointment.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
