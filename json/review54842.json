Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It isn't five stars but i got to offset all the hate... it's really not a one star movie.  People are just being picky snobs.  With that said\\, i wish there was a little more saber action and a little less time with Luke and Rey scenes.  Overall however\\, it is an entertaining Star Wars.  Din't like it as much as first episode but that doesn't mean i didn't like this film.  It was just good... which i find kinda okay for a second episode.  I just hope the last episode will take everyone critique and be epic\\, but will def. watch it... Star Wars isn't dead... it has a lot of potential and badassness.","true":true}
