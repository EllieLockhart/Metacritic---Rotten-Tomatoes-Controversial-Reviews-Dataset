Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"so sad!!! the majority of the actors are great\\, they just don't have a fcking script to do their art. my heart is bleeding. who is Mark Hamill forced to play in this movie? Certainly not Luke Skywalker. i feel his pain.","true":true}
