Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overview: Boring\\, mind-numbingly predictable\\, garbage humor\\, exceedingly preachy\\, felt like a rehash of older movies with less depth\/emotion\\, wasteful plot lines\\, BUT visually spectacular. \\n\\nWorst Offenses:\\n1) Snoke's Death. This scene was stupendously dumb and lazy. The most powerful sith in at least a generation\\, capable of building up a new world with incredibly advanced technology seemingly from nothing\\, possessing incredible Force abilities never before seen (in the movies)\\, is killed by a cheap trick. Nevermind the fact that this is an enormous waste of a character who could\\, potentially\\, have had incredible depth and background\\, it's just anticlimactic and lazy. \\n\\n2) Rey's refusal of Ben Solo. Of all the predictable scenes in this movie\\, this one best exemplifies how thoroughly uncreative the writing\/direction behind this movie was. Despite spending much of this VERY long movie building up the relationship between Rey and Ben\\, establishing Rey's affinity for both light and dark side (the cave scene especially)\\, and paving the way for something new to be created in the SW movie universe\\, the age-old tropes and clich\u00e9s are enforced\\, and Rey and Ben assume their tired roles. For example\\, had Rey and Ben abandoned the rebellion and the First Order\\, the Jedi and the Sith\\, and gone on to found a new order that emphasized balance between light and dark (fitting for both of their characters)\\, that would have at least been a fresh and interesting take on the SW universe\\, with plenty of lore to pull from. Really though\\, anything other than the expected course of this scene would have been pleasant.\\n\\n3) Admiral Holdo's (purple hair) lightspeed attack. While I do appreciate the creativity presented in this scene in using a new and very visually exciting attack\\, the execution was pretty poor. Given the staggering power of such an attack\\, why has no one ever so much as thought to use it before? If you're going to introduce something like that\\, a small bit of explanation as to why\\, in a world full of suicide bombers\\, no one has ever attempted that before on screen. Additionally\\, this scene fails in the context of the larger movie. How many ships did Admiral Holdo lose before it magically ocurred to her\\, the first time for anyome in the galaxy\\, to use lightspeed as an attack? A lot. For a character more or less exalted by the movie's writing\\, her actions and thought processes are pretty flimsy. \\n\\nBut hey\\, it was a very pretty movie.  And who doesn't love porgs?","true":true}
