Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Misses the mark and fails to create new magic for the series\\, with shallow storytelling and symbolism\\, the public opinions are divided between new and old fans\\, the new fans to the series cannot understand why this isn't a good movie\\, and the old cannot comprehend why this is accepted as star wars. One thing is certain\\, the people here at rotten tomatoes must have been bribed \\nsignificantly to give it a 92% ratio.","true":true}
