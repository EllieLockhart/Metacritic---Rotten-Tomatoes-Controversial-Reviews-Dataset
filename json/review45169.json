Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Uninteresting and forces new characters into the story with little explanation. Vice admiral holdo is apparently leia's best friend but she's never been seen before this film for an hour at max. The plot also makes no sense since the first order super carrier could just release one of the six star destroyers it carries to jump to Hyperspace and pinch the resistance into a corner. Nothing makes sense about this film logically.","true":true}
