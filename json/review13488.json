Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If a Star Wars movie has this much turmoil and drama then I don't even have to see it to make my own decision. Pathetic that society has come to this. Hollywood has had to shove their social justice agenda down a trilogy that never began that way.","true":true}
