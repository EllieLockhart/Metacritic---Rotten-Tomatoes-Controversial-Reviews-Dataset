Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awefull sjw cr$p. Only good thing was mark hamill SPOILERS....and they got rid of him.. f^#* you disney and the director and the sjw writers. Starwars is dead.","true":true}
