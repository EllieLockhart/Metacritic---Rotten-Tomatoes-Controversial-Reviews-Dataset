Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The person I feel most sorry for is Mark Hammil.  \\n\\nHe's been a loyal flag bearer for Star Wars\\, engaging with the fans\\, being upbeat and excited\\, long after the other stars became jaded tired of it.  To have to act those scenes\\, and make the character that you love do things that they just wouldn't do must have been heart breaking.  \\n\\nImagine writing a new Harry Potter book but making Harry is a disloyal coward.  Then have him die at the end and pronounced a failure.  That's what Rian Johnson did with Luke.  \\n\\nMark\\, if you're out there\\, we don't blame you!","true":true}
