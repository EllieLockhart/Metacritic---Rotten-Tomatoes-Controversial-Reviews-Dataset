Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie that killed (or at the very least\\, crippled) Star Wars. Boring plot(s)\\, inconsistent characters\\, shoehorned social\/political commentary\\, takes shots at its own fans and is just generally unentertaining. Backlash from this movie has led to \\\"Solo\\\" flopping\\, SW toys\\, games and book sales all declining\\, and a fractured fanbase.\\n\\nGave it 1\/2 star extra just for Kylo Ren being an interesting character\\, a single good plot twist\\, and some nice artistic touches.","true":true}
