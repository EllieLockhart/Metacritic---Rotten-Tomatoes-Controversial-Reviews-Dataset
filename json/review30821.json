Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Snoke's 30 minute character development sums up this film. When people ask me what I thought of the film\\, the best comparison I can give is that it's very similar to star wars Battlefront 2. It looks visually stunning however lacks any level of deep meaningful story or entertainment value. When you take a step back and realise the overarching story and development of the rebel alliance in this film is simply one ship chasing another and waiting for it to run out of fuel. I have given up all hope of Disney making a good star wars film. It felt like a 2 and half hour stretched out episode of star wars rebels\\, but one of the terrible pointless episodes Disney is now producing. Im a massive massive star wars fan.. was there for the midnight release showing\\, had work very early the next morning.. And was left overwhelmingly disappointed. Quite honestly any star wars fan could have come up with a more exciting and meaningful star wars story in about 10 seconds","true":true}
