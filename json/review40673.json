Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is without a doubt one of the top 2 films in the franchise. Perfect pacing\\, action sequences that were important to the plot and character development\\, and an engaging\\, original story that never takes the easy way out. \\n\\nMuch of the ridiculous hate surrounding TLJ seems to be around the way the film handles Luke Skywalker. Disney did not take the easy route of the expanded universe as written by hacks and available to anyone to spoil themselves over the past 25+ years. They came up with something original and many fans with their theories can't handle it. Remember Mark Hammill is older now than Alec Guinness was when he played Obi Wan. No one complained about the type of role Obi Wan had. Or how he died. Or demanded to know tedious things like who his parents were\\, etc. \\n\\nBack in the days of the original series\\, no one wasted time coming up with theories\\, and trying to impress people online. They just let the stories unfold.","true":true}
