Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I will begin with what I loved about this movie: Sound? Visuals? Music? Spot on. Those get a full 5\/5\\, A+\\, and a gold star. Also\\, everything that had to do with the Force\\, Kylo\\, Rey\\, and Luke's storylines- very cool\\, very well done except for a few MAJOR problems I talk about below. \\n\\nAs for why the movie only gets two stars in my book... look. It's Star Wars. It's wizards with magic swords In Space. This film requires a suspension of disbelief to enjoy. But if you ask me to suspend my disbelief\\, you have to be consistent with HOW and WHEN I suspend it. You can't be dropping bombs- literally\\, dropping bombs out of bomb bay doors a la WW2\\, relying on gravity to get the bomb to its target- in outer space one minute\\, and then twenty minutes later have people sucked out into the vacuum of space. Either there's Zero-G or there isn't. Pick one.\\n\\nAlso\\, your horrible \\\"Fleet Killer\\\" Dreadnought has no shields? If one X-Wing and one bomber blow it up\\, it's not a \\\"Fleet Killer\\\"! It's a gun made of wet tissue paper! Even in Jedi\\, they had to blow up the shield generators on the Super Star Destroyer before it was destroyed.\\n\\nPhasma and Admirable Holdo are characters with remarkable potential to inspire new\\, young audiences with their cunning (Phasma) and bravery (Holdo). But instead of using these characters to their full effect\\, they are treated terribly as throwaway and ultimately forgettable characters. Phasma is now a joke\\, like Jar Jar if he wore Boba Fett's armor. And Holdo... won't be reappearing\\, I think.\\n\\nSpeaking of Holdo\\, she does something in this film that completely upends Star Wars Lore in terms of how space battles work. Something that can even the odds in any situation where the Good Guys are outnumbered and outgunned by the Bad Guys\\, can now be done in every space battle ever\\, and there is no explanation as to why it wasn't used in battles like Endor in Episode 6 or Coruscant in Episode 3. There is no explanation for why it wasn't used before if it's as effective as it's shown on screen\\, and no reason why it shouldn't be used ever again. None. Now\\, every time you see a Star Wars movie\\, in your head\\, you'll be asking yourself \\\"Why aren't they just doing what Holdo did?\\\"\\n\\nRevelations in this movie are scant and unfulfilling. Nothing is revealed about Snoke\\, but I'm at peace with that- we learned nothing about the Emperor in Empire or Return of the Jedi. But the revelation about why Kylo turned to the Dark Side flies in the face of all established character motivations for Luke. After all\\, he went to the Emperor's Throne Room of the Death Star\\, confronted both his father and his father's master\\, and risked almost certain death\\, all because he felt a tiny spark of good in Darth Vader. You're going to tell me that this Luke Skywalker would be the same one to decide there's absolutely no hope of redeeming his own nephew\\, so he's got to be put down like a dog? No. That's ridiculous.\\n\\nRey's parentage is revealed... sorta. The person who does the revealing has every reason to lie about it\\, but if true\\, it ruins every defense of \\\"Rey is not a Mary Sue\\\" that I made to friends and family for two years now. Rey knows how to lift an avalanche of boulders\\, mind trick passersby\\, and fly the Millenium Falcon as well has Han\/Chewie\\, and she does all of these things with no explanation of her skills. And there is still no reason given for her to be this good at everything she does. Her strength in the Force is explained in one line\\, like she's Kylo's polar opposite generated to counter his own power. But Kylo has had years of training from Luke Skywalker and Snoke. Rey has had... a week in-universe to get this good? Maybe?\\n\\nThe theme of this movie is how one should look to the future. Kylo says you need to burn the past down\\, cut ties with it completely\\, kill it even\\, in order to embrace the future. Rey represents moving on by learning from the past\\, not necessarily enshrining it.\\n\\nUnfortunately\\, Rian Johnson went to the Dark Side when making this movie\\, burning down everything that came before just to make it look cool and play \\\"Gotcha!\\\" with our expectations.\\n\\nDespite all this\\, I am excited by the fact that Rian is getting his own trilogy and he's going to tell a new story with it. I just wish he showed a little appreciation for plugging plot holes and giving characters who will not be in his stories even the slightest amount of thought.","true":true}
