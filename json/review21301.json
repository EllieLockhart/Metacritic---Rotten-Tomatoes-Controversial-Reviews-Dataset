Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went in with extremely high hopes and as an avid star wars fan for years; I was disappointed. I didn't realize I was paying for 150 minutes of dialogue that changed the entire dynamic of luke and pointless subplots to prepare for a new movie. I will say however that with how they ended the movie\\, I believe that the next movie will be great because of the new possible creative environment. They set it up to remove the old and move on to a whole new franchise. But once again\\, DID NOT enjoy this specific movie.","true":true}
