Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It feels like this was written by some who hates star wars and has been making fun of it his whole life and finally gets to ruin it for the rest of us. this movie is fulled with stupid scenes that make no sense. Before going into this movie think this is what my evil  brother\/sister would do to ruin the movie.","true":true}
