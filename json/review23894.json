Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Make no mistake\\, this is a fan fiction movie for Kathleen Kennedy to push an overtly feminist political narrative.  Every male character is portrayed as a brash\\, incompetent child that needs saving by Mary Sue females.  Every intelligent decision\\, heroic action or noble sacrifice is made by a female\\, despite any prior plot\\, character development or laws of physics.  \\n\\nThe entire plot centers around a ridiculous\\, low-speed chase using space instead of water.  Lasers now fly in parabolic arcs\\, bombs \\\"drop\\\" in zero gravity but people do not\\, hyperspace is seemingly unavailable as means to cut off escaping ships and when ships \\\"run out of gas\\\" they simply stop in dead in space\\, completely ignoring inertia and any previously established laws of physics\\, science fiction or otherwise.\\n\\nOther ridiculous plot lines involve Chewie killing and cooking 2 porgs\\, yet someone the third\\, although horrified\\, simply accepts this and becomes his bff.  Finn saves Rose by dragging her on a sled\\, leaving a huge red line in the sand\\, yet not a single Imperial fires on them.  Yoda becomes a comedian in the afterlife.  Rey displays more Force ability\\, without training\\, than Anakin\\, Luke and Obi Wan put together\\, simply because she's a girl.  The take home is that anyone can be the greatest Jedi ever\\, as long as you have two x chromosomes.  This movie completely invalidates the original trilogy\\, diminishes the characters by having them do literally nothing of note since defeating the empire and then summarily disposes of them on or off screen.\\n\\nIf you want a real critic review by someone not paid by Disney look at either cnn or variety.  http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/12\/12\/entertainment\/star-wars-the-last-jedi-review\/index.html","true":true}
