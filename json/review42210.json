Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie's plot is a lot of fan service sloppily glued together by uninteresting characters on who are more caught up with an SJW crusade than for any character or plot development. Its a testament to low bar expected of this community of film critics that success is based on an orgy of visually appealing affects\\, blatantly sycophantic characters\\, pointless fan-service and not much else. If Disney is the future of western culture I'm glad the have a trajectory towards failure\\, let someone else have a turn.","true":true}
