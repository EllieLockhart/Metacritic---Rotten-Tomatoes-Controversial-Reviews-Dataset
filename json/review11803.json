Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How the HELL did paid critics give this abortion of a movie 91%?!?!  If this doesn't show that disney owns the media\\, or everyone has a BS agenda nothing does. This movie spit in the face of all the fans who have been there since day 1. Rather  than tell a story\\, the Rain a hole wanted to push his agenda on the fans\\, and gave us a steaming pile of crap. His \\\"film\\\" has ruined Star Wars for me and many others. Thanks\\, dick","true":true}
