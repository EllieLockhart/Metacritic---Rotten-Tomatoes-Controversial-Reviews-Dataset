Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic film. I understand there is a divide amongst fans. But when you think about it\\, people complained that The Force Awakens was too similar to A New Hope. The Last Jedi was a fresh Star Wars movie that springboarded off of its predecessor incredibly well and went in very unexpected directions\\, to my everlasting\\, pleasant surprise. I highly recommend this film to all. ","true":true}
