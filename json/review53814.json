{"101487":127042,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-23","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hands down the worst SW film. I'll take attack of the clones over this farce. \\n\\nThe Force Awakens really breathed new life into the series and set up some really interesting ideas\\, which The last jedi destroyed and threw away. Episode 8 is awful across the board. The story is absurd. This awful slow speed chase which makes no sense. They can track them through light speed\\, they have thousands of disposable tie fighters that they could launch and destroy the remaining fleet. \\n\\nI originally thought that luke went to the island to gain some knowledge\\, recover and rise from the ashes to face his unfinished business of Ren and Snoke\\, but no. Apparently he's just running away and giving up. And if he wanted to absolutely not be found\\, then WHY PROVIDE A MAP to where he is at in The force awakens. It makes no sense. \\n\\nSnoke was set up to be a really interesting character\\, but is just thrown away with NO character development. His death could have been really powerful\\, If I knew SOMETHING about him\\, but we knew nothing. I can't invest in someone I know nothing about. \\n\\nRey is OP in the force awakens\\, but I let that go since I thought there was a reason\\, but now that we know that she came from nothing\\, now everything she does makes no sense. She came from nothing\\, was alone as an orphan on a junk planet with NO TRAINING\\, but somehow is a master jedi\\, master fighter\\, master pilot\\, master engineer and unstoppable. I'm not buying it. Is ludicrous. \\n\\nThe \\\"in your face\\\" and \\\"on the nose\\\" social commentary of the Casino planet makes me nauseous. The rebellion has done some nasty stuff over the years as well. They aren't squeaky clean in their actions\\, but Rose is ready to judge everyone and everything going on. \\n\\nThe last jedi ruins everything.","true":true}
