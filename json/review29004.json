Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really enjoyed this movie\\, it is not your father's Star Wars and that is a good thing. I have seen every Star Wars movie and this is a good as any out there\\, go in with an open mind and just enjoy it\\, things change times change.","true":true}
