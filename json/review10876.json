Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hated it. Hated everything about it. Didn't go see Solo because of it. Won't go see Ep 9 because of it. It did what even the prequels couldn't do; it put me into brand divorce. I was a lifelong fan but they won't get one more penny out of me. \\n\\nI guess I'm part of the \\\"Small Vocal Minority\\\" I keep hearing about in these articles about TLJ. Well\\, maybe when we don't show up for Ep 9 they will start to take us seriously. One of the arguments people make in support of TLJ is that it made $1.2 billion dollars. Yeah\\, that's because a lot of star wars fans went to see it\\, the problem for Lucasfilm is that a lot of the people who walked out of the theater after TLJ were not star wars fans anymore.
