{"101487":133356,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had high hopes going in. Afterward I was left scratching my head. Not sure how Force Awakens seemingly had much more criticism than this. IMO the movie was entertaining but really failed to deliver what just about everyone wanted to see in a follow up to TFA. JJ did a really good job with TFA even though it was far from perfect. There were so many things that people were excited to see and learn about the characters after TFA\\, and TLJ failed to deliver.\\n\\nFirst\\, everyone wondered about Ray's background. This movie dropped the ball horribly in that respect. Regardless of weather Kylo Ren was lying to her or not\\, this was a major failure in the movie. Going into Ep 9 we still have no idea\\, and if what KR said was true\\, that is completely uninteresting.\\n\\nSecondly\\, fans like me who grew up watching Vader\\, Luke\\, Han\\, and Lea\\, were so excited to see the return of Luke Skywalker. Mark Hamill did a fine job in the role\\, but the script he was given was a total dud. No wonder he made a statement that he wishes they would have followed GL original outline for EP 7 - 9. I was one who was happy to see someone else take over the reigns\\, but I honestly think at this point that Lucas might have done better. The fact that Luke never left the original location of the first Jedi Temple was horrible. The idea that he was using the force to appear to everyone else on a different planet is absurd. The scene where the AT ATs blasted skywalker to oblivion\\, to have him just walk away was a head scratcher to say the least. I wondered\\, is he using a hologram?!?! Then seeing that he was sitting on a rock the whole time?!?! WTF!!! Then for him to turn over and die afterward was utterly bizarre! Wouldn't it have been so much better for Kylo to face Luke and for Luke to sacrifice himself same as Obi Wan Kenobi did in his presence in ANH? Then disappearing as Obi Wan did would have been so much better.\\n\\nThird\\, how they handled the Leah situation was just brutal. Surviving being exposed to deep space\\, opening her eyes\\, and using the force to maneuver through space to the airlock?!?! This was just terrible! It would have been better to let her die in that scene being as they made the wrong choice to not let anyone play her character\\, or digitally recreate Lea. Seeing Lea and Han together was one of the most powerful moments in TFA. It was such a shame to never get to see Luke\\, Lea\\, and Han together again. Many were so anxious to see the reunion between Lea and Luke. What a let down that the only interaction was for Luke to approach Lea and kiss her forehead\\, meanwhile he was really just floating on a rock at the Jedi Temple?!?! Terrible!\\n\\nFourth\\, Snoke?!?! Everyone wondered\\, Is he a Sith? Is it Palpatine? Is it Darth Plageous? Who is Snoke? Guess what we get? A BIG FAT ZERO! He seemed like an interesting Villain. Very evil\\, ugly\\, and powerful. And then he went out in a way that was more of a disappointment than the final Obi Wan vs Maul battle in Rebels. What we got was very unfulfilling to say the least.\\n\\nFinally\\, what if anything interesting does this give to JJ for Epsiode 9? Unlike TFA which shocked us all by seeing the dramatic death of Han Solo\\, learning that Kylo Ren was Ben Solo\\, learning that Ben Solo was trained by Luke and turned to the dark side\\, TLJ gave us no blockbuster discoveries\\, and left little interesting plot lines for Ep 9. The Resistance is basically annihilated\\, there is only one untrained Jedi (but then again not really)\\, and one force weilder from the dark side who is a bit on the whiny side. Neither is very impressive in there own right. Neither is close to as powerful as Snoke. There is Nobody to train Ray. Kylo is not a great Villain at all. Unlike when I went into seeing TLJ\\, going into Ep 9 I have no sense of excitement about the things I am eager to learn in the next movie after what transpired. JJ certainly has his work cut out for him. in the next one.\\n\\nEven though I'm so disappointed about the direction Johnson chose to take\\, I thought the movie was very entertaining. The comedy was way over the top at times but mostly effective. The battle scenes were very good. The Dreadnaut scene was awesome! There were some really fun moments but the decisions that were made by Johnson were a killer to Episode 9\\, and the future of Star Wars movies. I really hope they reconsider giving the reins of the next trilogy to Rian Johnson. Unfortunately the surprising rave reviews will make any chance of him being replaced slim to none.","true":true}
