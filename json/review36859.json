Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was alright... It was beautiful visually but had so much failed potential. They failed to flesh out the story and elevate it. There were also so many plot holes which made the story feel poorly thought out. \\n\\nPros:\\n-Beautiful visual effects\\n-Beautiful framing\\, graphics\\, lighting\\, and art direction\\n-Acting was good\\n-Musical score was amazing\\n-Jokes were good\\n\\nCons:\\n-Character development was poorly done on screen \\n-Conflict was not taken seriously making certain scenes completely pointless\\n-Some scenes could have been focused on more but instead were merely glossed over\\n-Feels like there's more filler content \\n- The pacing was really bad. As in seriously bad. :\/ They focused on scenes that could be completely be cut from the film without hurting the story. \\n-They failed to fully establish or even respect the lore of the world. \\n-Too many Deus Ex Machina moves\\n-Felt like a Marvel film not a Star Wars film...\\n- The plot holes were so bad they could not go unnoticed","true":true}
