Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney would have been better off making a story about Knights of the Old Republic. The Knights of the Old Republic CGI mini movie on Youtube\\, is only 15 minutes long and it is by far more intriguing than this terrible mess. If I wanted an agenda smeared in my face\\, I will go watch the news. If I wanted to watch crappy acting and terrible dialogue\\, I will watch a house of commons debate.","true":true}
