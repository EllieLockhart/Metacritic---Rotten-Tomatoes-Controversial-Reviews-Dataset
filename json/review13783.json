Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i found myself rooting for kylo because the original characters look like they just showed up for the paycheck and i just dont like Ray and Finn they are just boring and dont have any connection to the originals SPOILER they shouldn't have killed snoke they should have had kylo switch sides\\, save Rey from snoke injuring him in the process then escaping together with some back to back sword fighting\\, that coould have left the story open for a han and lea kind of thing with ray and now ben solo as she helps him fight the darkside he could have been the next luke his backstory is almost perfectly set up for it and would have lead to some great sequels","true":true}
