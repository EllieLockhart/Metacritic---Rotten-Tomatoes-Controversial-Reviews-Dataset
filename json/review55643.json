Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not what I expected... perhaps expectations were too high but at least I was hoping not to be bored which I was for better part of the movie. Most of the character had expected developments but the old canon was disastrous to say the least. No idea how this is going to continue\\, but Im no longer interested. Im grateful that I did not spend money on this otherwise I'd be thoroughly crossed. CGI amazing\\, space battle was entertaining at the beginning but then things just went stagnant and boring; Im sorry to say that boring is a word that constantly repeats itself through the movie. Last half and hour WAS the actual movie\\, the rest was just fodder.","true":true}
