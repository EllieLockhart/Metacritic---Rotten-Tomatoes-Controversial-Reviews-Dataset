Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a perfect film\\, but a surprising spectacle to say the least. There are many things wrong with it with plot holes and poor writing taking the cake\\, but that doesn't make the good parts any less epic or enjoyable. Instead of seeing a rehash of Episode V -- having seen a \\\"remake\\\" of Episode IV with Episode VII -- we have a fresh story that suffers from the bad case of the hiccups.","true":true}
