Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Clocking in at just over two and a half hours\\, this offering of the storied series feels needlessly bloated. A lot of superfluous  sprawling side quests that derail the important main story. There were inexplicable happenings that left me scratching my head (no spoilers). A few of the new characters were whimsical and fun\\, and others seemed like sketches. The actors did a tremendous job with the material they got\\, and the film LOOKED and SOUNDED great. It sneaks into the top 5 of star wars movies ahead of all the prequels\\, but behind the original trilogy and force awakens.","true":true}
