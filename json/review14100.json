Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If your reading this review and want to see the movie\\, don\u2019t. I would have rated this movie zero stars\\, but you can\u2019t do that.... I\u2019m so disappointed with what they turned this life changing franchise into. They broke every rule that Star Wars has ever had\\, if Yoda can\u2019t fly through space then neither can Princess Leia. They made Luke look like a jerk and I hated how they made him look so dark when they showed the flashback of him almost killing Kylo. The jokes were corny and unoriginal. Also\\, I don\u2019t know what the heck they were doing with Luke\u2019s hologram thing but it was stupid. I am truly disappointed....they broke my dads heart","true":true}
