If I could change something about this game what would I do different? Only 3 things came to my mind. 1. Less abby playtime2. A different ending3. More JoelI felt like playing as abby was becoming some sort of chore. \u201cI have to do this in order to get to Ellie again\u201d kinda thing. But this part also had a good side and for me that was Lev. I love to see representation and we got to know more about the seraphites which was something I was genuinely curious about.Then ending doesn\u2019t sit right. If I was to choose I would rather it end at the barn with Dina and Ellie being happy together. The trip to california to get abby was kinda extra. Nothing was even accomplished just more deaths\\, Ellie losing 2 fingers and an upset Dina. Joel meant a lot to me. Especially as someone who considered him a father figure. The way he died didn\u2019t so him justice.Now also mentions of things that could\u2019ve made the game a lot lighter at times such as Ellie talking about riley at the arcade. But when I look at the overall picture thinking about the entire game I can\u2019t help but love it. It might not actually be a 10\/10 but it\u2019s as close as something can get\u2026 Expand","true":true}
