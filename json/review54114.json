Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't understand how this film was made. Reading the high critical reviews which cannot highlight any actual pros to this movie and ignore critical plot holes or character association\\, along with its huge incongruence with the audience score suggest that Disney or at least Lucasfilm has paid a number of these critics in advance to artificially inflate the score. The only redeeming scenes were those of Carrie Fisher (may she rest in peace after how this movie disgracing her legacy)\\, and the shot with the boulders where Oscar Isaac's and John Boyega's character appear to hold hands. I speculate they did this after facing much resistance. As a fan\\, I would like a explanations and apologies from Kathleen Kennedy (who should be fired for allowing Johnson's racist attempts at white feminism and sexist\/misogynistic character assassination of Rey in this film\\, among other issues)\\, Rian Johnson (who should be stricken from pursuing a SW trilogy without even having a plot\\, much like this film)\\, Lucasfilm (how were these people ever approved)\\, and Disney. This movie should be retconned and refilmed posthaste\\, likely at the same time as Episode IX. I don't see any alternative frankly.","true":true}
