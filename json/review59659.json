The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game looks great and plays better than the last\\, adding a few innovations to combat\\, and graphical fidelity that can be utilized by other devs. In terms of looking good\\, and sounding good this game is a 10. Where it fails is in establishing a cohesive\\, rational story. Expect flash backs inside of flash backs. I believe this game was pulled down by one man's ego\\, the director's\\, an ego that was fulled by sycophants in the industry\\, who think that games are a product for people pretending to be 'high art' connoisseurs--instead of the average gamer. The director\\, Druckmann\\, has made it clear that he doesn't care about the average gamer\\, and has stated many times that he hopes that said people hate the game\\, and not to expect even a modicum of fun\\, and or light as was found in the first. What you get is a shallow\\, predictable\\, and cliche story about revenge. A story that feels so different from the first\\, that it feels like a sad parody. Characters will be behaviorally unrecognizable\\, the pacing is off\\, don't expect to see giraffe's walking through the sunlight\\, and other such moments. Bruce Straley's influence is gone\\, and without anyone to balance him out\\, Druckmann's whims are on full display.\r\rWhat you get is a nihilistic\\, petulant\\, incongruous mess\\, that seems to have been designed as an insult to core fans. You will feel this in how npcs\\, and by extension your intelligence is treated by a game that does everything in its power to tell you that an unrepentant psychopath is the way forward for this series. Not to mention the meta aspect\\, where Druckmann is doing everything in his power\\, to convince twitter\\, that his inflated ego (he would call it his 'substantial IQ') is the best way forward for a once revered gaming company. We're talking about a guy who calls an awkwardly misplaced sex scene in the back of a dirty van\\, 'tasteful'. And yes\\, that's also what you get in this game.\r\rTo summarize\\, The Last of Us Part II is so detached from what made the first game great\\, and lacking any respect for its past\\, fans will hardly recognize it. If you like pretentious\\, suffer porn\\, where you can set dogs on fire\\, this is the game for you.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
