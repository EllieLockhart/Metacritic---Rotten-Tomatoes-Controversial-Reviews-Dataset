Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Director was allowed to abandon key story arcs that defined the escence of Star Wars. Extremely disappointed that fundamental expectations for the saga were deliberately ignored or even reversed. I understand why critics love to praise and even reward breaking the mold\\, but the approach to this particular film makes a mockery of of those things that were endearing to Star Wars. Its unfortunate that hard-core fans would shun the new Solo movie in retaliation\\, especially when Ron Howard did such a decent job. Hey Disney\\, take a hard look at Rogue One. It worked.","true":true}
