Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible pacing\\, bad script\\, plot holes galore. Characters weren't developed\\, some were killed off way too early\\, forced comedy that ruined the immersion\\, a horrible scene with Leia that was so awkward it made me physically uncomfortable. Poe is more relevant than either Finn or Rey\\, Luke's character is assassinated\\, Rey becomes even more of a Mary Sue\\, Snoke is the epitome of a question mark.\\n\\nThis movie isn't even good as a stand alone action flick because of the glaring plot holes-as a SW movie it's just pitiful. They need to give Adam Driver more compelling lines instead of having him just smash stuff and yell\\, he's a great actor but he's wasted in this movie with the horrible script. I wish JJ Abrams had directed this-TFA was at least decent. This didn't feel like a SW movie at its best\\, and was just bad all around at its worst.","true":true}
