Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For all those people who gave this movie 1 star or a 1\/2 star\\, what would you give Episode 1? The Last Jedi was very entertaining and well made. I thought the story jumped a little quickly at times during key moments\\, but overall I'm very impressed with the quality of the film. I'm looking forward to next year's Han Solo movie.","true":true}
