Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is the best Star Wars film since Empire Strikes Back.  The film took bold risks and introduced unique ideas and concepts to break the mold\\, while still feeling like a Star Wars film true to heart. The way the film sent Luke off couldn't have been any more perfect\\, and his character arc was the best right next to Rey's and Kylo Ren's.  Finn and Poe were given more depth and development as characters\\, and newcomers Rose and Haldo did an excellent job in brining unique perspectives to the events of the story. While Leia had an opportunity to be sent off in a beautiful way\\, and the casino scene could have been handled better\\, the film managed to shine with its themes of learning from failure\\, and moving forward by growing from it. Snoke was given the same treatment that Sidious was given without any backstory until the prequels. Rey was also handled wonderfully and better than in force awakens by having her learn and train more\\, and deal with the fact that she couldn't turn Ben. It would have been interesting if she did in fact joined him\\, but I am still pleased with the results of the story. \\nThe so called \\\"fans\\\" who are hating this have no idea what they are talking about\\, nor are they open minded enough to embrace new ideas.","true":true}
