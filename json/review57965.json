Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When I first saw it on Thursday I did not have an immediate opinion. The wait\\, hype\\, perceptions\\, expectations\\, speculations and finally realization that   I had to absorb it all and find a place for this. \\nRian Johnson crafted a very different Star Wars film that is familiar but very much his (a Rian Johnson film).  Empire strikes back always felt and looked different\\, stood out and rose to the top of my list and has always been there\\, the force awakens came pretty close but the Last Jedi is now up there. I saw it with my wife again this morning and it started coming together. When it was done I can truly say I do not know where we are going with this story. I'm excited to have JJ back to do his magic and bring it all home with wrapping the whole saga up. \\nIt has been a beautiful journey and I'm blessed to have grown up with it and can share with my children","true":true}
