We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Graphics: what you would expect for this game and from these devs\\, nice. Gameplay: nearly the EXACT same as Tlou1\\, nothing special\\, but ok. Story. The Story. Yea. Maneater`s story vs The last of us 2 Story. Both have a female lead\\, both have a revenge plot\\, but 1 game needed 7 years and the first part as advertisement\\, while the other one came pretty much out of nowhere and does everything better\\, story wise\\, for less money. Tlou2 makes you play for over 10 hours as Abby\\, the female with an unrealistic body (she is supposed to have trained during 4 years in the apocalypse with low quality food\\, and i was thinking these devs know a bit biology after the first game\\, hence the nickname \\\"Shehulk\\\"). The \\\"romance\\\" is no romance and just a disappointing side plot\\, the cast gets killed without any grace or even a funeral. Its a \\\"walk around and fight 4-5 enemys every 20 minutes\\\" game with unlikable characters. Ellie however seems to simply get a stroke at the end of the game\\, making every death in the entire game pointless\\, but they all where already pointless\\, since Abby has a split personality\\, since she claims to NOT brutally murder those who SAVED HER LIVE. If you dont care about anything or dont understand what continuity is\\, like the writers\\, this game will be good for you.\r\rThis game pissed people of big time\\, duo to false advertising and now\\, the manipulation of the review score. Weird that multiple thousands of reviews came in\\, after naughtydog had some conversations with people. This game is not bad by any means\\, but it doesnt deserve to be tlou2\\, since it didnt ad anything to the world and only took precious things\\, like the will to live for Ellie\\, i guess.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
