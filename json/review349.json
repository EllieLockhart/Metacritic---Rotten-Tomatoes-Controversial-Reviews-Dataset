Yes it is very cliche in many instances but let's be honest\\, we already knew that about the game. Where i was most surprised was how good the story was. The way you learn about and essentially build the characters based on your actions was very well done. This game has many jump scares\\, funny dialogue\\, and just downright predictable moments. Having said that\\, the music score\\, environments\\, and overall atmosphere the story creates is wonderful. Visually\\, this game gorgeous and truly adds to the overall experience. Perhaps a really cool feature about this game is how they implemented the Dual-Shock controller for certain things. If you enjoy horror movies\\, B-horror\\, comedy\\, suspense\\, drama\\, and some twists in a good story\\, give this game a tray. I truly think it is very enjoyable and fun all the while scaring you at random times. Very well done and possibly the best sleeper hit in the past 6 months.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
