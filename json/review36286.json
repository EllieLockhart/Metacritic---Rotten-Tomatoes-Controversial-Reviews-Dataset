Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The location scenes are awesome\\, worthy of the best Star Wars movies. BUT: Mark Hamill\/Luke comes across as immature and petulant in his old age as he did in his younger years...rather than the wise mentor he had apparently become. (If he matured into a wise mentor\\, he seemed to have regressed spectacularly which is just darn unlikely.)  Some big editing gaps leave you confused about how one can be stranded in enemy territory in one moment\\, then safely cruising on a spaceship in the next....just dumb mistakes that should have been fixed before they called it done.","true":true}
