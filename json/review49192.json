Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"worst star wars movie ever. Such disrespect to Luke Skywalker making him weak and to die weak.  He was a hero and a great Jedi master. if they wanted him to die then it should of been in Star Wars IV and die a hero. The movie dragged on and had frivolous parts. The only exciting part of the movie was when Kylo Ren killed Snoke. Also the movie tried to give hints of Rey's parents but still kept us in the dark.  Seeing the first Stars Wars in 1977 and been a fan ever since\\, I was disappointed with this installment. I'm hoping IV will make a come back. But such a dishonor to Luke Skywalker.","true":true}
