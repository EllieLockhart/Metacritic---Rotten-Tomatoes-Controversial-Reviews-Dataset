Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst starwars movie \\, a very bad script with to many character that were pointless\\,  Also not build on characters from the TFA for example no back story for snoke or the knight o ren that seem to be written out and also a lot of starwars science was change for example smokes lightning grounding its before striking it target or that Rey has unbelievably force powers she has never trained for & last for me the humour in the film its self was on a childish level that really rounded off a poor movie ! \\\"I am not going even go in to the poor writting for both Khloe or Luke!\\\"","true":true}
