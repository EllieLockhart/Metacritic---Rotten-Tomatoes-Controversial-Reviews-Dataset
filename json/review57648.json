Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To say I was disappointed in this movies is a gross understatement.  As well as Disney has done with its own content and Marvel\\, their take on Star Wars has been terrible (Although Rouge One was great).  Force Awakens was nothing more than a terrible remake of A New Hope\\, and this movie lacks any discernible resemblance to a Star Wars movie at all.  This two and a half hours of torture was filled with one liner after one liner\\, too many characters with no development\\, and an overabundance of stories that either served no purpose or had no climax.  Past characters have been added for nothing more than nostalgic content to get previous fans in the theaters\\, ruining these characters in the process. Additionally\\, the jokes and cute creatures that Disney plans to market make this an unbearable children's movie for adults. \\n\\n\\n\\n***Possible spoilers below****\\n\\n\\nRemember all of those questions you wanted answered from Force Awakens?  Prepare to be disappointed.  This writer has decided to ignore past content and basically give fans a big slap in the face.   \\n\\nAt least the movie had amazing special effects and an epic light saber battle!  Oh wait\\, no it didn't.  At least it had some great acting!  Oh wait\\, no it didn't.  At least it had a 40 minute unnecessary trip to a casino to rescue some horses. Oh wait...no that one is real.\\n\\n\\n***End possible spoilers***\\n\\n\\nThe Last Jedi resembled much of Star Wars recent literature in that it is just a bunch of ideas thrown together without any direction\\, flow\\, or purpose. I can't comprehend why this movie was made up of nothing more than 20 or so pointless side stories. Maybe\\, like a dog spotting a new squirrel\\, Disney thinks the younger generation can't follow a single story without getting bored?  With content out there like Game of Thrones\\, this poor story development is unacceptable.\\n\\nAs much as fans hated the prequels\\, they should be missing George Lucas now.  Behind the bad CGI characters\\, political themes\\, and midichlorians\\, he was at least able to orchestrate an entertaining story.","true":true}
