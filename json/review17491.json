Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I see Rotten Tomatoes is perfectly okay with fake giving this \\\"movie\\\" inflated scores. C'mon\\, five star in a row from 14 fake accounts as a coordinated \\\"effort\\\"? Those moronic sjws are not even trying hard enough to enforce their point of view on the reasonable ones. This \\\"movie\\\" sucks from all possible angles and so does the disease called political correctness that has been steadily feeding of star wars for the last 3 years. By the way I established a second account to prove how worthless are all the unsubstantiated all 5-star scores are (\\\"Finally\\, a Star Wars film with a brain!!!\\\" - who tf with a reasonable mind writes such a travesty?!). Don't let the disease spread by ruin johnson kill star wars. If they can overstate the value of this \\\"movie\\\" and claim to have a moral highground\\, so can we.","true":true}
