Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Is it different? Yes\\, but a great movie none the less. I have been a fan since 77\\, enjoy the fresh take Johnson has with the franchise. Love Mark Hamill\u2019s performance. Need to see it 2 or 3 times to take it all in and process. May the Force be with you always.","true":true}
