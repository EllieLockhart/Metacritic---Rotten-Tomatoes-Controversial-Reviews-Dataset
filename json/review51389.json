Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute waste of time.\\nTruly disappointed in the movie. Force Awakens got me hyped up\\, just to be lead astray to the unbelievably political and disgusting movie that followed. I have been watching Star Wars for a long time and every Star Wars movie left a satisfying feeling after escaping to a galaxy far far away...except this one. I just wanted it to be over.","true":true}
