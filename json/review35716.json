Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a very hard pill to swallow. Rian Johnson has some very strange ideas about most of the long-standing ideas Star Wars has been known for. This translates into a strange viewing experience\\, especially on the first time around. I very much appreciate Rian's dedication to breaking the mold and switching things up. This is unlike any Star Wars film ever released - which is why Audience scores are so mediocore - but I ask you to trust me: The Last Jedi is a Star Wars film that is unexpected at almost every turn. Your first viewing is going to feel incredibly strange\\, but it was a necessary step for the franchise to keep it from falling into a pit of repetitive nonsense that we have already seen multiple times via the franchise. If you are unsure your first time\\, give it a second chance - it deserves the high critic reviews.","true":true}
