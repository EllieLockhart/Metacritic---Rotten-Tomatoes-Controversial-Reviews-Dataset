Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think the movie did what it was meant to accomplish. I know people aren't happy with how it ended for Luke but his purpose was served and made Rey a Jedi in the force. The only concern\/more like interest is to see how they decide what to do with Leia's character. It is deeply saddening about Carrie Fisher and they have to give respect to her and the character. After this last movie I would like to know how they originally wanted to go with Leia and the movie.","true":true}
