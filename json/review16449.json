Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm speechless and shocked about all those good reviews on The Last Jedi. I feel like people here got paid for writing those good reviews. I went into this movie thinking it will be one of the best Star Wars movies ever but I went home disappointed. It was too long\\, boring and didn't make sense at all. Luke Skywalker's part in it was like they were forced to make it good but it sucked so hard. At this point\\, I'm sorry Mark. Finn's story just sucked\\, too. He went from being so important to not important at all. I don't even know what to write because everything about this movie was awful. Except the scenes with the Porgs\\, I guess. That was the best part about it. I'm so sad and don't know if I even want to watch the next Star Wars movies. I started to watch these movies with my dad when I was a little kid and I just love them all but today made me realize that there will be no Star Wars worth watching anymore. I'm so sad and I honestly feel bad about the actors. I don't understand how J.J. Abrams could approve this movie.","true":true}
