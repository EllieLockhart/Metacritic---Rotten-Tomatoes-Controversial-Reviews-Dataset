Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It Completely destroys all the rules\\, logic\\, and lore of the previous movies for cheap comedy and interesting visuals\\, characters are extremely shallow\\, plot is internally inconsistent.  Anytime actual suspense is achieved they defuse it with pissant sight gags or slapstick. \\nAsian Lady is as useless and unlikable as Rey is perfect. \\nMoral of the Holdo arc is that you should blindly bow to all authority. \\nEditing is jumpy and disjointed\\, reaction takes are Often misaligned.\\nBut the CGI and practical effects do blend well and the score is great.","true":true}
