Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Excellent character arcs\\, which set up our heroes for their final battle in Epi. IX. Fun modern\\, meta humor. Epic battle scenes and lightsaber fights. A truly heart-wrenching family drama. Excellent themes. It's a unique movie in a franchise that struggled to make it's mark in the Star Wars world since the end of The Return of the Jedi. My favorite part? The fact that everyone's terrible speculations were wrong. Rian and his crew did right by this film 10x over\\, cleaning out fans stuck in the past and making way for a new generation of Star Wars fans (a generation that'll include me and my children).","true":true}
