Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went in with a lot of expectations as to what was going to happen and what each character would do. I've never been happier to be completely wrong. I loved all of this film except the storyline with Finn and Rose. If you need to run to the restroom during the film\\, do it when those two are on screen. You won't miss anything","true":true}
