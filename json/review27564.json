Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall the movie has some issues. I don't like how the OT Characters were treated. I didn't have a problem with the overall vision\\, but I think it was executed poorly. I think there was some great moments\\, and some really cringe worthy moments. I've seen it twice\\, and I'll buy the DVD\\, but now my hope for Star Wars is with Solo and the next installment of this trilogy.","true":true}
