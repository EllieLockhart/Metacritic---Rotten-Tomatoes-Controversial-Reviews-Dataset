Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its garbage\\, and I really tried hard to hide my passionate Star Wars fan self from being biased\\, but everything about this movie is garbage\\, the Mary Sue is no more\\, she is a Rey a Mary Sue turned up to 11\\, what have you done to Luke? NO STOP\\, I almost don't mind the agenda pushing in this movie\\, its tasteless but not a deal breaker for me\\, but the boring side stories the boring main \\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"plot\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\, have these people ever heard of continuity?  So this is after Death Star but bigger 3.0 is destroyed and there is no Resistan.... oh sorry Rebels again left? Bullshit \\nI had my issues\\, big ones with the prequels\\, but I think this movie made me love them\\, at least those feels like star wars movies.  This\\, feels like a stupid tv show that stole shit from star wars","true":true}
