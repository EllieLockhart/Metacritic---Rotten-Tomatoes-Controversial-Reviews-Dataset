Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*no spoilers*\\nso much fun in one movie!\\nit's the kind of movie that you can see it in 12:00 PM and in the moment the movie is end you are not so tierd and the movie is 2.5 hours.\\nthe movie dont stop for a one small moment!\\nand this is bad to me becouse sometimes you need to get to the toilet but if you you do that you kind of get out from the movie you feel like you dont see 1 hour of the movie even if you gte out to 1 minute\\, because it i give the movie 4.5 stars and not 5 stars.\\nbut this is kind of the movies that in the end you get out with your bigest smile ever and say \\\"wow\\\".\\nbut the movie has one problam dear Carrie Fisher(princess leia) is die and in the movie princess leia don't die\\, and I don't wanna to see Carrie Fisher in CGI you know we need to respect her die.\\nso guys i recommened this movie for all ages no blood no horror just fun always fun! 4.5 stars!","true":true}
