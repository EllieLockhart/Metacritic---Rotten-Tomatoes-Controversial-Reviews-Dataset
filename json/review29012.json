Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really enjoy this installment of Star Wars. Liked a couple of the twists\\, and did not see them coming. The movie itself holds up even with an underwhelming performance by Mark Hamill and somewhat lengthy battle scenes.","true":true}
