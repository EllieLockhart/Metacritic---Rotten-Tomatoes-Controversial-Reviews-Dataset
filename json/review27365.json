Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Other than a few disappointing moments like the quick end of Snoke\\, Luke\u2019s vanishing act and Leia flying through space I get the movie was well done and deserves better marks than most users are giving it. I know it\u2019s impossible to please a true Star Wars fan. ","true":true}
