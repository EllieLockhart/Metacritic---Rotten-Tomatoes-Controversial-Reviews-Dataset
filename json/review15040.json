Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I laughed and cried. This movie surprised me in every way. It wasn't what I hoped it would be. It was better. And cheers to letting the gals have a turn in the driver's seat. I'm sure that is the reason this film is 1\/2 stars from the trolls.","true":true}
