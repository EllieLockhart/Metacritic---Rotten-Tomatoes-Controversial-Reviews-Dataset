Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. \\nI don't understand the miserable\\, snobby reviews. But then\\, I'm from the team that just went to the movies to have an enjoyable\\, fun few hours of escapism\\, not to politically\\, cynically analyze every teeny tiny crumb. \\nWatch it. Make up your own mind. I promise\\, it's worth it.","true":true}
