Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I guess some people just don't know what to think until they come online to see how everyone else thinks.\\n\\nEveryone coming out of theater last night: \\\"Man\\, that was awesome.\\\"\\n\\nSame people after coming online today to read reviews: \\\"Yeah\\, that movie was garbage!\\\"\\n\\nI have as much \\\"Star Wars\\\" cred as anyone else here\\, and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I liked the development of the returning characters\\, I thought the movie was exciting and fun\\, several scenes elicited an emotional response\\, and perhaps most telling is that I can't wait to see it again and especially can't wait to find out what happens in Episode IV.\\n\\nThere are a couple items that pull it from 5-stars for me. I felt that parts of it were too fast paced\\, as there was very little time to just breath and enjoy the scenery. The action scenes were obviously fine with the pacing\\, but that carried over into the other scenes too much\\, either making them faster paced than they needed to be\\, or just shortening the scene.\\n\\nMy next main complaint\\, and really not necessarily a knock on the movie's stand-alone quality\\, is that I am not sure where they go from here. I like Kylo and the development they gave him during this movie\\, but I'm not sure how they are going to handle him being the prime antagonist for the next and final movie of the trilogy. But hey\\, if they pull it off in the next movie\\, I'll be impressed.","true":true}
