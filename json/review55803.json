Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plenty of twists and turns. The star wars world has been opened up. Not everything is perfect but it is engaging\\, exciting\\, beautiful to look at and a lot of fun with some very good character development. Definitely a film to watch more than once...there is a lot to think about!","true":true}
