Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How this movie is so well received by critics is beyond me.  Rian Johnson obviously has no appreciation for what has gone before and wanted to be \\\"edgy\\\" and \\\"different\\\" and subvert what we had come to know and love from previous Star Wars movies. The characters act in unbelievable ways - including most famously destroying the idol of our childhood\\, Luke Skywalker. You want to make a point that heroes are fallible? Fine. Make your own movie unrelated to what has gone on before\\, don't completely derail the narrative arc established by others. Others have pointed out the massive plot holes.  Yes\\, a certain suspension of disbelief s necessary for a Star Wars movies\\, but this movie asks us to completely check our common sense at the door and ignore the \\\"rules\\\" that have been established in this universe. This is the first Star Wars movie that I watched once and will never watch again. Indeed\\, I only saw \\\"The Rise of Skywalker\\\" because I had heard it rejected much of this movie.","true":true}
