Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Enjoyable movie that can be watched and enjoyed on its' own. As a Star Wars movie it has some controversy\\, but I loved the themes and risks taken by Rian Johnson. Love Rose\\, hope she's given more to do in the future. One of my favorite Star War movies and can't wait to see it for the third time next week.","true":true}
