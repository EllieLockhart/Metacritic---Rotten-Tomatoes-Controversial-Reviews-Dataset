Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I big letdown and disappointment. A life long Star Wars fan that treated all the previous Star Wars movies as equals\\, The Last Jedi did not live up to the expectations. 2 hours and 34 minutes of watching the franchise sink. They should just rename it Star Wars: Titanic 2","true":true}
