Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is like seeing a train wreck in slow motion. If any one was looking for a cientific fact of the existence of evil it is the scrip of this movie. There was just one word that I repeat during the movie.... Why why why?","true":true}
