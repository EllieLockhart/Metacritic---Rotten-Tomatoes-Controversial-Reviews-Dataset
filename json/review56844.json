Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are some spectacular moments that take your breath away.  Sadly\\, in most cases the emotional gravity that accompanies these events ends up weightless with a quick if not silly turn about\\, robbing the audience of some truly meaningful moments.  If it's not a bird\\, plane\\, or Leia snapping the viewers back to reality\\, it is the distraction of (younger) Luke's mid-life crisis.  While the newcomers to the saga may not have noticed Luke sporting his \\\"Just For Men\\\"  hair color\\, everyone else did.  It is amazing how something so simple\\, yet obvious disrupts one's immersion.  On a larger scale\\, the overall story arch was original\\, even if it wasn't what everyone hoped for.  The biggest large scale problems revolved around under developed\/wasted characters.  It would have been better to extend the movie length to accommodate everything TLJ tries to encompass or narrowed the focus of the film and spend more time on character development.","true":true}
