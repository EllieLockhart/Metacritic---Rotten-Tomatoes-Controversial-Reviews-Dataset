Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While there are many opinions on the film\\, I personally LOVE it. Great acting (especially Hamill and Driver) beautiful visuals\\, engrossing cinematography\\, and a well crafted script (despite Canto Bight) from Rian Johnson help the film stand out among the other Star Wars films and shows a new way foreword in the franchise\\, giving us fitting ends to Luke and Leia so we can usher in a new era for the final film. In the end the film accomplishes what it sets out to do\\, and I will gladly say I respect it as much as the originals.","true":true}
