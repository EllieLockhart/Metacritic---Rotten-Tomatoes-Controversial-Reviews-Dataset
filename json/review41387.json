Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is an absolute dumpster fire. Bad writing\\, terrible plot holes\\, under developed boring characters\\, and saga destroying scenes that affect the entire franchise\\, ie. light speed weapons (think of that next time you watch the trench run). The movie is also terribly unoriginal\\, a complete ripoff of Jedi and Empire. The best way to sum up where we are now quickly is a quote I found by Mr. Plinket.\\n\\n\\\"Your beloved favorite characters\\, who you thought beat the bad guys and lived happily ever after\\, were actually failures who spent their entire lives fighting a horrifying\\, generations long\\, losing war that took away everything they ever loved and eventually killed them\\, but not before passing the horror on to a new cursed generation\\, because these toys aren't gonna sell themselves!\\\"","true":true}
