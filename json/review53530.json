Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Entertaining\\, to a degree; if\\, you had never seen another Star Wars movie in your entire life. The character development that started in The Force Awakens was brutally dismantled and by the end of the film I had no idea what the story arcs were and those that were clear were weakly motivated at best. Rian Johnson\\, Disney and others have\\, in my opinion\\, stamped out the flame that made Star Wars special. SPOILER follows...The story that was started in Ep 7 (and honestly\\, I was not a huge fan of it but was willing to stay with the story) fell flat on its a** in this film. First\\, the new characters of Rey\\, Finn and Kylo Ren are the weakest heroes in the canon to date. Rey has no clear motivation throughout the film\\, only how badly she wants Luke to train her and then she seems so easily seduced by Ren and the darkside. Finn does absolutely nothing by the end of the film and his plot actually goes nowhere and fails. Kylo is still whiny and disturbed and kills his master\\, Snoke\\, leaving us with a huge WTF? Who was Snoke anyway\\, oh well he's dead now\\, moving on. Then there's Luke who is far from the hero he was\\, naturally mind you in the original series. He has no interest in saving the rebels\\, despite the fact that he was a rebel leader. He attempted to kill Kylo because of his dark tendencies when he was still a young boy but fought for years to redeem his father who had tried to kill him on numerous occasions. Chewie also does nothing in the film. Disney is clearly trying to dismantle the old regime by killing off all of our heroes in a very George. R.R. Martin-esque fashion so they can install their own Disney safe\\, tested and Kennedy stamped collection of dolls and backpacks aimed at 7 year old girls. The prequels received a lot of flak but they were visionary nonetheless\\, original stories with well developed plots and natural political progressions and conflicts. At the end of this film I'm wondering so many things such as why did the republic fall? Who is the First Order and how were they allowed to come to power? And why were these magnificent heroes so stupid and lame that they betrayed their instincts and let the galaxy fall flat on its arse.  See it in memory of your childhood.","true":true}
