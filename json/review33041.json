Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Stunning disappointment.  There are some beautifully shot visuals\\, but the story did not feel like Star Wars.  Too many cringey moments.  The movie beats you about the head and shoulders with the main theme (failure).  \\n\\nFirst time I've ever walked out of a Star Wars movie feeling bummed out.","true":true}
