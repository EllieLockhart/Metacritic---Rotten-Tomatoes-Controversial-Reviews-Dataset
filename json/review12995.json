Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't demand complete accuracy in my science fiction\\, let alone Star Wars\\, but parts of this movie really seemed like they were just testing to see how far they could go.\\n\\nThe movie seems like it really wants to subvert your expectations\\, but it doesn't.  It just makes really poor decisions\\, plot-wise\\, repeatedly.  \\n\\nYeah\\, I didn't expect some of the things that happened in the movie\\, but not because they were surprising.  I didn't expect them because they were kind of bad\\, and I expected something less bad.","true":true}
