The reason people loved The Last of Us was because of the storytelling and characters. This game spits on what the fans loved about the original and then rubs it in.

The reason people loved The Last of Us was because of the storytelling and characters. This game spits on what the fans loved about the original and then rubs it in. It hurts to see these characters handled so poorly and I can only compare the writing to the abysmal Star Wars sequel trilogy. The story is so long and tedious and filled with illogical choices. It's hard to find motivation to even play this game.\r\rAnybody who liked The Last Of Us or anybody who values good writing should avoid this game at all costs. Most people buy Naughty Dog games for an amazing and fun adventure; this game is neither fun nor amazing.\r\rThis garbage isn't worth your time.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
