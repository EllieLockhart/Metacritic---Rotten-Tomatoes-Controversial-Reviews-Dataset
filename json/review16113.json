Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I may be in a minority\\, but I appreciated most of the chances taken by this film. Chances were absolutely necessary to be able to break open new possibilities and fresh stories. Like any fan there was much that left me wanting\\, some disappointing\\, and many surprises but I still think that this film is very good.","true":true}
