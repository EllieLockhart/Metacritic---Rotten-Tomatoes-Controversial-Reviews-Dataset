Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a rotten movie! Hated what Rian and Kathleen did to Luke Skywalker especially after Mark Hamill objected to basically everything Rian envisioned for his character. A good writer\/director would actually have respected Mr. Hamill's feedback as being the best qualified of anyone - especially since Mr. Hamill has been defined by this role since for 40 years.\\n\\n The utter lack of respect for the massive fan base is astounding - I can't believe Disney actually released this garbage. I told all my friends and family - after I read what happened between Mr. Hamill and Ryan - that \\\"I have a bad feeling about this\\\". The disparity between reviews from the critics at 92% and the fan base now at 54% isn't normal either\\, and smacks of biased movie critics.\\n\\nI could go on and on\\, but frankly the movie isn't worth another moment of thought - time to move on to something better to spend my money on. I know what I WON'T be spending it on until they fire Rian and Kathleen for hiring him for 3 more movies - I wont be spending on anything Star Wars or Disney.","true":true}
