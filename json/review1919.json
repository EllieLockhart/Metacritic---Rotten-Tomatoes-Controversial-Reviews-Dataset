Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As just another movie I would give TLJ probably a four star rating; however\\,  as a star wars movie I believe the rating of 2.5 is generous because the movie failed to meet expectations. It had a lot of potential and great ideas but just didn't follow through. At least not how many star wars fans thought it would. It's reminiscent of a first draft hastily created and turned in without revision. The ideas were good but the presentation was not. It lacked the development and sophistication that makes Star Wars  the movies we love. I think Rian Johnson would have done much better had he revised and rewritten more. As the movie is now\\, it does not have a natural flow and is very choppy in my opinion. The comedy seems forced and unnatural and\/or badly timed. Overall\\, i enjoyed the movie but was just disappointed because it was not the movie I hoped it would be. I did not leave the theater raving about how good it was or with a feeling of excitement for the next episode.","true":true}
