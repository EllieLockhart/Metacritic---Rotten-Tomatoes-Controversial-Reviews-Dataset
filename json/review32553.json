Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi furthers the stories of new and classic characters while taking bold new turns . Great acting\\, incredible action\\, fantastic effects\\, and shocking twists and turns along the way that will surprise everyone. A triumphant addition to the Star Wars saga. Impressive... Most impressive.","true":true}
