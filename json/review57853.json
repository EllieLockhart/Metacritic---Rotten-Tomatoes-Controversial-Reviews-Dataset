{"101487":194331,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-10-12","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"We are the spark\\, that will light the fire\\, that will burn the First Order down\\\" \\n Love that quote.\\n\\n So The Last Jedi is the sequel to The Force Awakens and picks up right where it left off.\\n \\n Now overall\\, I did really like this movie. But yeah it definitely has some problems. First of all\\, we learn nothing about Snoke (Though to be fair\\, it's about as much as we knew about Sidious in the OT)\\, and all that's said about (presumably The Knights of Ren) is that they were students that Kylo Ren took with him when he joined Snoke. None of the other members make appearances\\, and Finn and Rose's arc felt kind of unneeded\\, which sucks to admit\\, cause I loved Finn in TFA\\, but everything at that Casino and with Benicio Del Toro's character just wasted time and went nowhere (Could have saved time\\, and a pointless character by making Rose the hacker\\, as I heard one reviewer suggest). Plus it felt like Laura Dern's character was being a b!tch for the sake of being a b!tch. Could have saved some pointless conflict by letting Poe in on the plan. \\n\\n Now on with the good\\, despite some hick-ups\\, the plot overall was great\\, got a lot of tension there\\, the action scenes were awesome. Especially this one with Rey and Kylo Ren\\, don't wanna say too much\\, but omg it was awesome. \\n\\n The actors were all great\\, but the ones I really wanna point out are Daisy Ridley\\, Adam Driver\\, and Mark Hamil\\n\\n  So Rey's got the force\\, but what does she do with it? She's a girl trying to find her place in the world (galaxy more like) and she feels Luke Skywalker's the one to help her find it. \\n\\n Kylo Ren is out to prove something\\, he's out to prove he's more then just a Darth Vader wannabe\\, when he smashes his mask (Which disappointed me a little bit cause I loved that thing)\\, to stop trying to be like Vader and be his own man. I also loved how we learned the real reason he turned to the dark side. It gives the character some more sympathy\\, and you feel sorry for him. \\n\\n But the best was Mark Hamill as Luke. I LOVED this portrayal of Luke Skywalker. He isn't the same idealistic young man we last saw in Return of The Jedi. He's become a cynical and grouchy old man. But you understand why. He unintentionally turns his own nephew\\, into his worst nightmare\\, basically creating another Darth Vader\\, he just doesn't see the point. Then Rey comes along. and he finds himself helping her. \\n\\n Overall it's a flawed movie\\, but a good one. Hope Episode IX ends the sequel trilogy on a high note. \\n\\n On a side note. Rest in peace Carrie Fisher","true":true}
