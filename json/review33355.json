Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SW8 was very good\\, I'd even argue excellent. Multiple layers of mythos that conclude the story beyond my satisfaction. I get that Mark Hammil wasn't happy at all with this final rendition of Luke Skywalker. But this story ain't gospel folks- midlife is a bitch and Luke gave up. Happens sometimes. We are just lucky Luke decided to join the fight eventually.and do his part to buy time for Rey to save the day and help the residence survive. Everyone that's unhappy with this movie needs to finally grow up and realise that... STAR WARS HAS GROWN UP AND MOVED OUT OF THE HOUSE! New generation advances the story folks\\, and that's how life works. 1977-2017 is 40 years after all!","true":true}
