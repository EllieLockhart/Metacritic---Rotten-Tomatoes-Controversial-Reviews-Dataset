Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everything I needed it to be. Rian Johnson did a great job staying true to and building on the legacy of Star Wars. This movie has all the emotions and epic action of a true big space opera while never being heavy handed or taking itself too seriously. It was an asbolute joy to watch and puts the Star Wars brand in VERY good hands for the future.","true":true}
