Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For me this was one of the greatest Star Wars films because it told a more human start then some of the others in the past. Each character was challenged in some way and we were able to see that these character make mistakes too and they are not these flawless unattainable beings that people might've pinned them up to be in the past. I believe that this movie was extremely well thought out and that every scene served a purpose when telling these character's stories  I've seen some people complain about the humor of this movie but for me all of the humor either came from characterization or shock value. The humor didn't take away from the story at all it brought light to some darker moments that this story had","true":true}
