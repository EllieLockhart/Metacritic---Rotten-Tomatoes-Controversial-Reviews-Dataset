Let's start off with the pros. The graphics and scenery are amazing in this game. Everything looks extremely well polished and is just pure eye candy from the interactive environment to just the way everything literally just deserves an absolute bravo. The gameplay itself is much like the last of us one band hasn't changed all that much but I didn't feel that this was a downside due to the fact I liked the last of us one in the way that it felt and handled. I know that can be a bit tipsy because some people say it should run smoother or aiming should be better but overall I felt like it was just fine. I hate to admit it though but that storyline is awful. I tried so hard to like the story and tried to approach the game with an open mind but ultimately in the end it did nothing for me. If anything I walked away from the game feeling totally unsatisfied with the character development\\, general storyline\\, and not necessarily the events that took place but how the events took place in the game. There is just too many things that didn't make sense to me and overall I feel it was a bad decision for the developers to go this route. I get the whole concept of trying to do something new and edgy but there is a way to do it and I just felt like the developers missed the mark completely on really capturing the spirit and soul of not only the players but the characters that pulled the players into the game as well. The reason why I am giving it a low score is just because I was so enveloped and immersed in the story of the first one but absolutely felt nothing but frustration and no payoff in the end. I really understand that a story doesn't have to go my way and it honestly shouldn't it should be up to the directors and writers with however they see. But video games just like movies are here to entertain their audience and me personally I did not find any entertainment out of the story that I was hoping would really incite my inner emotions and leave me feeling like I played a masterpiece like The first game but unfortunately that feeling never came out. If you want to play this game then I wish you luck. If you did play this game and actually liked it for what it was and truly enjoyed it I'm not only happy for you but I am jealous of you. I can honestly say that there is no put way I will play this game again and it breaks my heart that it went this way.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
