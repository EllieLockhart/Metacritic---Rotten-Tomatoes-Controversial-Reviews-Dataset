Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's long but it doesn't seem like it because of the strong narrative. And the humour added some light relief. Adam Driver is excellent as Kylo Ren and it is a fitting farewell to Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia. This is all part of an obvious quest to widen its audience\\, which die-hard fans have criticised. Hopefully what seemed like superfluous plot sections will have their worth become apparent in alter movies.","true":true}
