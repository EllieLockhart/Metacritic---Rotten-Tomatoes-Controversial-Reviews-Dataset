Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well I will congratulate Mr Johnson and Ms. Kennedy in destroying a franchise. This movie is an utter disaster. It completely throws the idea of family out the window for a more SJW tenant and direction. I hate to say it but I will not ever go and see another Star Wars film after this.","true":true}
