Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some of it was incredibly good. But so much awful destroyed the overall feeling. I went into this movie the morning it opened in France (Wednesday\\, two days ahead of the worldwide opening) and had only heard great reviews. I was so excited. But when I walked out I was so confused\\, thinking\\, \\\"Really? Did we watch a different movie?\\\" I personally like change and new directions\\, and I don't mind how they treated Luke's character. My issue is that the new characters and storylines are simply unengaging. I have no interest in any of it. Which is a shame because I'm a life-long Star Wars fan and really wanted to like these new movies. For the first time ever (with both Solo and Episode IX)\\, I have no interest in watching upcoming instalments. Maybe if they make some Old Republic films or something\\, or fast-forward a couple centuries. But whatever happens\\, they're going to have to stop piggybacking off of the popularity of the Star Wars brand and actually be creative for once. It's been a very long time since someone wrote a good Star Wars story for the screen. About 35 years actually.","true":true}
