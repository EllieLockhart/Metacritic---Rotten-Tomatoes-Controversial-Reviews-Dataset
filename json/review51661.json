Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A deep disappointment. Disney has killed the Star Wars universe. Shoddy plot full of holes and no real meaning or depth. Has great visual effects but without A great story it means nothing.  No real Force training is really required now\\, thousands of years of Jedi temples and this girl who picks up Luke's old light saber can master the Force? You killed Yoda for me too\\,  I would Force choke Disney executives if I could. Make another one like R1!","true":true}
