Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sigh\\, I thought Disney was the chosen one.  That it would bring balance to the Star Wars franchise not lead it into darkness.  I made the tragic mistake of watching and re-watching Stranger Things season 1 and 2 before watching The Last Jedi.  I think as I tried to analyze this movie the more my mind gravitated towards how bad overall the production quality was.  It's truly intriguing to me how the rating of this movie is so high\\, despite when I ask people what they thought of it 9 out of 10 say the movie was terrible.  I think there is some collusion with the critic and the execs of Disney- I might be wrong but I have a bad feeling about this.  Moving on\\, I think the other aspect the rubbed me the wrong way was lack of plot; went from loving the writing in Stranger Things to this... this thing... That I guess critics say is good\\, as for me it's like walking behind a wet wookie- it stinks and the more your around it the more it stinks up the place.  I thought the dialogue was weak as well\\, it just felt like in most of the scenes it was a bit forced and lacked an ebb and flow to it as it does with when there is good well thought out dialogue but I digress.   I found the sense of humor rather slapstick and mirrored off a bad SNL skit- if that's the direction the director was heading for bravo you did a wonderful job of butchering humor even in a Star Wars movie.  The lack of character development was painful for me to watch\\, I couldn't help but think as I watched this movie- when does this garbage end?  Several times I had to force myself to endure this torturous movie rather than get up and leave the theater- I think the fresh and rotten marks need to be switched where 301 are rotten and 27 are fresh.  Moving on again\\, this isn't the movie I was looking for.  I suppose it's my fault for having any kind of expectations\\, The Last Jedi systematically destroyed the legacy\\, character and memory of Luke Skywalker- I couldn't believe the lack of regard for such an important character.  I was offended by the directors desire to put gender and racial equality in this film; really we haven't had enough politics so you decide to stick and muck up a beloved franchise- shame on the quality control person\\, shame on Disney and shame of the pathetic director for using a movie as political talking platform.   The plot was awful\\, killing off Snoke was a joke even greater punking of a sith charactre the likes of which haven't been seen since Darth Maul gets cut in half by a padawan Kenobi.  I think over all The Last Jedi is by far the worst movie in Star Wars franchise\\, even worse than Phantom Menace- if you like Star Wars stay far far away from this movie- it will only let you down and leave you with a strong disturbance in the Force.","true":true}
