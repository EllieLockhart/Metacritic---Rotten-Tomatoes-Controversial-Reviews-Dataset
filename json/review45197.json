Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unlike The Force Awakens which played things far too safe this movie takes bold risks and takes the story in a direction you genuinely don't expect. Mark Hamill probably gives his best performance as Luke ever as does the late Carrie Fisher. Filled with intense action\\, humor\\, and a moving plot this is a memorable Star Wars movie that is the best since Empire","true":true}
