Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A franchise caught between two philosophies: to move on from the old Star Wars and to shamelessly ape it while doing few new things of interest. All the risks they took were with its legacy; none with the new cast. It didn't pay off. Here we are 2\/3rds of the way through a trilogy and the characters and setting feel less developed than A New Hope accomplished in one film\\, yet it sees fit to undo the accomplishments of the cast of the original. The Marvel treatment isn't going to work.","true":true}
