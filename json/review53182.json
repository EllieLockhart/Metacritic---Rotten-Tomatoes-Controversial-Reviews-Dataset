Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Been a die hard Star Wars fan since I was born in 89. It was fun and had a couple chair gripping scenes. But there was so many headscratching moments that had me leaving the movie theater with question marks all over my head instead of pure joy. My biggest problem is that it doesn't seem like Disney realizes that Star Wars is a space opera first and foremost. The creative mind of Lucas is what made Star Wars so mythological. That imagination and fantasy felt to be absent (especially with the casino subplot.) Disney seems to be treating this franchise just like their comic book movies with pure eye candy visuals and throw back easter eggs. All the while shutting down the previous installments with our real heroes and forcing us to move on with characters we are still not truly connected with.","true":true}
