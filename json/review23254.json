Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it. It wasn't a perfect movie\\, but the good far outweighed the challenges in my opinion. The visuals were spectacular\\, the fight sequences were stunning and the humor was mostly spot on.","true":true}
