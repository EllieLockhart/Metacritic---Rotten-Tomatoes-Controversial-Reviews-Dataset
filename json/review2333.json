Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A truly breathtaking piece of garbage.  There is virtually nothing in this film that honors the spirit of Star Wars\\, instead opting for a hamfisted\\, campy\\, inept ride through some of most idiotic plot-writing decisions made for any film this year.  JJ Abrams' good work has been mutilated by this buffoon.","true":true}
