We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"It's this simple.  The positives: The graphics are fantastic\\, the game is longer (which can be a negative at times)\\, the level design bigger\/better than the original & the gameplay is slightly improved from the original\\, but nothing drastic.  The jump button is a welcome addition\\, but it's barely useful for anything at all.\r\rThe negatives:  The story is abysmal & depressing.  I honestly don't know if I ever played a more depressing game with characters I could care less about.  Besides the stuff with Joel\\, Ellie becomes almost completely unlikable\\, by the end of the game\\, I didn't care about any of the characters at all.  I just wanted it to be over.  On top of this\\, The decisions & conclusions the characters make are completely irrational and illogical.  It's a complete disservice to Joel\\, Ellie and the original story.  The gameplay while slightly improved feels dated and gets boring & really drags through the second half.\r\rIt's definitely not worth 60 bucks\\, I wish I would've waited for a used copy down the road.  Selling this one on Ebay!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
