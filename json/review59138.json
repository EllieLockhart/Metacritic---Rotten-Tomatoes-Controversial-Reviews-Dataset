The review bombing is completely unjustified and frankly embarrassing.\r\rGameplay wise the game is a huge step up from the first game\\, it's more intense and far more visceral\\, especially melee combat which feels meaty. Small additions like being able to go prone open up lots of possibly for stealth\\, being able to crawl under cars\\, lay in grass to avoid patrols really opened up your options. The game also feels far more responsive than other games going for this hyper realistic style\\, gameplay was not sidelined for realism. As with all Naughty Dog games there were also many amazing set pieces with intense action sequences that got the adrenaline pumping.\r\rVisually it's a masterpiece\\, the cut scenes especially were fantastic. The animations were just on another level\\, which made the game feel so much more realistic\\, the tiniest details were paid attention to and it made a big difference overall. The lighting\\, textures\\, shadows\\, character models and particle effects were all so well done\\, the developers didn't leave any of the PS4s power on the table\\, and they did it all without too many performance drops.\r\rThe audio was top-notch\\, with industry leading voice work and some of the best atmospheric sounds I've ever heard\\, which helped the gameplay feel beyond intense at times\\, certain areas were legitimately terrifying. One small touch which I loved was the fact enemies called out names when you killed their friends\\, it made them seem more real\\, instead of just random NPCs.\r\rThe story was excellent\\, with some truly heartbreaking moments and lots of little stories interwoven throughout. You got to see the other side of the story in a way that's rarely the case\\, which made you reflect on your decisions and made you ask yourself \\\"am I the bad guy?\\\".\r\rOverall The Last of Us II is a masterpiece\\, and a game you definitely should play\\, unless you have a problem with a gay lead\\, like the people review bombing one of the best games ever made ;)\u2026 Expand","true":true}
