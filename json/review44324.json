Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many plot holes and Deus Ex to even take it seriously. There was a specific scene in the third act that left you awestruck\\, but it wasn't even close to redeeming the rest of the movie. Truly a disappointment.","true":true}
