Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For me this SW misses depth in characters and a realistic approach. It's been said that the people behind SW are fans\\, but I guess they mixed that up with Space balls with the amount of humour added and the unrealistic approach they took. I wouldn't be surprised if Lone Starr drops by in the next film.","true":true}
