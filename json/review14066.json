Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you're a fan of the franchise and just want to sit down and watch a Star Wars movie\\, you're at the wrong place. If you're a casual and don't care about any of the facts and lore from Star Wars as a whole and don't care about what was previously established in episode 7 than I'm sure you'll love this hot garbage.","true":true}
