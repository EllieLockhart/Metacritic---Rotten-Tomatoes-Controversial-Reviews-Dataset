Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie took the Star Wars franchise in a new (and brilliant!) direction. Mark Hamill and Adam Driver delivered incredible performances\\, Kelly Marie Tran and the new trio are a joy to watch\\, and Carrie Fisher gave a beautiful final performance. There are a couple of absolutely stunning moments that will surprise you. The film also has surprisingly weighty themes about failure and loss\\, and manages to pull them off well\\, though there are some issues with tone and consistency. This\\, plus the movie being a bit too long\\, reduces my rating a half-star. A fantastic film overall.","true":true}
