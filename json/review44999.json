Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"una ciofeca senza precedenti\\, carrie fisher che vola come mary poppins\\, snoke ucciso senza una singola spiegazione\\, Ray la mary sue della disney e la chiattona cinese che per salvare finn lascia cannoneggiare l'entrata della base ribelle.  Il plot e la storia sembra scritta da una scimmia urlatrice con la meningite permanente.  Ma qualcuno alla disney li legge i copioni... o almeno li scrivono i copioni? Il film peggiore in assoluto non solo della saga di star wars ma proprio IL PEGGIORE IN ASSOLUTO.","true":false}
