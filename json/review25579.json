Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a bot. This movie didn't ruin my childhood. I'm not a whiny 40 year old. The movie was just poorly done. The actors were great and the visuals were amazing. But the \\\"plot\\\" and extra characters were worthles... \\\"Let the past die\\\" well great. Why did you introduce a worthless purple haired character and kill her off. That would've been an incredible send off for Leia even if hyperspace doesn't do that in any other movie. Whatever moving on... you can't seriously think that an entire First order fleet would just drift behind the resistance and wait for them to run out of fuel? Like really? That's the incredible plot you could come up with? You are telling me that a massive military regime that rose up from the destruction of the Empire would just set their ships on cruise control and shoot them from afar? No. I can set aside the horrible Canto Bight story\\, deaths of major characters that have no development or story\\, the fact that TFA plot line was thrown in the garbage. But the Forst Order being as aggressive as it is didn't send every Tie Fighter\\, Bomber\\, etc at the Resistance fleet is just stupid. I'm glad people liked all the lights\\, sounds\\, and Porgs but this movie was truly horrendous. I feel bad that they just shat on Leia's legacy and made her a big joke.","true":true}
