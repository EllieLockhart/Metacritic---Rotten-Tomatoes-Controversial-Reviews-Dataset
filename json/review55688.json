Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok so here goes. TERRIBLE. A total let down after the rubbish Force Awakens.\\nNo spoilers\\, but I hate what they have done with Luke. There's a scene with Leia which is stupid beyond belief. Chewie has absolutely no purpose. There are scenes which can only be described as some crap Jedi FaceTime idea. Weak story. Hardly anything has changed by the end of the movie with the exception of some characters dying. No memorable dialogue.\\nAnd finally\\, Zero character development. To demonstrate what I mean think of Snoke\\, Rey and Finn. Now imagine you are describing them to a friend who has never seen Star Wars before. Now do that without saying what they look like or what their profession or role in the movie is. Not easy because there's no substance to them to make them interesting to watch. Now do that for Luke\\, Han and Vader. Get my point?","true":true}
