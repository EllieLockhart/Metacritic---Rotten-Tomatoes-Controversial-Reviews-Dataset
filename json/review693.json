Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An amazing addition to the star wars canon. At first I was a little skeptical with certain decisions but after much thinking it was perfect and taught me not to look to much into certain things! Loved to see more like this.","true":true}
