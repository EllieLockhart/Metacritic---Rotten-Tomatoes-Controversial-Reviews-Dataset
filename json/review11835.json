Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How to make money from 40years old franchise? Feel the force of commercialism. For kids - small owl-like plush-toys. For girls - crescents-shape necklaces. For boys - dices on a gold chain. SW-LJ is one big commercial of gadgets selled for poor nerds. As a movie LJ does not exists without previous and next part of this space-soap-opera. No thread is started or finished\\, so purposes of this movie is just to serve as life support for making money machine called 'Star Wars'. Music is the same for 40 years. Grotesque theatrical acting also. Absurdities like sound of mighty explosions in space (many many many times)\\, or characters breathing in space or in every planet makes this franchise very unrealistic and childish. It would be okay if it was not so violent\\, full of grotesque deaths\\, and mass killing straight from a computer games.\\n\\nIt is a monumental show of special effects\\, full of gadget ads\\, completely incomprehensible for people who do not know the previous part\\, and does not have any sense without next part. I really admire the art of making money on understatements and milking nerds. So go\\, feel the force of money\\, and may the force of commerce be with you!","true":true}
