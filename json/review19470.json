Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's the most engaged I've felt in years\\, at least since 'Zootopia.' The characters make surprising decisions that\\, while leaving me conflicted\\, still manage to feel true to their goals and ideals. It's been a joy to speculate motivations and intentions with open-minded fans\\, to ply ideas against what was physically present on screen and watch them either crumble or ascend. Mark Hamill delivers an exceptional performance\\, and the character of Kylo Ren is perhaps the most petty\\, pathetic\\, and interesting villain I've seen in a while.\\n\\nFor all it's faults\\, there is more than enough good here to examine for years\\, even decades to come. 'The Last Jedi' is easily among the top 3 best Star Wars movies.","true":true}
