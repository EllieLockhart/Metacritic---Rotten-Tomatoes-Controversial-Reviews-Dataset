Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a great... example of why Star Wars needs to be taken away from Disney and given back to the fans.  In fact\\, this movie has convinced me that the only character worth salvaging is Poe.  The Last Jedi tries to portray everything Poe does as arrogant and wrong\\, yet he's the only one making the sensible calls in a desperate war.  This movie shows me the writers don't understand the scenarios they themselves set up.","true":true}
