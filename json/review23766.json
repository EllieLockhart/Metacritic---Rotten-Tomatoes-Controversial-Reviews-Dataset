Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke Skywalker takes center stage\\, returning to the screen (and the rebellion) after what seems like a lengthy hibernation in his family saga's long-awaited eighth episode. Of course\\, it's a creative wonderland\\, as all Star Wars movies are. Loaded with brilliant new settings\\, refreshing spins on old ones\\, wild unseen alien races and explosive action scenes\\, it retains its roots in an artistic sense. One particular scene\\, a lightsaber melee in Snoke's deep crimson throne room\\, sticks with me as one of the best-directed fights in the series. But there's much more to this picture than mere aesthetics. The Last Jedi constantly defies expectation\\, seemingly delighting in the chance to throw passionate fans off the scent. From character actions to fake-out non-revelations to the plot's relatively small scale\\, none of it is quite what I expected. More than once\\, I caught myself holding my breath\\, ready to be let down by a decision that seemed inevitable\\, and each time the film bucked me in a direction I hadn't considered. Sometimes that works to its benefit and sometimes it doesn't. It's a slower\\, more contemplative take on the franchise\\, particularly in the first act\\, which leads to a longer running time (longest of the entire series) without feeling too strung out or overly indulgent. Unlike The Force Awakens\\, Episode VIII uses its front-and-center returning cast to enrich and enhance the newer faces. Where Han Solo thoroughly dominated the screen\\, Luke and Leia use two very different methods to help Rey and Poe grow into heroes worthy of taking the spotlight. That's of crucial importance\\, and that it's missing from Finn's stalled character arc is a problem. Kylo Ren sees significant growth\\, too\\, successfully navigating a very delicate balancing act as his interactions with Rey\\, his light-side counterpart\\, gradually unfold. Not every gamble pays off\\, and it's hardly a film without faults\\, but I appreciate how often it was able to surprise me and its ability to wrangle so many threads together into a cohesive narrative. My first impressions have it a hair above the preceding episode\\, and on equal footing with Return of the Jedi.","true":true}
