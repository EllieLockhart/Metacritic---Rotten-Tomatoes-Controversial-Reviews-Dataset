Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With all the stories they had available that they took away from cannon\\, they put together a mess of a story\\, and the writers clearly had no understanding of the original trilogy or the characters that existed. this is a dismal excuse for a star wars movie filled with poor characters and attempts to buy the audience with cutesey characters turned this potentially amazing story into hot garbage","true":true}
