Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a shockingly bad film.  Disney's and Rian Johnson's treatment of Star Wars fans is reprehensible.  I'm hoping this trilogy is discarded and rebooted properly as soon as possible.  A real shame though - Disney had a chance to do something great with Mark Hamill\\, Harrison Ford\\, and Carrie Fisher\\, but sadly we will never get to see it.","true":true}
