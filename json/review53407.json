Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing.  The Kailo-Ren character was the saving grace\\, finally well played and scripted\\, best character in film.  Rey and Hux characters held their own.  Rest of cast and script were too often silly\\, ridiculous\\, or excessively unrealistic.  Some humor worked\\, other lines or scenes were just silly and force viewer to not take the movie seriously.  The opening space sequence and the final frozen salt planet sequences were well made\\, but the movie could have done without the senior female flight officer wearing a ballroom dress\\, Leia somehow surviving space exposure\\, the entire deck scene with Finn after flagship gets split in two (they survive without a scratch while everyone around them is dead or appears again out of the backdrop to come fight them when they should be fleeing in panic)\\, the creatures on Luke's island\\, the way Luke is written out at end\\, the professional horseback riding by Finn and his female asian associate when she had never ridden before in her life\\, the lesbian-inferred hand holding with Leia\\, the military government industrial complex concept with the casino planet\\, the excessive use of females in combat roles who do not look the part (should be butch rather than effeminate)\\, the list goes on.  Disney and Rian should watch Rogue One and learn a lesson on how to reboot a Star Wars franchise\\, this is getting too disappointing.  Rogue One was excellent\\, The Force Awakens was tolerable\\, The Last Jedi unfortunately disappoints.  The only potential for a sequel is good use of KailoRen and Rey and hopefully reduce the political correctness or social justice nonsence and bad humor.  Unless this was intended for children where Disney can run amok with this franchise and i have to hope for future Rogue One type story fill-in movies.","true":true}
