Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best and most innovative Star Wars movie yet. I'm a fan of the franchise but I can't deny that all of the previous films follow very similar story beats. This one does something different by subverting expectations and telling a story about the consequences (both positive and negative) of expectations and blind belief. The acting is great\\, the action and SFX are outstanding and I was absolutely thrilled by it.","true":true}
