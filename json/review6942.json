Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily my favorite Star Wars movie.  Darker\\, more comprehensive story\\, backstories for each character\\, personal motive and ideal that affected every character.  It was like Star Wars\\, only if it were actually plot and action centric\\, but had balance with plot as well.","true":true}
