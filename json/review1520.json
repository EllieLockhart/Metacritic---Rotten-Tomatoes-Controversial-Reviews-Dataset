Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lifelong die hard fan of Star Wars who has seen every movie dozens of times\\, watched every clone wars and rebels episode\\, all I can say is that I left the theater with nothing but a complete feeling of emptiness. Shame on Disney and Lucasfilm.","true":true}
