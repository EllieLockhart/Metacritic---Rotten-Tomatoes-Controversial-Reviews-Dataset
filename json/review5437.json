Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite some of the audience reviews\\, I thought it was an excellent film; full of tense moments and plenty of misdirection. Force Awakens was clearly a love letter to New Hope\\, and I felt this film played off of that expectation well... flipping any expectations you have based on Empire Strikes Back on their head. In fact\\, I'm sure the disappointment for several viewers is the fact that certain expectations were built during the first film\\, just for this one to pull the rug out from under you... the one instance in which I felt let down was the discovery of Rae's parentage; but even there\\, I kind of respect them not going down the obvious path many of us expected. All in all\\, pretty great film.","true":true}
