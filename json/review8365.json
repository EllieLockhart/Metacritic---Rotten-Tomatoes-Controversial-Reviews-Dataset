Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Felt like it was written by people who saw the original trilogy\\, but didn't like it.  A some of the issues I had includes: \\n1. Luke's actions for most of the movie does not align with the character's background or personality.  \\n2.  Use of sub-plot to advance writer's personnel views instead of the story.\\n3.  Random tactical decisions that make no sense on both sides of the battle(s)\\n4.  For a movie that supposed to be showing diversity\\, the bad guys seem pretty monochromatic and strangely male dominate.","true":true}
