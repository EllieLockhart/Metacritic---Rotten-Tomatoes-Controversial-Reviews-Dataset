Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie starts very promising\\, then it drags and drags. So many plot holes never get resolved\\, specially some that had been planted since The Force Awakens. Mark Hamill and Daisy Ridley try their best\\, but they cannot save the entire movie. Oscar Isaac and Carrie Fisher are criminally underused.","true":true}
