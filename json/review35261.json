Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The good thing about this movie is Episode II: Attack of the Clones\\, is no longer the worst Star Wars movie. The departure from the franchise this might as well have been a completely different movie. I think that's what they were doing anyway\\, but using the SW name allowed them to sell tickets. The pacing is awful\\, the story is hacked together and could have been better tied together with duct tape.  As I was trying to watch it it's like no one took a final edit review of this. The jokes could have been shorter and tighter. Entire scenes replaced. And some pacing choices corrected for a better flow. Overall the acting was the one good thing. I'll Give 1.5 stars toward the actors. 0 for direction and story-boarding.","true":true}
