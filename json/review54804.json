Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think with most fans who are disappointed like myself\\, the way this movie disappoints cuts deep. How can a new Star Wars film feature such poor story writing and lack of continuation of plot points and character archs from the previous chapter of it\u2019s trilogy and the overall saga? When you add a new chapter to a saga\\, particularly one as revered and long standing as Star Wars with characters in preceding films over the course of 40 years (1977 - 2017)\\, you have to connect the dots to the other saga films in a way that makes sense - especially the film that was right before yours and the film that will come right after yours in your own trilogy of the saga. Reading the positive reviews of the film\\, the central theme is praise for it being different\\, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s different in a worthwhile way. What it did was take everything that was set up before and turn it on itself so that it meant nothing or was the opposite of what it started as. That\u2019s not great story telling\\, it\u2019s a cop out of taking the time needed and deserved to write a compelling story that moves the characters forward on their archs that were built up over their preceding stories. What\u2019s frustrating is that Rian and Kathleen seem to have forgotten that the only reason they were able to earn over a billion in tickets sales for this movie was because of the stories that were told before it and the characters the fans were excited to see developed. Perhaps the biggest reason most of us paid to see The Last Jedi was to see Luke Skywalker help save the galaxy once again in the wake of Hans Solo\u2019s departure in the previous film - and while we did ultimately get that in the story\\, as most fans of the character including Mark Hamill have commented\\, the way Luke\u2019s story was handled in this film was uncharacteristic and sad. I take my hat off to Mark Hamill who seems a genuine human being in every interview and is what every fan wants in an actor\/actress\\, a true believer of his character and story. He has politely and professionally shared he does not agree with The Last Jedi and yet understood it was not his story and made the movie the studio and director asked him to. To make my point about this movie\\, my final thought is to take a look at this picture of Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) next to Rian Johnson who directed The Last Jedi. Rian\\, tell me how you can create a film about Luke Skywalker 30 years after we saw what he did in Star Wars: Return of the Jedi that makes fans of the character including the actor playing the character look this sad? What kind of weird Star Wars adventures did you play when you were growing up\\, because me\\, I\u2019d have written a very different film... and with over a billion in ticket sales so far\\, but a Rotten Tomatoes audience rating of below 50% as I write this\\, I know I\u2019m not alone.
