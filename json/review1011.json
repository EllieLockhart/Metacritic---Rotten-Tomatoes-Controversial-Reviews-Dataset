Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Another excellent entry in the franchise.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\nI loved the character arcs presented in the film mainly lukes and kylos. Lukes added depth to his character and made people think about things that otherwise would gone unnoticed such as his emotional outburst in palpatines throne room. Kylo has quickly become my favourite character thanks to the uniqueness and uncertainty present around his character. The fact that he is so torn makes for some interesting engagements with other characters.\\n\\nThe planets each had distinct attributes to them and they fit nicely into the universe. \\n\\nThe visuals are amazing (especially crait) and some of the camera shots such as luke facing down the first order are up there with the best in the series. \\n\\nThe musical score is as great as ever.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\nThe pacing could be a bit wierd as the film zipped around the 3 main arcs a little too suddenly on some occassions. Canto bight last a bit too long and could have benefitted from being a few minutes shorter.\\n\\nThe space chase (as interesting as it was) didn't really match up to other setpieces in the franchise for me outside of holdo's sacrifice.\\n\\nPhasma was much better excecuted in this film but i don't feel she should have been killed off in the second part of the trilogy. I would have preferred her to be part of the final battle between the two factions.","true":true}
