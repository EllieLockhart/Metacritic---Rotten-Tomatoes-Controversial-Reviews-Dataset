{"101487":166501,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2019-07-28","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Seeing The Last Jedi in theaters for the first time a thrilling experience as a long-time obsessive fan of the franchise\\, and as a movie fanatic\\, with one of my personal favorite modern writer\/directors at the helm. By the time the movie came out\\, I had somewhat outgrown my obsession. Or so I thought\\, because I could barely sleep the night before wondering if it was going to be good\\, okay\\, or terrible. Some would chalk up my enjoyment of the film as a form of cognitive dissonance\\, but to that I would say \u201cno u.\u201d I just have so much fun watching it. There are those who say the only way to treat this movie is to neither overly deride it or give it excessive praise\\, but I wholeheartedly enjoy this movie\\, so... yeah\\, that\u2019s praise. People comparing it to The Phantom Menace or Attack of the Clones\u00a0probably like those movies way too much\\, because the levels of quality aren\u2019t even comparable. Watching this from a writerly perspective\\, and actively analyzing it like any other film that I would watch\\, even other\u00a0Star Wars movies\\, I find this one to be of high quality. It\u2019s also its own satisfying and complete story\\, but it still leaves me wanting another episode.\u00a0Just real quick: Solo and Rogue One don\u2019t even touch TFA and TLJ in filmmaking terms. They are the first \u201cskippable\u201d Star Wars movies. Honestly\\, I\u2019d recommend skipping them. You may have fun with them\\, but I sure didn\u2019t (especially with Solo\\, which was a total drag.) Anyway\\, I\u2019m sure\u00a0The Last Jedi did right by my childhood or whatever\\, but that\u2019s not very important. What\u2019s more important is that it did right by my current and more informed standards (and it continues to improve every time I see it.) Kids like dumb crap and watch the same stupid low-quality cartoons over and over again with no discretion. So\\, I trust current me more than child me in terms of what\u2019s \u201cgood.\u201d","true":true}
