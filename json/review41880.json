Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is the worst star wars film and the only one that I have not enjoyed. They established and set up so many plots in the previous film (such as the knights of Ren) that they completely got rid of in this film.Luke Skywalker deserved better. Someone please explain to me how in the span of at most a couple of days the new republic fell. Rian Johnson should be fired. J.J. Abrams should have directed this movie.","true":true}
