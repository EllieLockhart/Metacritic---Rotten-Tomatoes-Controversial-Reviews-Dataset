Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie. It was a very different movie from what was expected and went into a different direction\\, but that in itself played into the theme of the movie. Making a shift from the old generation to the new and moving on from the past. Aspects I loved about this movie was acting of the late great Carrie Fisher\\, the chemistry between the main stars in key scenes\\, and return of Mark Hamill to the mantle of Luke Skywalker. I am interested to see the uncut film\\, but as it stand this move 2 and a half hours. I enjoyed every bit of it. My only concern is some plot strings didn't quite match up. Leaving questions from Force Awakens film and leaving some to be answered in the 9th. I am okay with that actually. I enjoyed the movie and the questions it left for us.","true":true}
