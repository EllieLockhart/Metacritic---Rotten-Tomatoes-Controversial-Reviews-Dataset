Naughty Dog's showed us the dark apocalypse world. All this angry\\, feelings of revenge and the path with its consequences. I really liked it and I kinda was angry when my lovely character Joel died but it is post apocalypse world. Everything can happen. So I was ready for this and don't get sad about it.The negatives is for this LGBTQ things I really don't get and Ellie was immune at least she could be get pregnant and give a birth new immune kids. But she chooses be a lesbian. And all main charactersare womens I mean it is funny. At least it coul6be equal. For female main characters we have many games like horizon zero dawn or tomb raider. why ruin TLOU with this feminist things. I really don't get it But I would like to see part III amd with this third game they need end this story and not going with this lesbian and female only character. at least do it equally\u2026 Expand","true":true}
