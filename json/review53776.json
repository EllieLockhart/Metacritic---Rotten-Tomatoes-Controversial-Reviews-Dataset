Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great movie.\\n\\nI really liked the part where shooting first and think later doesnt work.\\n\\nPoe disobeyed an direct order\\, the battleship got destroyed\\, but with huge losses.\\n\\nThen he helped and encouraged Finn and Rose to disable the tracking device.\\nThis leads the the destruction of the transports.\\nBut in the end he started to think first and found a way out of the mine.","true":true}
