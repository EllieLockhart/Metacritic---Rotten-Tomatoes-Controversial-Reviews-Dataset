Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A horrendous addition to the Star Wars saga. As soon as the iconic opening text passes you are met with humour that is out of place in the star wars universe. The different approach Rian Johnson has on Star Wars is admirable but not welcome. After The Force Awakens has a promising continuation on the Star Wars story\\, The Last Jedi destroys it. Many plot lines are thrown away and making any mystery pointless which then\\, in turn\\, makes The Force Awakens feel the same as much of its mystery is answered in moment that changes nothing. Any dramatic moments are all too \\\"uplifting\\\" with many cringe worthy jokes being made that pull you away from what could make the story suspenseful. With the negative fan backlash which is deserving for this movie\\, the only hope is that JJ Abrams can gain fans trust after the success of The Force Awakens.","true":true}
