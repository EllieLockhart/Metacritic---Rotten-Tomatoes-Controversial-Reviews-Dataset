Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a Star Wars fan who just spent a couple days watching the past 7 movies\\, I was extremely excited for this and had high expectations after TFAW. However this movie was extremely disappointing and an utter disgrace to Luke. Also why is Snoke a character? I was extremely excited to see who he was and how he was so powerful\\, but he does absolutely nothing. Also Rose and Fin\u2019s story line is downright useless and I hope Rose doesn\u2019t come back. BB 8 is probably the best character in Star Wars now and it is extremely sad. Way to ruin a lot of people\u2019s nights with this one Johnson\\, thanks a lot. Hopefully they make episode 9 feel like Star Wars again....","true":true}
