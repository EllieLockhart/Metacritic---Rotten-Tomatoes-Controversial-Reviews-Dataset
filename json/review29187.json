Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Regrettably\\, I didn't like this film.  The humor was over-the-top as was some of the action (i.e. one character being blown into space and surviving).  New characters and good actors seemed unecessary and wasted\\, respectively.  I did like some of the character development and plot but overall I was disappointed in this film more than any other star wars film\\, including the prequels.  This film made me less interested in seeing the next one and I thought I was a lifelong Star Wars fan\\, having seen the original when I was 6.","true":true}
