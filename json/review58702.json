Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Ok\\, for me this game isn't 10\/10 neither 1\/10. Ellie is little washed out of charisma\\, as all of the characters\\, transition to second playable is awfull\\, all the more that is's even more personality flat. Generic \\, similar sayings don't help at that point. Poor dialogs as written by ND. At first scenario is classic exemple of how not to do it\\, they\\\"ve been eaten by ambitons maybye.

I dont think the is SOOO MUCH LGBT propaganda as people are saying\\, also the ending coud be worst. And second attempt shows the scenario is pretty smart. The most annoying aspect of gameplay was dumb NPC walking into youre position\\, little bugs especially in second part\\, maybye skill advancement tree coul'd be better .\rAfter that we've got sweetest possible graphics\\, abandoned buildings are new main character for me. Cool melee violence\\, finishers\\, most realistic blood pools ever ;) Couple of amazing sequences\\, few minibosses and one resident evil like big one which remains in memory. More open areas slots well onto fresher combat aproach. Loading times and technical part of the game also deserves an aplause.  Overall gameplay is immersive.\rSoon i'll start NG+ with moore stealth aproach\\, im curious\\, does boredom of walking\/talking parts will push me off...\rFirst game was special... this one is just a good game ;)\rSorry for vocab flaws\\, thanks for reading if got here ;)\rPs: Fook the trolls ;p\u2026 Expand","true":true}
