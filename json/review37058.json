Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The newer Star Wars film fail epically in character development. You leave the film not really caring much about the characters or their struggles because there is no back story or personality to any of them!","true":true}
