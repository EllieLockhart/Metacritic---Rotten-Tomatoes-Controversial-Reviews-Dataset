Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am incredibly disappointed in this movie.\\nI think it's a complete disaster with writer Rian Johnson\\, it's like he have never seen or read anything related to Star Wars.\\nLike Mark Hamill said\\, they only focus on making money\\, and they don't care about any of the characters or making a good movie.\\nWell\\, they do care about developing the new characters Rey\\, Kylo\\, Finn\\, etc... but with great disregard for the original characters.\\n\\nThe movie is really well made in a sense of scenery\\, it's visually really well made but the content as I specified earlier... is incredibly bad\\, I am at loss for words\\, can't believe they ruined the Star Wars universe.","true":true}
