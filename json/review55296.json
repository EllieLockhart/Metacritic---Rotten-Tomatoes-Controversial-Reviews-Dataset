Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let's just say I'm not happy about the way this film and the script turned out. Visually it is stunning but as for substance\\, this film has very little going for it. Everything you know about classic characters gets challenged and not in a good way. JJ Abrams is going to have one hell of a time trying to fix the mess this movie creates with episode IX.","true":true}
