Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a gorgeously directed movie.The Last Jedi was an excellent movie that takes a while to process and needs a second viewing. There is a lot to unpack from The Last Jedi. This movie\\, not a remake of The Empire Strikes Back\\, is completely different than any other Star Wars movie but yet it feels like Star Wars. It echoes themes from the originals (e.g.\\, The Return of the Jedi) and some from the prequels (especially Attack of the Clones)\\, as well as a couple of elements from the novel\\, Leia\\, Princess of Alderaan. The humor is wonderful. John Williams' music was awesome and not rushed liked it was for The Force Awakens. The movie has several unexpected moments and \\\"This does not turn out like you think\\\" (said Luke Skywalker). Carrie Fisher\\, in her final full movie\\, gave an epic performance. The filming and choreography are fantastic. Of course\\, no movie\\, no Star Wars movie\\, is perfect and it's too easy to nick pick things\\, especially about the plot. This film may well divide fans of the originals vs fans of these new Disney sequels. So I ask: Do you want to see the same stuff over and over\\, or be surprised? Star Wars needs to reinvent itself a little to keep things fresh\\, while still maintaining what we love about it\\, which I fully believe The Last Jedi did. This movie deepens the mythology of the Jedi.","true":true}
