Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst Star Wars movie in the history of the franchise. If you liked it I'm truly happy for you. But to me if you have to tear down the original characters in a vain attempt to build up your new characters\\, then you are already working from behind. There really any point in me going on\\, though I will say the discrepancy between fans and critics looks like critics trying to stay on the good side of Disney. Since I'm late rating this\\, I'll also add I have no intention of giving them any money for Solo. You folks have a great day.","true":true}
