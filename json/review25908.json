Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not great\\, definitely a giant let down\\, some characters should have been explored but were just redundant (the codebreaker)\\, he should been more in the film or completely cut\\,  just so much pointless story. Mediocre at best.","true":true}
