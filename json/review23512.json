Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved the story and how unexpected each plot twist was. The audience cheered at the awesome action moments\\, and laughed at the generally well crafted comedy. I did not like the Rey and Kylo interactions\\, and felt the characters\\, old and new\\, were not lovable like in ep 7 or Rogue One\\, hence the 4 stars. But beyond that\\, I liked the new characters they introduced and am really looking forward to the sequel.","true":true}
