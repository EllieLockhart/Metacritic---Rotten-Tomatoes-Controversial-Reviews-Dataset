Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Stray too much from the Lucas formula & people lose their minds. Play it safe and stick to the same old schtick & feel the wrath of the same ones that complain. You can't make everyone happy\\, but this movie is by far on my top 3 of Star Wars movies. While it doesn't give answers away that some wanted\\, the movie is itself enjoyable and hits all the right buttons throughout. I'm surprised by the feedback so far\\, but it seems like everyone is a critic nowadays. Nitpicking is the cool thing to do.","true":true}
