Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The action scenes were pretty cool so I give it 2 stars for that... The story was full of huge plot holes\\, the humor felt too much like marvel movies which ruined a lot of scenes (and at points I wasn't sure if certain scenes were supposed to be funny or serious)\\, the lack of back stories for characters was frustrating\\, it felt like all the things JJ Abrams set up in TFA was just wasted (& I wasn't crazy about TFA since it was pretty much a remake of episode 4 but this movie made me appreciate that one so much more lol).\\n\\nThe biggest issue I had with this movie is Snoke... They built him up last movie and this movie to this bad ass that's super powerful\\, became the supreme leader\\, and has use of the force... And explain nothing about him before killing him!!\\n\\nActually as I'm writing this I'm getting angrier so I'm lowering this to one and a half Star lol","true":true}
