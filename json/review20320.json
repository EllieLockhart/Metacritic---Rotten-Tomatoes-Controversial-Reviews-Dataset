Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was the worst film in the whole Star Wars franchise. Nothing works\\, the film end and there is no big villain anymore\\, tensed moments are ruined by humor\\, the plot revolves around a mission that fails and which isn't interesting in any way. The telepathy annoyed me\\, there was never said in any of the films that Jedi had some kind of Bible or any sacred book\\, Poe Dameron is nothing but a dangerous traitor who should get executed (but gets promoted instead at the end). Nothing works.","true":true}
