Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very different Star Wars that still lived up to the originals. It's a major departure from the series similar to empire strikes back. It covers a lot of ground and shows some great character development. Mark Hamill owns it as Luke  who is struggling with failure and letting down those he loved. His story in this is captivating and adds a great nuance to the character.","true":true}
