Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some scenes were very cringy SPOILER: When Princess Leia \\\"flew\\\" back to the ship using the force was extremely strange and I felt very weird during that whole scene.  Fin and Rose's arch was awkward and completely unnecessary.  They had literally no impact on the story.  Phasma was lost potential.  She was hardly in any part of any of the movies\\, terribly lost potential.  Luke and Rey's arch was great\\, I loved that part.  Po was good and Laura Dern's character as the admiral was good\\, she had the plan the whole time going.  The action was great\\, some felt unnecessary but it was good.  Lost potential with killing Snoke\\, he was a non factor in the movie\\, just a place holder for Kylo Ren.","true":true}
