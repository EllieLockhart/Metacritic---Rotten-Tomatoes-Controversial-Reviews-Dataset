Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably my favourite SW movie since A New Hope. And I say that as a long term fan who watched ANH when it was first released. I've been a fan of SW all my 50+ years\\, and I liked TFA\\, but it felt like a retread of old material. This one really opened the universe out to new stories and to go into unexpected places. The development of the characters made a lot of sense to me and made me like all of the heroes more. I have no idea what's coming next and I love that. I can't wait to find out.","true":true}
