Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Remember when our heroes stopped the Empire and saved the galaxy in Return of the Jedi?  Turns out they were making things way\\, way worse.  Remember our main hero who already rejected the binary views of the Jedi and didn't give up hope in his father despite his father murdering his way across the galaxy for 20 years?  Turns out he completely gives up on his nephew the moment he finds out he's gone to the dark side and then goes off to die\\, well not die but spend his days milking sea cows.  The new characters that are meant to replace the old ones are not that interesting so it's hard to imagine caring about episode IX after VIII set out to kill the past (the original trilogy) and succeeded.","true":true}
