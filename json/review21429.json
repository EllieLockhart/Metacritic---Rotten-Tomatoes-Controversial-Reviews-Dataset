Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wonder how much these so called critics were greased? \\nWhen I read these preposterous titles that they came up with for their articles on the last Jedi.\\nI went to see the movie\\, and I was expecting a lot.\\nMaybe I should start of with the fact that I wasn't a fan of Rogue one\\, and I had feared but hoped they wouldn't set that as a standard for their Star wars Saga.\\nI've been a Star wars fan for as long as I can remember\\, but episode 8 made me not want to see the last movie.\\nAfter episode 7 I was still hopeful\\, it was a pathway to a very promising eight chapter. Unfortunately\\, I don't think I could think of a way to make it worse than they had.\\nThis is no longer star wars...\\nJust a generic $$$ Disney movie.\\nTry that on for a title \\\"critics\\\"!","true":true}
