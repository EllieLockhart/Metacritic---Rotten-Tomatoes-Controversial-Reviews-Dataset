{"101487":175010,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-06-27","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi does not feel like a Star Wars movie.  It rides on the presumption that you have bought into its narrative without attempting to conceal its lack of substance.  The actors generally looked confused\\, lost\\, or as if they are trying to act the senselessness out of their behavior or scenario.  Feels like a movie based on the elementary level adaptation of the novelization of a better film.  Not only is it boring\\, it is cringily unfunny.  I laughed once at the pilot who says \\\"right away sir\\\" to Kylo Ren near the end\\, and that was the only time I laughed at intended humor.  I did find myself laughing incredulously at things that were  badly done.  Sharp\\, ironic barks of laughter that would have likely ruined the experience for others had I been in theater.  This movie felt like a TV episode that forgot its run time.  The lightsaber battle was said to be good\\, but I found it pretty weak\\, especially after seeing how these powerful force users had blown away entire buildings without much of a thought.  However\\, even assuming these nameless red shirts matched their force power\\, the choreography was meh\\, and the last opponent Kylo faced seemed to need Kylo's help in getting into position.  However\\, if you find yourself to be like most of the characters in the movie Idiocracy\\, this movie is made just for you.  There isn't much about this movie of any merit.  The dialogue was so patchy\\, and feels like it was written like my review here- in a dialogue box 3 inches wide by 1\/4 inch high by someone who has already forgotten what else he has already covered- and I could make more of an effort\\, but meh\\, it doesn't matter\\, its good enough\\, probably.  Right?  How could you mess up Star Wars?","true":true}
