Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow!! So much to unpack. I will say this - if you liked the prequels\\, you won't love this one. This is much deeper\\, with a lot of challenging conventional themes that previous SW movies\\, particularly the prequels\\, held. I can see how prequel fans don't love this one.\\n\\nBut\\, even then\\, this is a deeper movie than Empire.\\n\\nAll that said\\, it is not dark like Empire. There is hope. There is a ton of levity. The old characters are well serviced. The new ones grow.\\n\\nI take one star off because\\, as many mentioned\\, there is a chunk of it\\, a storyline that could have been simplified greatly\\, or removed\\, and it would have been a much tighter movie.\\n\\nThat said\\, it wasn't enough to ruin the movie. It is something I need to see again\\, to really delve into more\\, and I will.\\n\\nAgain\\, I get the negative reviews from some. If you are looking for some easy\\, shallow\\, simple good v evil story\\, this is not it. If you are looking for something more like Empire\\, that challenges notions of good\\, evil\\, and heroes\\, but still leaves you feeling like there is hope\\, then you\\\"ll love it.","true":true}
