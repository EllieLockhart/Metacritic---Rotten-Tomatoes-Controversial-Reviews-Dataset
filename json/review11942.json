Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Huge plot holes. Characters used to push the run time\\, weird decisions. Why is Holdo there? WTF happened to Luke? Where are the knights of Ren? Snoke? What is Rose doing there? Why are they making captain Phasma so useless? VERTICAL BOMBING IN SPACE? Porgs\\, porgs porgs and other merch\\, oh i mean porgs. CGI is amazing\\, apart from the times when its not... and then it looks really bad.","true":true}
