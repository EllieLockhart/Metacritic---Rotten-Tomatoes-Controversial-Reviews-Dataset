Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been trying to think of a simple way to sum up how I feel about Star Wars: The Last Jedi and the best I've come up with is simply this: Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\, to me\\, is like finding out all the members of your favourite band have died (Luke\\, Han and Leia) but they're still going to carry on with the drummer (Chewbacca) and a trio of fresh talent (Rey\\, Finn\\, Poe) who you like\\, but it's just not your band anymore.","true":true}
