Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is trash from beginning to end. The writer\\director goes out of his way to spit on the original characters while undoing the consistency of the universe.\\nEpisode viii is an insult to the Skywalker legacy and an insult to all fans.\\nI really wish this movie was never made","true":true}
