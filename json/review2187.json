Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A terrible movie that pushed a liberal agenda as well as ruining cannon ideology\\, characters\\, and a lot of the basis ideas of the star wars universe. Mark Hamil spoke out in one interview about the horrible things they did to his character and i agree\\, star wars died when disney was given rights to it.","true":true}
