Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I did not care for it and I don't think it's really star wars any more.  It's some other Space franchise that uses characteristics of Star Wars as far as I'm concerned. They went out of their way to create a scene specifically to turn Chewbacca into a vegan without any further plot benefit. Why? Also\\, there's not enough justification in character development to make Luke suck as bad as he does in this film. The ship commander is basically an evil cartoon character (who gets angry when prank called--AND WHY is there a prank call in Star Wars???). It just doesn't resonate with me.","true":true}
