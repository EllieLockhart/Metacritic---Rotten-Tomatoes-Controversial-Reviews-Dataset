Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great ride through the Star Wars universe.  This was not the Star Wars movie I was looking for.  I went into this movie with all of the fan theories in my head about Rey's parents\\, Snoke's background\\, and how Luke was going to come back and set everyone straight\\, all while training Rey.  I had high expectations as well\\, critics were saying this was the best Star Wars since Empire.\\n\\nThis was a very different Star Wars movie.  It rejects all fan theories\\, and shows us our childhood hero depressed and set in his ways\\, and that he has nothing left to give.  This isn't my Luke Skywalker\\, Mr. Johnson!\\n  \\nWith that said\\, Rian Johnson has done a great job of breaking the mold of Star Wars\\, and in the process forces us to look at what happens to someone during the last days of their hero's journey.  He is also helping us step away from the Skywalker cycle.  It is painful at times.  The Skywalker's were my heroes\\, that does not mean they have to be or are my children's.  \\n\\nRey\\, Poe\\, and Finn are their heroes.   Like Luke\\, I need to leave my beliefs behind about how this all should go\\, and know that there are new great characters that will carry the torch of this franchise\\, expand what the force means\\, how it works\\, and will be the forces of good for a new generation.  I feel that this is a very strong chapter in the Star Wars saga.  I am not concerned about fuel shortages in these movies\\, and how we have never encountered this problem before\\, with bombs that fall in space\\, or a general\/princess that uses the force in a way that has never been seen before.  I do not go to these movies to get true sci-fi\\, I go to Star Wars to enjoy a space opera\\, and to see how things are faring in a galaxy far\\, far away where space wizards with light swords are the bearers of light against a very dark regime.  This movie provides me with the status update I need\\, challenged me\\, and at the same time allowed me to catch up with characters that I have loved since my childhood. It was a great ride\\, and I look forward to Episode 9!!!","true":true}
