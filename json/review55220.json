Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just awful. It's not that it's a bad standalone movie - it's not (even though there are some pretty horrific plot holes). But I grew up watching the original trilogy\\, and to see it disrespected like this is heartbreaking. Why were we told that the Skywalkers are so powerful because their bloodline is so strong with the force\\, only for an untrained nobody to be at least as powerful as a Skywalker descendant? I assume because Disney is looking to make money outside of just the Skywalkers. Why is Luke so unLuke? The hero we all loved became a bitter old man who even contemplated murder. When was space full an issue? Why not go into hyperspace as a way to destroy large empire\/first order (whatever) ships before? Why not give us a decent answer as to who Snoke is? He looks to be old enough to have been around during the original trilogy\\, yet we just learn of him now (well in the last movie) - best just kill him and remove that as an issue....job done. The list goes on. Help us JJ Abrams\\, you are our only hope!","true":true}
