Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From a pure movie\/story-telling perspective\\, this was scatterbrained and incoherent with egregious plot holes and plot devices. Characters were unlikable\\, few had clear purposes in the story\\, there was uncomfortably obvious social commentary pandering going on\\, and awkward attempts at humor.\\n\\nFrom a Star Wars universe perspective\\, it was equally bad. \\n\\nThey ruined Luke's character\\, they power crept the force into to a generic superpower like you'd see in the Marvel universe\\, and also made it so innate it that requires no training or discipline to learn to harness. \\n\\nSome of the visuals and ship design were stunning. Definitely had some great sci fi visual porn\\, but that was the only redeeming quality of the film.\\n\\nIt was so bad\\, it retroactively made me dislike The Force Awakens even more.","true":true}
