Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie looks great too bad that all the characters are one-dimensional and very predictable. Many parts of this movie we're completely unnecessary. The witty humor and one-liners really take away from the story. All of the premises used to further the story are weak . But visually it's a good-looking movie there by end it with something nice","true":true}
