Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably the biggest disappointment of the year. Massive plot holes and a lot of non landing jokes hold it back. With a complete disrespect of certain characters and laughable scenes makes you wonder if the director understands what makes Star Wars what it is. ","true":true}
