The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Having only played part 1 of this franchise about 3 years ago\\, i did not have to wait as long as a lot of other fans. Those 3 years were filled with pure excitement\\, anticipation and\\, of course\\, impatience. I absolutely loved part 1. It nestled its way close to my heart\\, and part 2 is no different. I put almost 32 hours into this game and I loved every single second of it. The story was nothing I could have ever expected. When they revealed that the doctor Joel had killed\\, was Abby's father I audibly gasped. I have smiled and shed tears throughout the whole game. Happiness and sadness were both prominent. Not to mention relief. I absolutely hated Ellie for leaving the farm\\, for leaving the seemingly perfect life she had with Dina and JJ\\, but I knew she had to go after Abby again. I felt it coming but still hated it. The Ellie boss fight was one of the hardest battles I had ever had to fight\\, or so I thought. The final fight against Abby certainly takes that spot. I cannot describe how desperate I was for Ellie to stop fighting. Every punch she landed made me sick to my stomach. I didn't want her to kill Abby so I just kept making her dodge Abby's punches\\, hoping the game would somehow sense that she\\, that I\\, didn't want any of this happening. Relief coursed through my body when Ellie stopped\\, realising that killing Abby would amount to an even greater loss. In the end\\, letting Abby live was what Ellie needed the most\\, which we can conclude when looking at Ellie's journal when she visits the farm again. This was one hell of a game and I applaud anyone involved in the making of it. No game\\, or any other type of media\\, is ever perfect but this game comes incredibly close. Here's to more games like this\\, and maybe a part 3 someday\\, please?\u2026 Expand","true":true}
