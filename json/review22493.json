Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Les sc\u00e8nes d'action sont bonnes mais les incoh\u00e9rences avec l'univers StarWars\\n et le non traitement des questions pos\u00e9es par l'episode Pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent ne l'inscrit pas dans la trilogie.\\nPire:\\nDes choix incoh\u00e9rents g\u00e2chent \u00e0 tout jamais ce qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 construit \\nQuel g\u00e2chis !!!!","true":false}
