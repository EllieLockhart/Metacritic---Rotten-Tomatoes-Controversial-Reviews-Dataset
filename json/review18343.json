Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this was a Good movie\\, but not Great.  I can see where some of the diehards are disappointed with things like Finn\/Rose\\, Princess Leia flying through space (that was a bit absurd) and Snoke\\, but overall I enjoyed the movie.  Great action scenes\\, I thought the movie flowed and new story lines were opened.","true":true}
