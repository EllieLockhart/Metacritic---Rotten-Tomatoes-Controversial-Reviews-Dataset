Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"There are few experiences in life that stick with you for a long time after you've passed them.

Out of those\\, only a handful affect you on such a deep level\\, that your outlook on life is changed forever. The Last of Us Part 2 is one of those experiences.\r\rThis is a game that has been controversial since its release\\, I am sure that many who play it will be angered\\, saddened and understandably frustrated. I sure was\\, however\\, this is not a usual story. Part 2 definitely took some risks\\, but I wholeheartedly believe that everything has a reason\\, and it definitely pays off in the end. This is a story centered around both the characters and several important lessons in morality and philosophy. The way I saw it\\, the events in the first game blend perfectly into this one. They are two sides of the same coin. Love and Hate\\, Hope and Despair\\, Salvation and destruction.\r\rThe gameplay and visuals are spectacular\\, there were many moments that I enjoyed because of this. It gave me the chance to take a lot of good pictures. The controls and gameplay are the same as The Last of Us 1\\, with tons of accessibility options that I appreciated. I think TLoU2 sets a new bar for expectations in the gaming industry. You can tell that a large group of passionate developers worked hard to bring us a story that will stay with us for a long time. Having said this\\, I also think some people will not like the choices in the story.\r\r**SPOILERS FROM HERE**\r\rI think that Abby was a very well written character with strong and justifiable motivations. Her journey in the beginning of the game to get revenge on Joel is perfectly reflected on Ellie's journey to hunt her down. They are both fueled by grief they believe will only be cured once they accomplish their goal. No matter how much pain they cause to the people around them. Jesse\\, Dina\\, Tommy\\, Manny\\, Mel\\, Owen. They all were dragged into a battle between two unstoppable and determined forces of destruction. Playing the game from Abby's point of view is not a cheap way to make the players sympathize with her\\, it shows us how anyone can go through pain. Her journey with Lev somehow reflects how as anyone will go to far lengths for revenge\\, they will do the same thing for love.\r\rThis is the main lesson of The Last of Us 2\\, there are no protagonists or villains in real life. Everyone is trying to live their life the best way they can. I applaud this game for taking this path\\, giving us a depressing but thoughtful ending that hopefully provides a great example for storytelling in the future. I think anyone should give The Last of Us Part 2 a playthrough and form their own conclusion\\, for me it is one of the best games of the generation.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
