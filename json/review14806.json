Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have to rank this as slightly better than The Phantom Menace and overall pretty disappointed with this movie.  One user review put it best for me\\, it feels like a bad beer commercial\\, where something serious is said\\, and then some poor attempt at humor immediately follows it up pretty much throughout the entire movie.","true":true}
