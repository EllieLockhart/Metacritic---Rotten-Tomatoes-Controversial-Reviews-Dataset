Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a real disappointment with MANY themes.  I think if you wanted it to make a new movie you should make it new\\, but you don't need to throw shade so completely on the previous movies.  And the beer toward animal appreciation was so on the nose\\, it got me agitated.  No problem at all with a female lead.\\n\\nThe real issue is that Rogue One was sooooo good.  You can't believe the 'main' Star Wars story line was so lacking in story.  Trips back and forth between two planets\\, and Luke walking up and down some volcanic island is just bizarre.  Also\\, very little scrambling around trying to make due.","true":true}
