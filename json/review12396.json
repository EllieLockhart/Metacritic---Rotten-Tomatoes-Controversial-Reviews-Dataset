Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I (big star wars fan) really enjoyed this movie.\\nrian johnson made star wars new and fresh again.\\ni think the movie is that great\\, because you cant foresee the plot twist.if you're a real star wars fan you will have fun watching it.","true":true}
