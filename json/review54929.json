Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's obvious Rian Johnson either never watched Star Wars or had a secret agenda to ruin it. I say this because SW - is- about Luke\\, whether Johnson (and Disney) like it or not.  I spent Episode 7 waiting for Luke\\, Episode 8 gave us Luke but turned him into a different person just to have him die a pointless death. I now have no interest in Episode 9.\\nThis was slow\\, bloated\\, and full of misplaced juvenile humor that had no place in a Star Wars movie.  This simply did not feel like a SW movie at all.\\nPoe was I guess the new Han\\, but he was obnoxious\\, impudent\\, and a complete ass (not to mention that cringe worthy opening scene). Finn and Rose had no real business in this movie but to extend what should have been a shorter movie and satisfy certain demographics with pointless and incompetent characters who made absolutely no difference to the movie. Don't get me started on Phasma's 2 minute cameo\/death scene. \\n\\nI'll watch Episode 9... on streaming.","true":true}
