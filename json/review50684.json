Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"85% of this movie was a really slow car chase in space.  The car being chased was the family station wagon where mom and dad decided to argue about who was the better driver while being chased.  It went on so long that the kids had time to leave the car chase\\, go to Vegas\\, pick up a stranger and come back to the car chase having missed nothing.","true":true}
