Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Whiny fanboys\\, despite the obvious flaws that film was amazing. Not just the visuality but the complexity. I can relate with Kylo than I've ever did with Darth Vader. And Luke I loved his portraying as an old man. \\n\\nRian Johnson\\, you have my respect.","true":true}
