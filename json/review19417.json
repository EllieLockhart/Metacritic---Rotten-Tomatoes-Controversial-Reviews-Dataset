Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its's pretty good\\, I'm not a sleep like most people who only saw the movie one time. The film is great with really small details that I actually missed. The things that fell flat are the jokes and the structure of this movie wasn't that focused. Overall I had a blast with TLJ and a worthy addition to the saga.","true":true}
