Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite great performances and some truly great moments\\, this film felt like a huge mess to me. Too many unnecessary subplots makes the film feel bloated and alot of weird decisions. Still hats off to Rian Johnson for taking risks that another director wouldn't have taken\\, even if not all of the risks pay off.","true":true}
