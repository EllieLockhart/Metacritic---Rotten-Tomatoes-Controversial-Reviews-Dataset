Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing. There's much to say\\, but that would involve spoilers\\, so let's just say that there's a lot of very weak writing. Some great character development for some\\, very little for others\\, and some very nonsensical pot elements. Frustrated enough that I created an account just to share this on RT.","true":true}
