Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are moments of star wars fun to be had for sure  but overall this film was very confusing. The plot felt muddled and some of them felt unnecessary and contrived. There were a couple of cringeworthy moments too! Overall it felt bizarre and not like a star wars movie at all. After waiting 30 years it was very disappointing. I hope Disney can produce something more worthy in the future.","true":true}
