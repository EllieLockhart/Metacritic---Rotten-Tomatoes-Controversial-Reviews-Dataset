Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a huge Star Wars fan and was excited to see TLJ. However\\, I have to agree with many of the other audience reviews and say I was immensely disappointed when I left the theater. The humor was forced and often silly. SJW themes throughout. Characters from TFA were not developed any further in this movie. I could go on and on...The worst though was how Lukes character was portrayed. Hamill made the most with what he was given\\, but the Luke in this movie is entirely inconsistent with original trilogy. WTF is all I can say after seeing this.","true":true}
