Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hated it.  \\n\\nFor the many many reasons others have stated:\\nPlot inconsistencies\\, meaningless\/boring storylines\\, the whole 'Snoke cannot be betrayed thing' and then he IS!... And dies really easily... \\n\\nKylo Ren's attitude just reminds me of when I was 12 and my Mum wouldn't let me go to the cinema after my bedtime - A whiny spoilt brat Millennial.  \\nEqually\\, Rey is irritating and seems to be much more powerful than Luke which makes no sense.  \\n\\nFinally\\, how they changed Luke's character and turned the world's most optimistic and popular protagonist into someone who had given up on life and the way he tossed his lightsaber over his head like it was nothing - This one fact ruined the whole film for me.  \\n\\nIt was WAY too long\\, there was awkward stupid humour\\, and the way Disney pretend to care about sending an anti-capitalist\/ethical message when the only reason they made this film is to get a PROFIT! \\nGeorge Lucas wanted to tell a STORY - NOT sell a franchise.  That's the difference.  \\n\\nAs Mark Hamill said:\\n\\\"Remember kids\\, it's not important if it's of good quality\\, only if it MAKES MONEY\\\"\\n\\nThe 'Audience score' v.s. the 'Top critics' score says everything... I think Russia may have got some bots to help Disney out for this film.  \\n\\n\\nPoor Luke.   \\n\\nThis film makes the prequels look like Gold.","true":true}
