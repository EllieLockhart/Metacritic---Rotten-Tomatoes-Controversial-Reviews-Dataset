Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They seem to use a lot of plot ideas from the original trilogy. There are also a ton of plot holes and moments that leave you shaking your head asking \\\"why?\\\" I thought we would at least learn who Snoke is or what the significance of Phasma was...truly a giant let down.","true":true}
