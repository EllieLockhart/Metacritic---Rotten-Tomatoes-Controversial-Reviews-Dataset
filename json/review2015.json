Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As someone who enjoyed The Force Awakens\\, The Last Jedi was ultimately pretty disappointing\\, with totally wasted potential from certain characters\\, a poorly written script\\, and too many unlikable characters!","true":true}
