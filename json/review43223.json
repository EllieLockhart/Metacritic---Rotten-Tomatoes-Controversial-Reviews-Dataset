Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This Star Wars was a complete disgrace to all original characters. Luke Skywalker and Yoda would never want the Force and Jedi to end. The \\\"humor\\\" was terrible and awkward. No fan wants to see Luke Skywalker milk and alien and drink it from a Nike bottle. We do not want to see Yoda burn the books of the Jedi. We do not want to see Luke die a pointless death. We do not want to see Leia and Han's child be such a blubbering baby. And we do not want to see a random\\, no name be able to use the Force and become a Jedi with NO TRAINING. We do not want to see Leia fly like Mary Poppins through space. She deserves more. There is NO coming back from the last two installments of Star Wars. In my opinion they don't exist.","true":true}
