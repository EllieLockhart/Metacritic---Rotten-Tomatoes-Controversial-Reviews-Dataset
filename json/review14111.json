Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you think that the critics are portraying their actual opinions on this film and this certified fresh score is accurate you are simply out of your mind. It is entirely possible they saw a different edit before it was dumbed down for the mass markets. But the film I saw was not entertaining. This film is cringy throughout\\, constantly undercuts tension with cheap humor\\, and it is constantly explaining the situation and plot to the viewers. I'm really worried about the future of this franchise.","true":true}
