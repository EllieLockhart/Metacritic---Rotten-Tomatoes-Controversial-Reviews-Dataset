Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was pretty bad. With all the hype and great critic ratings\\, makes me wonder how many of them were either paid off or forced to say good things to continue to get invited to opening events. I am now really worried about the trilogy that Rian J has been signed on to do. The Mary Poppins Leia moment was one of the worst","true":true}
