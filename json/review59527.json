Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I cannot understand the disappointment of the players.the graphics and game mechanics are great. the story and characters have been implemented very\\, very well. don't listen to the hater but make your own picture. Worth it! I warn here again about spoilers! So don't read on if you haven't finished the game.The story is amazing. told very emotional and great.Many complain about Joel's death. but I think his part is just finished. he is old and has told his story. I also found it appropriate to play Abby\\, because you could see everything from her perspective and understood why she did it.this gives the story a moral struggle. on the one hand you want to kill with ellie Abby on the other hand you want to keep abby alive. Abby is actually very emotional and personable. it was very hard to see them fighting ... mega! i can't understand the hatred for abby. all this hatred of abby and the developers are not good. let people live as they want!thank you for this game\\, thank you for this experience.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
