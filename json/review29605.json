Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson\u2019s attempt to continue the Star Wars franchise was weak at best. A poorly written script translated to cheesy dialogue\\, forced Star Wars nostalgia\\, and a whole lot of clich\u00e9s. The abundance of subplots made the actual storyline very unclear- on top of the fact that the film was entirely too long to keep my interest.","true":true}
