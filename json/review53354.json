Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite some truly exciting and wonderful moments\\, the Last Jedi seems to want to forge it's own path in an almost arrogant manner. Characters set up in the Force Awakens are either ignored completely or sent sideways in unsatisfying ways\\, all for the purpose of forcing a story that should have taken it's time and eased more gracefully into episode XI. Overall TLJ is a fun\\, yet frustrating addition to this trilogy. Hopefully JJ Abrams can bring the story full circle and answer the remaining questions with greater satisfaction.","true":true}
