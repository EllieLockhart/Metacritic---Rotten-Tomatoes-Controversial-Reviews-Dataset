Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really tired of politics getting shoved down my throat\\, and why on earth would you bring back the original cast just to off them? The new characters do not resonate with me at all. To me stars wars stopped being Canon the moment Lucas handed the rights to disney. Disney is more interested in pushing political propaganda than simply making a good film that respects the stories that came before it. I am not watching anymore disney. I have the originals. The ones that matter.","true":true}
