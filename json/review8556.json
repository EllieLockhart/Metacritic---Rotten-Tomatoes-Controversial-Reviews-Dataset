Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First lets start by just confirming I am no Bot\\, second how come the audience score has not dropped\\, there have been so many half star and 1 star reviews lately\\, but the the audience score has not budged\\, for the past 4 days!\\nThirdly\\, I would like to point out that the very latest 4-5 star reviews seem to be very short\\, as though someone created an account\\, just to give a positive review\\, and they dont seem to say anything about the film...  All very suspicious.  To cap it all off\\, you have the critic\\, reviews who really should not be in their jobs\\, if they seem to think this monstrosity is any good.  Money talks as they say.\\nAnyway back to the film\\, what can i say which hasnt been said.  It just doesnt make any sense.  You now have a main character who can go to toe with Luke Skywalker\\, even betters him\\, all without any training.  You have irrelevant side quests and characters\\, the Casino and codebreaker plot\\, which you could remove from the film\\, and it would make a slight bit of difference.  An irrelevant character\\, who no one cares about.. Rose.\\nKilled off the main villain\\, killed off Luke Skywalker.  Leia should have died\\, but somehow can now survive after death\\, in space aswell may i add.\\nThis trilogy is no trilogy\\, there is nothing to look forward to in episode 9.  Rey has already beaten Kylo\\, has not had any setbacks in her journey\\, and is super powerful.  There just isnt anything to look forward to.  Go to hell disney and Rian Johnson\\, and take this garbage with you........FAIL!","true":true}
