Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fun to watch but couldn't respect it in the morning. Can forgive plot-contrived boring adventures and the deliberately-withheld info that made them possible\\, or even\\, SuperLeia\\, but it was anticlimactic with so many missed opportunities (for a moment\\, we thought we were about to have a really great climax that would make up for being cheated out of a cool mentor\/student relationship and training story) but eh\\, what a let-down.","true":true}
