Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know why there is a backlash to this movie. Rian Johnson did a spectacular job with this film\\, I fell that he develop the character's very well to a point where I got to know them better. I love the story as well\\, it was a surprise in a good way because it now leaves even bigger questions out there for us to seek an answer. The film also presented the conflict of good vs. evil in a way that I have never thought of before. Great film!","true":true}
