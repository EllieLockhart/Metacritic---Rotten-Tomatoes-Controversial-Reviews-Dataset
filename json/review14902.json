Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just signed up to give my 2 cents. It's not about fanboyism. Poor and lazy writing\\, shoehorned \\\"comedy\\\"\\, wasted characters and opportunities\\, filler plot\\, cartoony villains and disrespect of lore. I actually liked the resolution of rey's theories but on the big scope anything makes sense.","true":true}
