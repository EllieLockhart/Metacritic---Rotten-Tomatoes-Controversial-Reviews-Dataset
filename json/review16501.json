Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I must admit I had some mixed feeling about The Last Jedi when I watched it for the first time. Luke Skywalker is my favorite character. I grew up with him so he's my hero. No one wants to see their heroes fail. A lot of time has passed since we saw Luke. Ultimately you have a film about Kylo Ren and Rey. These two characters are at the center\\, but The Last Jedi is about Luke. This story explores the emotional wreckage from the fallow of Luke Skywalker and Ben Solo. \\n\\nIn a New Hope\\, Obi-Wan has had to digest his failure with Anakin Skywalker for twenty years. In The Last Jedi\\, Luke has been in isolation for a handful of years. It's not easy seeing Luke so different at first\\, but this help explains why he doesn't come to the rescue in The Force Awakens. Once I came to that realization that it's obvious Luke detached himself from the galaxy everything else clicked into place. \\nI've seen the film now countless time and it's clear that Rian Johnson wrote one of the best Star Wars scripts ever. My only gripes about the film were kind of out of his control. I look forward to what he does with his own story.","true":true}
