Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I felt like I had already seen this movie\\, but it was called \\\"Spaceballs\\\" by Mel Brooks. Honestly\\, I've never laughed so hard at a Star Wars film\\, but that's not a good thing. There was a your mamma joke during the prank phone call scene. It was an abomination what happened to Luke. #notmystarwars","true":true}
