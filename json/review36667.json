Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is mire original than the Force awakens because it has it's own signture\\, it's own way of telling the story of this new generation taking over the lead while the older one is steping aside and teaching the new gen the way things are. Luke was a very opmistic caracter but because of his great mistake of not helping Ben to resist the dark side and losing everything he becames sad and full of regret\\, until he learns with his mistakes and realizes   what he had done and faces his mistakes. The downsides of this mivie were the Finn and Rose ark was a little bit insignificant to the main plot but it helps to develop the caracters and SOMETIMES comedy gets in the way but people forget that this is star wars nit a greety war movie.","true":true}
