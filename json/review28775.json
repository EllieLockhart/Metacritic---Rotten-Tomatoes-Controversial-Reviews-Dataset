Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Quite possibly the most disappointing film of 2017. The plot is a mess\\, the characters are weak. All of the recent \\\"Disney\\\" Star Wars films have been hollow shells of the ones that we grew up with\\, but this one is the worst yet. The Last Jedi could have been one of the greatest films in the series\\, but instead it is a transparent cash grab. I probably won't bother any of the next ones\\, as long as Disney owns LucasFims. Sad day for Star Wars fans.","true":true}
