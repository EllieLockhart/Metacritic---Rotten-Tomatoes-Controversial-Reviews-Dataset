Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The characters Ren and Rey are compelling in this version of Star Wars. Rose\\, I could hardly hear thee. The action scenes were good. Luke\\, looking back at his life\\, is a do over\\, as he seemed to agree\\, he was not a good teacher. I did deserve to be left alone. Even Yoda's appearance put Luke \\\"in his place\\\" again. Luke was never equal or near Yoda. Since the dead Jedi's can come back\\, we can see Anakin\\, Luke\\, Obi One anytime in the future. Ren is \\\"for real\\\" now and can put away that stupid mask. They killed off Snork. Good\\, since thats a pretty dumb name for a Supreme Leader. Star Wars is entertaining. I went right home and watched the old movies on TNT. The Star Wars writers have to be kicking themselves killing off Luke and keeping Lea (and Carrie Fisher is dead). Thor's latest film is more fun to watch.","true":true}
