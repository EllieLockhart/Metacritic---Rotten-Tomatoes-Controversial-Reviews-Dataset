Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"worse than the prequels. glad they didnt use cgi for yoda and when rey and kylo took on snoke's guards...but that's where the good stuff ends. the audience i saw it with started laighing when leia started flying after she was blown into space. they should have let her die the\\, especially because the actress died. it would have given luke reason to get back into the fight\\, and would let kylo either turn to the dark side or have a chance at redemption.","true":true}
