Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"RIP Starwars. This film killed all the mythology\\, all the built story in 6 films about the Skylwalker family. Luke didn't deserve this end. Disney is just looking for a lucrative film every year\\, it doesn't care if fans like it or not. Disney is just looking for new audiences\\, young people who don't understand the mimic these films bought to older generation. The directors just wanted to introduce new characters using the fame of old lovely ones\\, killing them one at a time in each movie. Unfortunately\\, the new characters are not cool or likable like the old ones. I'm super surprised that all the critics loved this film\\, I kind of think about the powerful Disney paying for likes to the critics. I feel sad about Star Wars and how the director killed years of hard work in a simple movie. For the first time\\, I'm not interested in watching the next Star Wars movie.","true":true}
