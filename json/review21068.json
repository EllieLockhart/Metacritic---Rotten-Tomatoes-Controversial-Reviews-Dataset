Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was satisfied with every character in the movie. Thought the plot was a little slow at the start but it really got going at the end. Mark Hamil gave his best on screen performance yet as luke skywalker. Carrie fisher\\, rest in peace princess\\, was amazing in this movie. Adam driver was great\\, overall I enjoyed the movie and it definitely makes my top 3 star wars movies.","true":true}
