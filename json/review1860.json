Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A shell shock in the star wars canon and from the previous episode 7 installment. It's like the writer of this film hates JJ Abrams\\, or is so self absorbed to care what anyone else thinks. Character development is too fast\\, and lacks depth and emotional connection. Is this amateur hour at Disney? Special Effects are great! Music is fantastic! Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill are always brilliant in Star Wars.","true":true}
