Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed all the twists in this movie. Maybe it didn't live up to the Star Wars \\\"brand\\\" that many people expect to see\\, but that was the main reason I enjoyed it. It continued to add much needed \\\"grey\\\" to the black and white to the galaxy much as Rogue One did. And while the plot did feel uneven at times because of major plot twists\\, I thought they were worth it on balance for a more thoughtful movie. Maybe they just needed to be shorter for the main story arc? The kid in me wishes that the saber battles were better choreographed. And when is Rey gonna get darth maul saber that fits her character's natural training? I hope they're saving that for 9!","true":true}
