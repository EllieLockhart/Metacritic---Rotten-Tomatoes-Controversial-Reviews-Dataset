Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*Edited from the original* - NOTICE MOST IF NOT ALL OF THE 5 STAR REVIEWS (when you click on them) GO TO PAGES THAT \\\"ARE NOT FOUND\\\" but when you click on the bad ones they are real people. ITS A FKN RACKET! \\n\\nOriginal Review: Member' when Star Wars movies were more about substance and plot than pretty colors and slap-stick humor? I can't believe we went from Rogue One (possibly my favorite Star Wars movie ever) to this heaping pile of garbage. The only reason I would even contemplate ever watching it again is so that I can make a 10 page list of all the things I hated about it. Literally there are so many layers of suck in this movie that I even\\, until about 10 minutes ago\\, completely forgot about the Casino scene. The only reason I am not telling all of my friends not to see a movie they have waited 2 years for is because\\, for some reason\\, I want them to endure the same pain that I just witnessed. I don't want to feel all alone here in the fetal position after trying to wash the stench off in my shower. This movie is the Crystal Skull of the Star Wars franchise.","true":true}
