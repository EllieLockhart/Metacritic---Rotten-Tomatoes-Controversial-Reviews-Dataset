Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was keeping a running tally of the number of cringeworthy moments in this film\\, but I lost count at 12. There was still an hour of film left.\\n\\nI feel completely betrayed as a Star Wars fan. Enough with the forced jokes and cringy one-liners (yes folks\\, the first scene of this film involves a repackaged 'yo momma' joke and sounds like the beginning of a Verizon commercial). Enough with the re-hashed scenes\\, useless characters\\, and 'twists' that are on the verge of lunacy rather than anything founded in the Star Wars universe. 'The Force' is NOT a blank check for you reconcile anything you want! \\n\\nThere's something woefully wrong when commanders of the First Order are cracking jokes a few rooms away from Snoke\\, and members of The Rebellion are having kissy time while the remaining few of their group are on the verge of being wiped clean. There are other much more obvious examples\\, but I'll save sharing those on the off chance that anyone actually decides to go see this movie.\\n\\nThe viewer gets the impression that the new era of actors are high on the line of coke that is the original trilogy\\, while the actors from the original trilogy are more than content taking the backseat - the ultimate clash of overdone and passive acting of any movie I've seen\\, and no\\, they don't balance each other. (General Leia Organa literally has a line where she states \\\"Well what are you lookin' at me for?\\\"). Not leadership\\, apparently. \\n\\nNonetheless\\, I'm thankful for seeing the movie - if nothing than as a form of non-validation. Its confirmed that the Star Wars universe deserves so much more than Disney or the directors and producers they contract could ever give it. I had so much Hope for the new Star Wars movies. But like all good things\\, I suppose it too has burned in the fires of Mustafar.","true":true}
