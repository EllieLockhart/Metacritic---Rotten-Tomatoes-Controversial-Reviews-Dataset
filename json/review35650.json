Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is an emotionally complex\\, deeply philosophical movie with great lightsaber duels\\, spaceship dogfights\\, and actual humor. Yeah\\, it's REALLY that good. Anchored by some truly remarkable performances\\, and a host of good to great ones\\, the people are both more believable and more important than the effects\\, and the effects are amazing . Mark Hamill's turn as Luke Skywalker will be on my list of best performances of the year: he is funny\\, heart breaking\\, and legendary\\, it is the best acting this series has ever seen. Carrie Fisher's performance is wonderful\\, but the tragedy of her loss was impossible for me to separate\\, but it is a perfect farewell if it is her last appearance. The new heroes and villains carry the story and make it clear that the Force is still with Star Wars and the rebellion. If you don't love this movie\\, you don't like Star Wars\\, you like the Star Wars you have in your head not the one that exists. A great movie on its own terms\\, The Last Jedi is without question either the best\\, or alongside The Empire Strikes Back\\, one of the best this series has given us. I can not wait to see it again and again","true":true}
