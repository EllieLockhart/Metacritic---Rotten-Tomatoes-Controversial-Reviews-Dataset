Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Slight Spoilers\\n\\nAn absolutely perfect addition to the Star Wars canon! If there was ever an doubt about the quality of this film\\, it is no longer in question.\\n\\n With its long length\\, this film beautifully develops almost every single character. Poe grows into a more seasoned\\, and realistic\\, tactician and fighter in the war between the Resistance and the First Order. Rey finds her own path\\, not being defined by Luke or her parents\\, and Kylo steps into his own\\, not trying to be like his grandfather or Supreme Leader Snoke. \\n\\nThis film\\, unlike all others before it\\, which is also undoubtedly the reason people are so grumpy about it\\, takes bold\\, shocking risks. As the movie goes on\\, you don't know where it is going at all. Jaw-dropping secrets lay within this film\\, be careful of spoilers! \\n\\nAll in all\\, a completely original\\, perfect addition to the Star Wars canon that finally introduces mortal ambiguity and the wight of war upon its characters while making a jaunty\\, fun ride of the dark story. This is the film that hands the reigns to a new generation and succeeds as the best film since Empire.","true":true}
