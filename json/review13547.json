Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I feel sorry for these folks who couldn\u2019t come to terms with the evolution of this series. A life-long SW fan - I was immensely satisfied. It was superb. The best SW film since the original trilogy. Deep\\, insightful and enlightened. Brilliant performance by everyone - Especially Mark Hamill and the incomparable Carrie Fisher.
