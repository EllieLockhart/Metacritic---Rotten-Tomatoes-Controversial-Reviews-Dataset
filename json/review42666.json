Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was fantastic. It is darker than TFA\\, and the outlook in general for the light side is bleak. Rian Johnson did a great job of making each of the characters feel human and shows that the Star Wars story can be about more than one family.","true":true}
