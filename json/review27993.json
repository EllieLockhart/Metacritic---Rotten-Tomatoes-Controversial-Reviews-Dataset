Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot holes\\, bad side story (Finn\\, Rose)\\, political messages and a lack of respect of the older characters. It also takes too much freedom with how the force works\\, it's basically a Deus ex machina at this point. Star Wars is dead.","true":true}
