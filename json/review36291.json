Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The longest SW movie to date\\, and the nearly the whole time I was wondering just how long it was going to take. Plodding pacing\\, irrelevant subplots\\, character assassination of Luke Skywalker\\, and new characters that range between \\\"I can't stand them\\\" and \\\"I couldn't care less about them.\\\" I'd call this film a maggot infested pile of crap\\, but that'd be unnecessarily disrespectful to maggot infested piles of crap.","true":true}
