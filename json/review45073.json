Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"UNDERWHELMING. Any other movie I would have given maybe 3 stars. But this is flippin Star Wars! It wasted the characters and plot points introduced in TFA\\, instead introducing more minor characters. The story meandered and is ultimately very boring the first half\\, with a slight pickup towards the end\\, but still a lame ending. The music was extremely lackluster\\, only stereotypical orchestra music with nothing memorable. And there was no true one-on-one lightsaber fighting! Overall disappointed in the wasted potential.","true":true}
