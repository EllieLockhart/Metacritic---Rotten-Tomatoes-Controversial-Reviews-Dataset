Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Weak characters\\, no pre established cannon for character changes and plot holes that break the Star Wars universe. In a word\\, don't see it if you are a Star Wars fan of the originals or prequels","true":true}
