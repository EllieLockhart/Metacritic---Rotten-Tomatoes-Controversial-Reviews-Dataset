Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Right amount of humor\\, action\\, suspension\\, and surprise. I believe it follows Lucas's vision. Too bad R2D2 and C3P0 are relegated to the side lines\\, since the story is supposed to be narrated by them.","true":true}
