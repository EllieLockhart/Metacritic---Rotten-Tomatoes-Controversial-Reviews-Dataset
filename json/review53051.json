Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Aside from the giant plot holes created by completely ignoring EVERYTHING the force awakens built upon and taking a giant dump on the legacy of Luke Skywalker it was still a sub par scifi action flick. They slapped in a 3rd movie ending to the second movie in the series just so they could kill off Luke. Literally every question I was left with after TFA was answered in the most half a$$ed way possible.\\n\\nWho is Snoke? Nobody\\nWho are Reys parent's? Nobody\\nWill Luke train Rey to fight the first Order? Half A$$ed\\nWhy does Anakins lightsaber call to Rey? No Reason\\n\\nWhen Luke threw his father's lightsaber over his shoulder I didn't know he was also throwing away every plot point  from TFA over his shoulder also. Two years of waiting and Disney couldn't even answer the plot questions they created. As a life long fan this will be the last SW I watch in theaters i was so disappointed.","true":true}
