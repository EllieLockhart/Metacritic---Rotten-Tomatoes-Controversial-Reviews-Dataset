Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Parts of the movie were great.  Luke\\, Rey\\, Kylo and Finn all had strong showings.  The logic and physics rules for the space battle scenes were absurd.  The entire Poe story didn't make much sense.  The casino detour was a real WTF moment.  Some great stuff woven in with lots of crap.","true":true}
