Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had some great moments\\, but that wasn't enough to make up for all the flaws in its pacing and storytelling. It was an hour too long with subplots that could have been dropped entirely\\, while failing to address so many of the subplots that had been opened in the Force Awakens. I did enjoy some aspects of this film\\, but I also found myself constantly asking when it would be over from 1\/3 of the way in. I'd love to see a super cut of this film that focuses only on Rey\\, Luke and Kylo Ren\\, and leaves out everything else. This movie only gets a pass from me because of how well some of those core scenes worked.","true":true}
