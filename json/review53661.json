Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Force fed a pile of forceshit!!! I feel like I'm on crazy pills...hey \\\"critics\\\" how much did Mickey Mouse pay all of you to bend over and take it? The Last Jedi leads to anger\\, anger leads to hate\\, hate leads to 2 1\/2 hours of suffering. The plot doesn't advance at all. The whole film is filled with non characters. A bloated non story for fidget spinning moviegoers. JJ lobbed Rian a home run and this film whiffs on all fronts.","true":true}
