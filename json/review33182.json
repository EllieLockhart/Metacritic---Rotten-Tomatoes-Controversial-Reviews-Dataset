Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such a great Star Wars Movie. Made me love Star Wars all over again. The characters are amazing and I felt like I was in the battles with the Resistance. I want to see this a thousand times. Just like the originals!","true":true}
