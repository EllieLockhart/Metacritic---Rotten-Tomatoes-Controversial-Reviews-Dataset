Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A terrible film hiding behind the Star Wars franchise. A messy\\, bloated slow moving plot\\, out of place humour that is slapstick at time\\, cheap furry around the edges blue screen special effects\\, no continuity in the cinematography - the colour is all over the place\\, throw away characters and not a single \\\"gasp\\\" payoff moment! A complete waste that took me from excitement to couldn't care less about Episode 9! All I can say is good luck fixing up this mess J.J.","true":true}
