{"101487":191207,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Usually I never watch spoilers of a movie before going to see it\\, but the fan blowback of The Last Jedi was so swift and severe that I ended up delving deep into a YouTube hole and watched dozens of spoiler-filled reviews prior to seeing it yesterday evening... It grieves me to say\\, but the naysayers are right on this film. There are so many reasons be disappointed\\, from the completely abandoned potential story arcs laid by the Force Awakens (namely Ray's lineage and Snokes' back-story)\\, to the dismissive manner in which core characters are treated by the screenwriters. It's almost as if the director had never seen a Star Wars movie prior\\, and had zero understanding of what made the films powerful\\, and the characters and overarching themes timeless. It's a clich\u00e9 at this point\\, but the Finn\/Rose story arc was dreadful in every respect. The movie fared pretty well (Superman Laya aside) until this point\\, but it went off the rails hard and fast with ham-fisted commentaries on wealth\\, inequality\\, war profiteering\\, slavery\\, and animal cruelty. All this overt messaging would be excusable if the plot was engaging throughout this section\\, but it was boring\\, tacky\\, and simply awful in every respect. Finn's schtick is wearing a bit thin as it is\\, he has a penchant for overacting like he's in some type of Broadway stage performance. Though I enjoyed aspects of the film\\, much of the movie felt like an empty exercise\\, exacerbated by the pain of watching Luke Skywalker wallow in misery and self doubt\\, clearly a hollow shell of the man we all came to know and love... I heard it said that if you LIKE Star Wars\\, you'll like the movie\\, but if you LOVE Star Wars\\, you'll HATE it. That sentiment hits the mark\\, and judging by the audience score on Rotten Tomatoes\\, clearly 45% of viewers have a deep an abiding love for what made Star Wars great originally\\, and we hold out hope that Disney will be able to capture that magic once again. After all\\, until The Last Jedi\\, hope against all odds was the defining characteristic of the Jedi.","true":true}
