Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I guess I'm a bot.  I don't review much\\,  but I felt I needed to say I didn't like it.    The movie urself wasn't the worst movie of the series\\, but at the end you're left with less you be excited about for the future than ever.  \\n\\nThere were scenes that may have been exciting\\, but for every one good scene\\, there were 2 bad ones. \\n\\nThe reason posting this is because of a thought I had of why I didn't like it.   Phantom menace was a worse movie\\, with less redeemable moments in the movie\\, but at the end\\, there was still stuff to look forward to like the eventual grown up Anikin Skywalker betraying the Jedi\\, obi wan\\, Yoda\\, mace windu\\, the Emporer's rise.... what you just saw was bad\\, but it'll lead to something good. Here\\, it's less bad\\, but I'm not looking forward to the future.    I find the characters of Rey and Kylo to be bland.  Finn is pointless\\,  Poe is bad\\,  Carrie Fisher is dead RIP.... there's nothing left.   Kinda wish I never saw it too be honest.","true":true}
