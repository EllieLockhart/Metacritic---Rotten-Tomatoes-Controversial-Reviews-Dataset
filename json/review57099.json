Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is an extremely disappointing film that I imagine anyone with some sort of respect for the prior films in the Saga will loathe. Kids and adults that don't know anything about Luke Skywalker prior to this film might enjoy it if they don't mind watching mindless action and constant one-liner comedy. Overall\\, it was very terrible and sad that it will go down in Star Wars film history.\\n\\nThere are some surprises in the film that at first might look like a setup for an interesting twist\\, but I quickly realized these were just odd directions for the film to take that leave you questioning the intended theme of the film and the writer's choices. Like they were trying too hard to create something other than what you wanted to see.\\n\\nAnother issue I had very early on with this film was blatantly laying out the problem the protagonists had to deal with. The characters say\\, oh oh--X is going to happen. We have a solution though--Y\\, so that's how we will fix it. The mystery and enjoyment from just sitting back and seeing where the film takes you is sucked out at that point. There was nothing interesting about how they go about solving this problem\\, so you're left watching for two hours as people run around so that this goofy plot point can come to some resolution. Meanwhile\\, insert all kinds of meaningless subplots\\, awkward character lines and actions\\, and the dullest cinematography of any Star Wars movie (think the first Alien + Casino Royale).\\n\\nThere are many \\\"twists\\,\\\" but not in a surprising\/interesting sort of way since they are mainly just showing confused characters that don't really know where their allegiance is so they flop back and forth tirelessly. Eventually I wasn't sure where the allegiances were and I stopped caring\\, because the characters became so spineless and contrived that I could no longer relate to them as a person. Of course\\, I'm mainly talking about our Jedi types here\\, which is actually where the only good parts of the film came from. There are a few scenes that introduce something new and clever that you think might lead to something interesting\\, but ultimately they don't and you are cringing and burying your face in your hands again. Ultimately the whole story of this episode is meager and pointless to the Star Wars universe. The Force Awakens left us with a very exciting cliffhanger\\, Luke standing before a Jedi-hopeful with his old lightsaber. The possibilities were endless. At the end of The Last Jedi there is no cliffhanger at all. They made many characters less interesting and dishonored some great classic characters (Luke) and actually set up a scenario that requires no follow-up at all. I don't care what happens to anyone that's left in the Star Wars universe anymore and probably won't see Episode IX. It's incredible how Disney truly ruined Star Wars with this film.","true":true}
