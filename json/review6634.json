Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Do NOT waste your time. Terrible (read: zero) plot\\, so many awkward attempts at humor that fail\\, bad writing and worse acting. This is just an anti-male\\, social justice diatribe that preaches down to you for almost 3 hours. Any chance of restoring the franchise to greatness is lost.","true":true}
