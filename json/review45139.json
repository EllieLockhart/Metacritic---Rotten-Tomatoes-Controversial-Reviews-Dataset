Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unfortunately one of my least favorite in the series. Scenes felt disjointed\\, characters were misused\\, and the characters that built the foundation of this franchise were not represented as we have grown to know them. I'm trying to write this without using spoilers and it's challenging.  It's worth seeing once but only for the purpose on continuing the story. Don't expect to be blown away.","true":true}
