Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was refreshing take on Star Wars and I enjoyed that I couldn\u2019t guess what was going to happen next\\, some scenes I definitely didn\u2019t like\\, interesting movie and I\u2019m very interested in where they take it from here.","true":true}
