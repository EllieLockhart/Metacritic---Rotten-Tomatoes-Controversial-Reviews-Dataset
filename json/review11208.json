Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly\\, if people were being honest with themselves and judged the movie without seeing the critics the \\\"professional\\\" critics put. They would aggree it makes ZERO sense and it is a joke to the whole star wars universe. They ruined the franchise with 1)so many forced comic relief moments eg the coin thing with bb fucking eight.  2)C-r-i-n-g-e-y moments 3) Terrible plot and letting go of all the things they tried to built without any fucking explanation 4) No decent characters and no character development at all. I could go on and on about how bad the movie really is","true":true}
