Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Toujours g\u00c3\u00a2ch\u00c3\u00a9 par des sc\u00c3\u00a8nes culculs\\, du fanservice excessif\\, ce besoin de faire du chiffre qui rend tout ciblage de public impossible et donc tout serieux dans la ligne du film irr\u00c3\u00a9alisable.\\nBref.. sympa\\, des visuels par moment superbes\\, mais \u00c3\u00a7a ne d\u00c3\u00a9colle pas.
