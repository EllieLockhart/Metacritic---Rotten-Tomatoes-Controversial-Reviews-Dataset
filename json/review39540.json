Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was a slap in the face to decades of story-telling and world building of the Star Wars universe. Not only was the entire premise of the movie awful\\, but Rey is massively overpowered\\, and can never mess up. Lightsabers seem to lack the ability to cut off limbs or truly kill people\\, rather just doing small cuts. Luke's character was truly written poorly and inarticulately\\, and we got a new side character that no one wanted. A pitiful excuse of a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
