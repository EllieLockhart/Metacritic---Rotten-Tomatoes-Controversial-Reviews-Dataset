Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't believe I'm going to say this but I am not fan of Star Wars: The Last Jedi. I mean there were a few parts I enjoyed but for the most part I'm very disappointed. I left the first movie so excited and couldn't wait for the next one. It wasn't perfect but I was happy. I left the movie theater this time not even the least bit interested in seeing the next movie. I hope I feel differently once the trailers.","true":true}
