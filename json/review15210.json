Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked the film although on the first viewing I was a little disappointed but I realised on the second and third viewing that it was my own mistake of building up expectations on theories\\, granted the film had mistakes but don't all films\\, besides all that I felt the Rey and Ben story ark was well writen and potreyed.","true":true}
