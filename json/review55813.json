Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson and Disney destroy Star Wars.   The plot and character development were very weak.  Cruisers can outrun slower ships and would not stay same speed as slower ships(epic fail).   They make Supergirl Leia which is cheesy.  They kill off Luke Skywalker (ultimate no no) \\, Admiral Ackbar\\, Vice Admiral Holdo\\, Captain Phasma\\, and Supreme Leader Snoke.   Movie tried to combine ESB and Return of the Jedi and is a big dud.   Lots of action but no foundation to hold everything together.  Also\\, the casino scene was a waste of time.  The PC crap in the movie of making the white guy look stupid while making the women and black guy look better was horrible.  Two thumbs way down.","true":true}
