Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I grew up on Star Wars and think The Last Jedi is the best movie of the series thus far.  It's funny\\, it goes to unexpected places in the overall story and ultimately it's a space fairytale for kids.  If you want to be entertained\\, this movie fits the bill.  I went into the movie with little to no expectations of where it should go and I loved it.","true":true}
