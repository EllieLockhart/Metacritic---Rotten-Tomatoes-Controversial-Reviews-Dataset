Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible film. Ruined the character of Luke\\, full of plot holes and dropped story lines from last film.  Makes it harder to like SW 7. Rey is a empty character with no arc. The plot of the movie is illogical and consquently bogs down the film with pointless subplots. Wasted characters\\, repeated scenes and dialogue from orig trig.  Tone of the film inconsistant\\, dramatic moments ruined by ham fisted low brow humor. If you follow the quick and easy path you will become an agent of evil. Don't bother to write an original story with characters that need each other and develop their skills and grow through experience (or being trained) not just gifted everything and you end up with a corporate cash grab piece of trash. Will not see the conclusion of trilogy. Will not support film by buying toys. Toys of a terrible movie don't sell\\, Disney.","true":true}
