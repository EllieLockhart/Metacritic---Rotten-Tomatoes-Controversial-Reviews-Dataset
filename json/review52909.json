Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"And here we go with the toxic fandom.  I quite enjoyed the Last Jedi\\, it really reminds me of the mirror image world they are building with this new Star Wars trilogy.  The thematic flow and mirroring of ESB makes this a stand out for me.\\n\\nWho cares what Snokes back story is?  It doesn't matter\\, he's Snoke and he made Kylo turn to the Dark Side.  Also\\, if you ever payed the PnP Star Wars RPG back in the late 80s\/early 90s\\, you'd know that Force Projection is a thing.  Oh\\, and Leia was using Force Pull on the ship and rather than pulling the ship to her\\, she pulled herself into the ship (again non-canon now\\, but part of the EU).  \\n\\nIt's clear the toxic fanboys have been busy reviewing this\\, but this is actually quite a good movie\\, if a bit long.","true":true}
