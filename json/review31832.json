Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Specifically setup an account so I could rate this awful excuse for a Star Wars movie... The Disney era has reduced an epic tale of redemption to a thinly veiled SJW rant\\, telling everyone they're sexist\/racist\/Russian if they didn't love the film. A sad fall from grace for the franchise that defined the film industry for generations. Sad doesn't even begin to cover it... The HISHE version was better!","true":true}
