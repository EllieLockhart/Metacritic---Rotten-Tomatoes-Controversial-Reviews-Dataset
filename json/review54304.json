Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had my speculations about this movie long before it was released due to the shallow narrative of TFA. When I left the theater after watching TLJ on opening night\\, I found myself in shock\\, disgust\\, and complete disbelief. The utter lack of respect for the original characters that George Lucas gave e birth to so long ago was sickening as I watched my childhood hero turn into a grumpy child-killer. On top of the horrible plot holes and lack of direction that this film housed\\, something far more insulting has taken place. The management and directors of Lucasfilm are now calling any fan that disagrees with the new films direction a racist\\, sexist\\, bigot. I cannot believe the verbal abuse that Lucasfilm and Disney are spitting at the fans that have kept this franchise alive and thriving for decades. The new direction that Star Wars has taken is about the equivalent to a dumpster fire. I will not be supporting a company that openly insults me and thousands of other people for sharing our discomfort with the new films. Until management is changed at Lucasfilm\\,\\, I'm done with \\\"Star Wars\\\". I say \\\"Star Wars\\\" because I do not associate any of this trash with the masterpiece George Lucas created.","true":true}
