Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm sorry for Ridley and Adam\\, I like them\\, but they're destined to take over a very bad sequel of Star Wars\\, instead of being in any other very nice movie. Acting is good\\, plot seems OK\\, but do not dare to call it Star Wars. That's why the audience stands over 51% as of this writing.\\n\\nLuke runs away to die\\, really? When in episode VI he wanted to challenge the Emperor and Vader unprepared? Snoke is useless. No compelling history\\, no relationship with episodes IV to VI\\, and yet after episode VI he manages to opress the would-be Republic? Nonsense. Rey is very clever\\, smarter than the Grand Master Jedi\\, why? After years and years of preparation\\, Luke seems insecure as hell and Rey all the wisdom\\, courage and strength. Can anyone tell me if Chewbacca appears? Phasma is another pointless character. DJ is predictable\\, and wasted too much time in the casino. Kylo doesn't seem with the mental strength to be the ruler of the First Order\\, with Hux trying to challenge him and noticing Kylo is very impulsive\\, he doesn't seem smart enough. In short\\, no great evil\\, and no great Jedi master.\\n\\nThis can be any other movie and it's fine. Acting. Plot. You can listen to the critics. But don't call it Star Wars. You could work with stories from Legends but Rian was too narcisist\\, and you can see the poor result\\, killing the Star Wars essence.","true":true}
