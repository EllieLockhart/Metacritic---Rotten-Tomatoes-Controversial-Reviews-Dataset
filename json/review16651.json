Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Incredibly underwhelming follow up to The Force Awakens. The Force Awakens added new life to a franchise that had been killed by the prequels. However\\, after watching this film\\, I'm inspired to think that this trilogy will face the same demise.","true":true}
