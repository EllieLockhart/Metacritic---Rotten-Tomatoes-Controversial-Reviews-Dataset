Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So hard for me to give it this rating\\, just because I am a huge Star Wars nerd. WHY WAS THE EMOTION NOT THERE?!?! That part where Luke just grabbed the light saber and threw it behind him?! Shaking my head. That should have been a much more moving scene\\, like the preview portrayed. Every scene where Luke is seen for the first time in years is just awful. It\u0092s like\\, \u0093oh hey\u0094. Almost like they weren\u0092t even surprised he was there. Where was the emotional music welling up as he was shown for the first time? Come on man. I\u0092m no director\\, but I think I could have done better. The comedy was funny\\, just not enough of the emotional scenes to balance out all the funny parts.","true":true}
