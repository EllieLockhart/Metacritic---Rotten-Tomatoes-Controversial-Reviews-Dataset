Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too much feminist crap.  Too many holes in he plot.  Simplistic death of a \\\"powerful\\\" figure.   The list goes on.  If this is the new path of the franchise\\,  The \\\"New Hope\\\" died and so should the franchise.","true":true}
