Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually this film was stunning - Mark Hamill did a wonderful job with the script that was given to him. The \\\"dark\\\" path they put his character on wasn't the issue - the issue is that you care no more about the new characters than you did at the end of TFA. This entire thing felt completely shallow\\, absorbed with being as edgy and dark as possible while forgetting that character developement and heart are required.","true":true}
