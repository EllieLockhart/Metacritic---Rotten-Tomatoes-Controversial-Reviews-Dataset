Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie was so terrible\\, I had more questions coming out of this movie.  I felt fin had no development from the first movie. it was as if his journey was in a loop. the one thing i enjoyed about the first series and even the prequels was the development between Master and student. There was none of that\\,I felt Rey could have been more believeble with more interaction and training with old Luke. I wont get into the issues i had with that\\, due to i kinda figured he turn out this way\\, and Rey would he his way back to his old self. Either way\\, there wasn't enough character building\\, each character seemed forced or rushed. I did like bb8. he got half a star!","true":true}
