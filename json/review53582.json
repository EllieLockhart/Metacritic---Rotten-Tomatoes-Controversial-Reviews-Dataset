Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic film\\, particularly the acting from Driver\\, Hamill\\, Isaac\\, Del Toro\\, and Gleeson.  The cinematography was absolutely beautiful\\, especially the shots on Crait.\\n\\nI really do not understand the hate for this film.  I am an absolute die hard Star Wars fan and am dumbfounded by some of these reviews.  I think a lot of people overlooked the foreshadowing early in the film\\, misunderstood a lot of the themes of the movie\\, and flat out didn't hear lines explaining some of the supposed \\\"plot holes\\\" people are bringing up in their reviews.","true":true}
