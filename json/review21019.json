Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wasn't totally enthralled by The Force Awakens but it was enjoyable to a degree as it felt familiar (copying the originals). So I was curious to what would happen in The Last Jedi. But Luke tossing his Lightsaber away\\, with stupid attempts at humor and a pointless 'theme park creation' using sub-plots\\, along with the baffling ability to destroy star ships by using lightspeed made it feel irrelevant. The movie was meaningless. It bore no resemblance to a Star Wars movie. Why buy this franchise only to subvert the product and brand? I don't understand it at all. It was a blockbuster space soap opera\\, not an independent 'political' art franchise. This movie is only for new fans who want politics not star wars. Don't waste your money on this trash! The few good moments and cinematography are not enough to save it..","true":true}
