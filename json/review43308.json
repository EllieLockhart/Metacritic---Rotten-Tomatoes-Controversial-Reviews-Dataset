Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a good movie\\, not gonna go on and on about why I thought so\\, just going to give it 5 stars and say the only reason the audience score is 44 is because all the fanboys are pissed none of their theories heading into the movie worked out the way they wanted it to. Get over it.","true":true}
