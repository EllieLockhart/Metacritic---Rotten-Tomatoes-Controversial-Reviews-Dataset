Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"its really all been said\\, and sjw bs and Kathleen Kennedy have no place in star wars.  Also keep one director who has all major plot points planned out for the movies ahead of time\\, at least everyone should agree lucas did that right.","true":true}
