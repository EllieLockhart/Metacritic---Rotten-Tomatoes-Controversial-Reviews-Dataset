Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is hot garbage.  They sidelined the most exciting and interesting character from force awakens in po danrek.\\n\\nLack luster resolution to fasma and fin.  Not to mention completely ruining fins hero moment for him to complete his story arc as a hero to go out in a blaze of glory\\, saving his friends.\\n\\nAbysmal waste of snoke\\, with no explanation or back story for the character or even a hint.\\n\\nCompletely rewriting the character of luke and what the originals established his character as.\\n\\nPlotholes galore!!!!\\n\\nWeak writing that could have eliminated they need for 20mins of the movie with a 5sec conversation between a admiral and her highest ranking captain to let him in on her plan.\\n\\nIgnorance of basic physics and how a vacuum works in space\\, and gravity for that matter.\\n\\n20mins of the movie being essentially fruitless after a rather tedious build up\\, referring to undercover mission.\\n\\nReys apparent mastery of the force without any substantial training.\\n\\nLackluster backstory for rey.\\n\\nAgain reference knights of ren for them to be nowhere in the movie.\\n\\nUntrained stable boy apparently proficient in the force\\, capable of casually force pulling a broom to him\\, evem though he has no knowledge or training in the force.\\n\\nLots of sjw undertones.\\n\\nThey make every male character irrational and incompetent of foresight unless its made blantantly obvious for them like rey does for luke or when po recognizes lukes obvious stall so they can escape.\\n\\nUncerimonious and disrespectful deaths for long time characters and fan favorites.\\n\\nAlso lack of common sense by characters and basic features like autopilot that where present in the originals when r2 offers to use autopilot to get to degoba bit luke keeps it on manual.....but the admirals and captains must stay back to fly their ships because they cant autopilot or leave a driod to pilot...\\n\\nJedi with raw power capable of stopping blaster fire mid air or moving dozens of large boulders have a very tough fight against no force using imperial guards.  Force push and choke\\, not employed once when both are capable.....just unnecessary and forced tension.\\n\\nAlso this movie basically made han solos death pointless.  Yes it split his soul according to snoke but he was split before that.  Anyway hes gone full on dark side so han died for literally no reason. \\n\\nThis is the worst star wars movie by a longshot from a character development\\, storytelling\\, plot progession and plothole standpoint.  The only redeaming factor is the acting performance from a few of the cast.","true":true}
