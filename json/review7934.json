Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Extremely disappointed in Rian Johnson's handling of the franchise. He completely threw out all of the intrigue from TFA and made the characters and their stories boring and dull. Unbelievable to me that Kathleen Kennedy and Disney were happy with this film.","true":true}
