Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never reviewed a movie on any platform before. I am so appalled by this movie that I actually took the time to go on here\\, set up an account\\, and review it. I think the worst part here is that professional critics think this is a good movie. Are you all that stupid?","true":true}
