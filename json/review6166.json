Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney dowe not have respect for the star wars story  fans and actors.\\nThe quality of the movie is good\\, Disney makes star wars look like pirates of the Caribbean.","true":true}
