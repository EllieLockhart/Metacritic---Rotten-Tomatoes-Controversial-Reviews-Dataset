Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly this makes The Phantom Menace look like a masterpiece. I grew up on the original trilogy and the many things George Lucas got right was the character arcs\\, the action\\, and the villains. The characters like Rey\\, Rose\\, and Finn had no change through the course of the film. The only moment that I had hope for was when Finn was sacrificing his life for the rebellion but it was ruined by the idiotic side character who died for nothing saving nobody except the person who wanted to die. The action couldn't get worse. The fight chorography in Snoke's liar was a disgrace to the stormtroopers. The villains which I can only remember two\\, were unexplored and useless. Captain Plasma the most feared stormtrooper in the Star Wars galaxy\\,  got decapitated by a rebellious\\, hot-headed stormtrooper. Kylo Ren's complete change of heart came with explanation and the greatest mystery of the  decade\\, Snoke\\, was dead abruptly with only 5 minutes of screen time.","true":true}
