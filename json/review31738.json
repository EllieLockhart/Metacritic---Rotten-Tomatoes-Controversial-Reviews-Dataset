Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So there are spoilers in this review so FYI you have been warned. \\n\\nFor me\\, this is the most intelligent Star Wars movie up to date and I like how they are transitioning from the more linear\\, predictable plots to more existential concepts. Every movie until now has been the good guys being outnumbered and throwing a haphazard plan together at the last minute that always works. For this movie\\, that is not the case. Thus\\, as a fan of the saga\\, I was initially outraged at the number of subplots simply thrown away that were built-up in \\\"The Force Awakens.\\\" For example\\,\\n              \\n              1. Snoke died after being built up to being this omniscient being.\\n              2. Rey's parents are drunken spice traders. \\n              3. Luke gives himself up to the force after one spectacle. \\n              4. Finn became a side-character. \\n\\nFor me\\, I built this movie up in my mind. I thought initially that I was robbed of possible story lines that I came up with. Such as\\, Rey being a Palpatine\\, and Snoke being someone we have seen in the past. However\\, after thinking about it\\, the main message of this movie is that even though you may be force sensitive\\, you are a mortal being. What I saw from Luke is something we have never seen before from any Jedi\\, being able to astro-project from galaxies away. This ultimately gave the ultimate sacrifice. In the end I actually like this part. I also liked how Rey comes from essentially nothing. This also proves the point mentioned prior. Furthermore\\, I really thought it was cool that Kylo killed Snoke\\, cementing his place in the Dark Side. Snoke was a weak character anyway that was a product of the flimsy\\, carbon copy plot of \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" of \\\"A New Hope\\\". \\n\\nI do think this movie suffered from the run time and scenes it opted to convey. Instead of wasting 30+ minutes at a casino they should have shown more time with Luke and Rey. Likewise\\, they never explained why the First Order fleet was stalking the rebel fleet like it was the 17th century. Yet\\, the main reason why people hate this movie is the lack of fan-service. In my mind\\, both a sense of realism and fan service were not possible without repeating themes from the main trilogy. Fans\\, in general\\, are used to sitting down and watching the saga prostitute itself in order to fulfill the needs of expectations from the extended universe. This movie changes all of that in the sense we have no idea what to expect in the next film. I think that in the end the fans didn't get what we want\\, but we got what we need. \\n\\nThis movie\\, made me do something that no other Star Wars movie got me to do\\, which was to think about the plot and what it means. They were trying to convey that anyone can be a hero essentially and we make our own destiny's. I just think people are butt-hurt because they had to think to much and we got something we never saw. Overall\\, I enjoyed the movie and it complimented the Saga. For me\\, this is on the same tier as \\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\".","true":true}
