{"101487":133029,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-05-20","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I give The Last Jedi 1 and 1\/2 stars for the aproximately 15 minutes of  good footage it contains.  I liked the mental connection between Rey\\, and Kylo Ren\\, their battle with Snoke's guards\\, Finn's bsttle with Captain Phasma\\, and his attempted self sacrifice to hold off the first order.  But the rest of the film is dull\\, and is actually insulting to both the original characters\\, as well as the current ones.  The new characters introduced are borderline annoying(Rose) and 2 dimensional cardboard cutout(Hodo).  The weak sauce plot involves a frustratingly slow space chase\\, will highly illogical ineffective ships\\, and weaponry.  There are scenes lifted verbatem from The Empire Strikes Back\\, and Return of the Jedi\\, but nothing really happens to advance the story of Star Wars. Rey finds Luke\\, but his character is completely different than he was in the original trilogy\\, and not in a good way.  He doesn't teach her anything\\, which ends up making her Seem more like a Mary Sue than ever.  Finn is stuck on a pointless side mission riding space horseys with Rose. Poe is made to look foolish\\, and is berrated\\, and emasculated by the obnoxiuos Admiral Holdo.  Leia has almost nothing to do\\, but get sucked out into space in what may be the most embarrasingly silly scene in Star Wars history.  BB-8 can now do litterally anything\\, and acts as an easy way out when our heroes get into trouble... The list goes on\\, and on\\, this is an astonishingly inept film\\, and honestly imho\\, is not worthy of the Star Wars name.  Basically\\, a pretty good fifteen minute short surrounded by a very bad two and a half hour movie. Highly UN-recommended!","true":true}
