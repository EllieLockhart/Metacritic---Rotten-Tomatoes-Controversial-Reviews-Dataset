Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"RIP Star Wars.  This movie fell short.  It's an awesome responsibility to take on and write a movie in this type of franchise.  However\\, Rian Johnson failed in every single major moment that needed answering.  It was lame\\, I watched because it's the franchise I love but it's one of the worst.  Certainly along with the prequels","true":true}
