Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really enjoyed the movie. Some of the decisions the filmmakers made shocked me\\, almost angered me at time\\, but at the end it all beautifully made sense and I was overjoyed by a Star Wars movie willing to take risk with the formula and exited for the future of the Saga!","true":true}
