{"101487":105463,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-10","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a strong fan of Star Wars\\, I was naturally excited to see Star Wars: The Last Jedi. My love for the franchise had been renewed when I saw The Force Awakens at the time of it's release. I fell in love with the new trilogy's new characters (Finn\\, Rey\\, Poe Dameron\\, etc.) and engaged to see where this new generational story would go in seeing these new characters and characters of the past unite. Unfortunately\\, this movie does not offer a compelling second chapter to its predecessor but rather creates a movie that regresses and sidelines its own heroes and denies its old characters the proper characterization and utilized time they deserve.  \\n         Star Wars: The Last Jedi has the responsibility of continuing where The Force Awakens left off\\, mere minutes in fact of Rey holding out the famous Skywalker lightsaber to Luke himself. Even though very little time has passed in the universe from the last movie\\, why does it feel like these characters are not the same people? Let us start with Poe Dameron. In The Force Awakens\\, Poe was depicted as a very kind and respectful person\\, to his dedication to the Resistance and his friendship with Finn after mere moments of meeting him\\, something that was pleasant to see after seeing so many cocky hot-shot pilots in fiction. However\\, The Last Jedi takes all that away from Poe and reduces him to another one of those archetypes. Now this movie has him apparently going toe-to-toe with this new character\\, Vice Admiral Holdo\\, because he's so reckless and glory-chasing now that he openly defies orders from General Leia Organa and risks getting his squadron killed? This is one of many insulting character changes in the movie. Finn\\, who was the most original and compelling of the new characters in the last movie\\, is sidelined into a subplot that ends having no major effect in the long run of things. Finn also gets a storyline that apparently states how he needs to learn not to just care about himself and his own interests? One may ask how Rian Johnson forgot that Finn in The Force Awakens already was selfless and risked his life for others (from breaking out Poe\\, helping Rey\\, BB-8 to fighting Kylo Ren himself to protect Rey\\, the list goes on). Finn's character arc and storyline should have focused on the next step of finding his own freedom\/identity\/purpose from The First Order\\, to choosing for himself what he really wants to do or deciding how he wants to help others or something compelling befitting of a compelling character! Not someone who was costantly made to look stupid through throwaway lines of him just being a janitor for the First Order\\, which is another sign that Rian Johnson does not really understand the new canon of Star Wars material. Finally\\, Rey\\, who wowed audiences and myself as being an authentically written female character (something rare in sci-fi\/action)\\, is regressed to just being there to coax the male characters (Luke\/Kylo) to their 'character development'. For all The Last Jedi hyping up the next step of Rey's journey through her Jedi training\\, Rey is deprived of a genuine arc and leaves The Last Jedi exactly where she was at the beginning of The Force Awakens. All the main trio heroes' agencies are robbed from them and this is not what the second part of a trilogy should do. At this rate\\, Episode IX will have to be twice as long as usual to make up for the complete absence of genuine character arc in this movie! \\n         Let's talk about the villains of this movie now. Supreme Leader Snoke pretty much was Emperor Palpatine merged with Lord Voldemort in the last one but The Last Jedi had the opportunity to flesh him out a little at least but this movie likes to waste many of the potential it has and Snoke is no exception. For someone that was hyped up by the new canon to be very important\\, to hints in novels\\, comics and more\\, nothing is revealed about him at his 'shocking' death. One does not do that with someone you promised to be important. A famous and funny line from \\nBob's Burgers comes to play here. From the Hamburger Dinner Theater episode\\, a customer complains of the play in this statement\\, \\\"A lie is not a twist.\\\" This describes one of the things The Last Jedi fails in. Promising one thing but then at the last minute\\, saying \\\"Just kidding!\\\" is not what a twist should be. Twists ought to be things audience weren't exactly expecting but makes sense withing the established context and statements of your own work. Rian Johnson clearly needs to work on his so called \\\"twists.\\\" \\n    Worse than Snoke\\, The Last Jedi tries to make the audience sympathize with Kylo Ren\\, one of the trilogy's major villains who if you remember killed off Han Solo\\, a character much beloved by all. The narrative frames Kylo Ren's turn to the Dark Side as being the fault of Luke Skywalker (we will see the damage his character received soon) and has Rey believe apparently that Kylo has inner goodness that will save them all\\, which has no merit as Kylo has continuously denied any chance of light in him and done nothing to warrant the audience and Rey's sympathy. Why is it that a film tries to give more \\\"sympathy\\\" and excuses to an unabashed villain yet flat out electrocutes Finn\\, the main male lead\\, for trying to get a homing device for Rey away from the spot of danger so that she can be safe? In what universe does this ground of logic make sense? Rian Johnson's unfortunately. \\n       Not let's get to the return of the original characters in this movie\\, another of this movie's crimes. Luke Skywalker finally gets a speaking role this time around. However\\, the movie does not offer any background that explains why Luke Skywalker\\, whose main traits in the Original Trilogy was devotion and determination in the light\\, now coldly does not care about the Resistance and his own sister Leia to come back. We are given no reason why Luke was there. It would have made better sense if Luke was actually doing something on the island like finding knowledge in the force to defeat Snoke or something helpful. Instead\\, Luke has become something he never would have become in the first place. Even the backstory with Kylo Ren is poorly executed and vilifies Luke's character in exchange for glorification of the villain. For the Force's sake\\, just let the villain BE the villain and heroes BE the heroes here! On to Leia's character\\, it's an utter crime that Carrie Fisher's last performance is wasted by putting the character away from the plot for a good while (in exchange for more Out Of Character nonsense) and subjecting Leia to utterly one of the offsetting moments in Star Wars (I'm sure you may know by the Shooting Stars Meme).  \\n         Let's continue on with the new characters this movie introduces. First \\, one of the movies tiny good spots is Kelly Marie Tran's portrayal of Rose Tico and the potential her character conveys. However\\, that is diminished with a inconsequential subplot that does little to advance any character development. DJ (that's his real name that somehow never got talked about?) portrayed by Benico Del Toro is another wasted performance as his character is utterly foreseen and could have been erased entirely. Vice Admiral Holdo portrayed by Laura Dern (the wasted potential keeps on flowing) is put in a frustrating plot that makes an utterly stupid ' twist' that not even critics should agree with. \\n        This movie's constant contribution is putting down its heroes but without the resonance of hope that past Star Wars movies did. Empire Strikes Back let its heroes in a dark place but there still was light in the character's genuine cores and trials to do good and rise above the tragedy. All the characters are where they started in the Force Awakens  but with no change at all. People and critics ought to listen to the people like me who did not like this movie to understand why we are so upset. It's not that this movie was unexpected and we didn't want to be surprised. Rather\\, we wanted to see it done WELL.","true":true}
