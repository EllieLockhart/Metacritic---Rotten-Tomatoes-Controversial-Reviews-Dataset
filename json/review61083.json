On this\\, the pluses of the game end.\rThe disadvantages of the game include the gameplay\\, which has not changed for 7 years; Non-plot NPCs (especially noticeable at the beginning of the game) arrived right from the beginning of the PS3 era; The gameplay becomes boring and burdensome after 12 hours; and a small list of technical and visual miscalculations\\, but they are so little noticeable that I will not describe them completely.\rNow about the story. The story is cliched and consists of stamps. But there is nothing wrong with that. And in general\\, as long as the story adheres to the cliche\\, it is adequate. Boring but adequate. But as soon as the story throws an unexpected twist it looks very strained. An unexpected twist for the sake of an unexpected twist\\, and spit on everything. And yes\\, excessive violence does not equal genius. The screenwriter is not Lars von Trier\\, not George R. R. Martin. There are also times when the screenwriter doesn\u2019t even reach the Uwe Boll level. Into the account of the excessive SJW agenda. I didn\u2019t see her there at all. And it seems to me that Naughty Dog specifically created a scandal around this. For me\\, if the game came out in the days of PS2\\, it would be just an unremarkable product\\, but in the era of PS4\\, it's just a waste of money.\rBut shady\\, because a society has already appeared around the game that totally praises the ingenious plot\\, it can be assumed that Naughty Dog will continue to create mediocre games with what they consider to be an ingenious plot. And professional critics will continue to bet 100\/100\\, for the sake of receiving Playstation money.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
