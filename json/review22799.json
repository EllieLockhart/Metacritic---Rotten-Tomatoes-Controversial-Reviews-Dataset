Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loads of fun\\, drama\\, sadness and Porgs. We miss Carrie Fisher. Worth seeing The Force Awakens before The Last Jedi. Definitely very different from other SW films which is why it's caused such a huge division in opinion. Definitely worth seeing yourselves to make up your mind. If you enjoyed Rogue One\\, I reckon you'll like this one. If you've been ambivalent about previous Star Wars films you may also enjoy this one\\, it really shakes up the system. Lots of loose ends but may be resolved in future films (or have ended up on the cutting room floor\\, we will never know). Perhaps worth watching the director's cut too\\, see if that answers anything. One of my favourite Star Wars films now!","true":true}
