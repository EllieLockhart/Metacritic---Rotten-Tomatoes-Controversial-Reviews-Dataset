Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bravo to taking chances (popular or not) to take the mighty franchise that is Star Wars kicking and screaming into new territory. While it is obvious some of the \\\"alterations\\\" were meant to serve the long term goals of the movie business; there is more than enough here to  intrigue new audiences and keep the long time fan going.   My favorite personal insight (suspicion or feeling!) is that Luke was not so much snuffed out as ascended- destined to play an even bigger part in the fate of the rebellion.  We will see.","true":true}
