Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The aesthetic of the movie is awesome\\, the plot is quite good\\, the characters are well written. One of the best\\, if not THE best of the franchise.","true":true}
