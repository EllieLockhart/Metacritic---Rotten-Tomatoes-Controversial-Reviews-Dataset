Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If some body asked me to describe this movie in one word...\\nPointless would be that word\\n\\nI remenber liking some of it\\, but when i think back\\, really\\, i just want to create a fanfic of it... and not in a good way like the noncanon star wars stories. But in a \\\"I gotta fix this $*#*&\\\" \\n\\nthey couldnt pull out any concept they were triying\\n(most of the movie happens in one place but a lot is happening) a lot of nonsense happened\\n(holdo is bad\\, but she is not\\, she is a hero) she is a bl**dy idi*t\\, she just needed to say \\\"we have a plan\\, i just wont tell you\\\"\\n(canto bight) you might think i will trash this one\\, but i have to say i really liked the concept of war and how powerfull people get money because of it... buuuuut... yeah its trash\\, this is bathroom breake... \\n(rey is no body but even a no body can be the greatest) mary sue in history... its a nice think to say\\, but it didnt came out motivational\\, it came out... poiinttlleesss.\\njust like snoke\\nand phasma\\nand the first order in general\\nand lukes daily rutine\\, and his way of training\\, and his mother loving dead!\\n\\ni actually liked leia using the force\\, liked rose sister\\, benicio del toro\\, luke first leason\\, the viasuals... but BOMBS FALLING IN SPACE and LIGHT SPEED IS NOW A EFFECTIVE WEAPON... sooo yeah","true":true}
