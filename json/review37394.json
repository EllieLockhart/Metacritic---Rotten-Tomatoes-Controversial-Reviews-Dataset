Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The problem with this movie is not any sort of betrayal of SW canon or beloved characters\\, or that it tries new things - it is a simple matter that whatever this movie tries to do\\, it is very bad at trying to do it. I have no problem with trying to reboot the SW universe by making bold decisions\\, as long as bold decisions have some resemblance of sense and cohesion of the narrative.\\n\\nThis is quite simply awfully bland 2.5 hours in theatre with mindlessly boring sub-plots and irritatingly shallow characterisation of Snoke\\, Finn\\, Poe\\, even Leia. Major plot engines make no sense at all and are simply put there in hope that audience won't ask the simplest of questions \\\"Wait\\, what...\\\" which is fairly insulting. You can't just peddle any mindless rubbish that fails the first logical hurdle and expect audience to buy it simply because it is Star Wars.\\n\\nThe Force Awakens\\, rehash as it was\\, felt entertaining and going in some right directions. This movie behaves as if that never happenned and goes towards 2.5 hours of almighty\\, excitings\\, never-ending do-or-die megaclimax after megaclimax.\\n\\nI've seen that incoherent and unimaginative The Phantom Menace 3 or 4 times in my life\\, I cannot see any set of circumstances that would make me see The Last Jedi ever again.","true":true}
