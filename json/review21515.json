Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would rate this movie 0 stars if I could.  As a lifelong SW fan\\, I was beyond disapppointed in this installment.  I actually left the theater wanting my money back.  I didn't like the new characters (Rose and Holdo) at all.  Several side plots were so weak and pointless.  Some of the scenes were so cheesy I almost laughed out loud at their ridiculousness.  Major characters and their backstories were wasted.  Silly humor that wasn't really funny at all.  This movie was such a major blow to my beloved franchise.  I actually hated this movie and am fearful for what will happen in episode 9...don't care really about anyone that I grew to like in episode 7 (Ren\\, Poe\\, Finn and Rey) as they were ruined by this movie.  I can only hope that Lando will return to save this sinking ship\\, but then they'll probably just kill him off too.","true":true}
