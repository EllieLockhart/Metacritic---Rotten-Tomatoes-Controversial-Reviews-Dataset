Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yeah...  Ummm..  WTF did I just watch?   I did not enjoy the estrogen wars on masculinity.  Will not return for next episode: Star wars: the Vagina Chronicles.\\n\\nI liked the interaction of Ben and Rey...  but that was just about it.   everything else pretty much whas a very large sh-- sandwich.","true":true}
