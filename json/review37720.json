Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There was a lot in this movie that was a return to the origins of the first 3 episodes (4-6) and it actually made far more sense than the broad and terrible story flaws of Force Awakens. It had some flaws I don't deny that\\, but it was a beautiful movie. The only reason force awakens did so well IMO was because everyone was so excited about a new star wars that they ignored all the flaws.\\nIf you enjoy a return to some of the core concepts of what makes star wars great\\, and you actually pay attention to the religions that the jedi\\, and the force are based upon and enjoy the connection than this movie will be a good one for you.","true":true}
