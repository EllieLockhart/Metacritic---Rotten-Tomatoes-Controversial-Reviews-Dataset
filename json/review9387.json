Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Give Rian Johnson some experimental side project set in the Starwars universe\\, sure. But please make The Last Jedi non-canon. The film is spitting in the face of all life-long Starwars fans. GIve us a director who knows what he\/she is doing. J.J. Abrams is good. Dave Filoni\\, even better. Genndy Tartakovsky is fantastic. fix this mess. please.","true":true}
