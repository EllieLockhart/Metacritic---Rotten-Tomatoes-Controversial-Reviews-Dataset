Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm really not sure what to say other than I'm so disappointed in this movie. I went with my wife and 20 y\/o son and we are all huge Star Wars fans and we left the movie all thinking the same thing...why did they ruin the everything that we loved about Star Wars! I'm not going to explain all the reasons why this movie was so bad. I will say this\\, if you are a fan of Star Wars you will not like this movie. If you are looking for answers that was set up from Force Awaken\\, you will not like this movie. If you are hoping that Luke has any real role in this movie\\, you will not like this movie! If you would like to see how a real icon of a brand like Star Wars gets destroyed...this will be the movie for you! I really wished I listened to the Audience rating and not see this movie!","true":true}
