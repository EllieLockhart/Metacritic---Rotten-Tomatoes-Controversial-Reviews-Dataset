Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot holes\\, characters introduced and exited without reason\\, over reach of fake science even for space opera\\, abandonment of entire first trilogy. Why the hell is Yoda even in this? If heroes had listened to Laura Dern everyone would have gotten away. This is forgotten. More plot hole. So when can the Force do all this new stuff? Mark Hamill is great! \\n\\nA simple question that sums up short comings: Who the hell is Snoke? Apparently\\, creators don't know either..","true":true}
