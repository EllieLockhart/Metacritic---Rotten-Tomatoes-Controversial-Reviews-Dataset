Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you hated Luke and Han in the original series and wanted to see them grow into pathetic losers\\, The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi are the films for you. If you were also eager to see a girl who\\, with almost no training and while had not believed in the force a week ago\\, beat up on someone who has had years of training in the force\\, and then get no real explanation as to why Rey is apparently God\\, this is the film for you. If you really hated Star Wars and wanted to see it jump off a cliff\\, this film is for you.","true":true}
