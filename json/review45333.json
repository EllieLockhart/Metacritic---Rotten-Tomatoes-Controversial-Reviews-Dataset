Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Utterly bad cinema experience.  That's the first thing\\, the shell.  The second thing is the complete subversion of a glorious work of fiction that is Star Wars.  This is not a \\\"reboot\\\".  It is a smudge\\, a stain\\, a wreck\\, a catastrophe.  This is a completely artless science fiction movie.  It is an a la carte DIY movie put together in a way that must have seemed just neat or cool to somebody. A series of strung-together scenarios that must have seemed really good as a storyboard at some point.  Or a bunch of clipped-together comic books.\\n\\nAnd the tone is all over the place.  There is levity\\, then there is supposed to be some gravity\\, then there is supposed to be some fancy.  The problem is that these transitions occur not just within the movie but within *individual scenes*.","true":true}
