{"101487":138677,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I preface this review by stating how appalled I am by trolls\\, bots\\, and contracted crap starters purposely getting on here to trash this amazing\\, unexpected rousing effort by a wickedly talented Rian Johnson\\, who commands performances out of a stellar cast that George Lucas could never do on his best day. \\n\\nThere are spoilers - turn away now. \\n\\nThe good:\\n\\n1) Absolutely undeniable statement about the power of leadership vs. the need to be a hero. The hollywood concept of male-ego dominate heroism is reformed and shaped into something completely different. To see Daisy Ridley's Rey\\, Carrie Fisher's Leia\\, Kelly Tran's Rose\\, and ultimately Laura Dern's flawlessly executed Vice Admiral Holdo - all have crucial contributions to the progression of this story line and in someway\\, kick every guy in the butt to get them to ultimately do the right thing.  Holdo's final act\\, I believe\\, will go down as one of the most spectacular acts of sacrifice in the entire series\\, Rogue One included.  Leia's use of the force in coming back to her injured ship from outer space was surprising\\, but in a way.... expected. She may not use a lightsaber\\, but she did save Luke's ass in Empire with the force\\, She is a daughter of Anakin\\, after all. Her role was graceful\\, tough\\, funny and so well acted. The writing of this role was worthy of Carrie Fisher's legacy and I could not think of a better last impression for her. \\n\\n2) The space battles were absolutely insane. As soon as I saw the dreadnaught show up in the opening series\\, I nearly crapped myself. I realized this was not your father's empire. The arc set up from this scenario for Poe Dameron was absolutely where his character needed to go. He needed to ascend to his rightful place as the resistance leader\\, but needed some General Leia knowledge to do so\\, and Johnson wrings out every bit of conflict and tension possible to do this.  Again\\, outside of the emotional undertones to Holdo's interactions with everybody else and how it all comes to a climax at her sacrifice is  so meaningful\\, but the sheer presentation and execution of her light speed impalement of the entire Supremacy fleet was absolutely unreal. \\n\\n3)  New characters. Rose\\, DJ and Holdo were needed additions to this story\\, and while some may argue the Canto Bight sequence was unnecessary\\, I do not. It added a new story element on the unspoken truth of War\\, Inc.\\, which may lead to more development in the last film. If you remember\\, the manufacturing of war for an ulterior motive happened in Clones and Revenge\/Sith\\, so this emphasis is nothing new. I feel that Rose stomping a major foot in the foundation of the first order's financial base was very important\\, as well as Rose planting seeds of hope in Canto Bight's children. Do not be surprised if we see these children in Rey's Jedi Academy in the next film. \\n\\n4) Humor. This is one of the funniest Star Wars movies in the series. Even the the dire and dark circumstances the resistance faces\\, Carrie Fisher's ability to take one sentence\\, one phrase and make it hilarious is unmatched. Poe Dameron's prank call in the beginning just exposes how much of a royal tool General Armitage Hux is. His stature is reduced here\\, and rightfully so\\, after being the bastard he was in Force Awakens\\, he completely deserves the \\\"Kylo's bitch\\\" status he has to own toward's the end of the movie. Yoda's appearance in the movie\\, albeit short\\, was characteristically Yoda\\, but unpredictable in what he would do. How he still treats Luke like that dumb kid on Dagobah was absolute fan service\\, and absolutely perfect. \\n\\n5) Surprises. I though the porgs were a neat little feature for Ahch-to .....it had a tribble-like presence in a subtle nod to \\\"Star Trek\\\". I thought the mirror scene with Rey was very interesting and a parallel to the cave scene in empire\\, where Luke faced...ultimately.....himself. Snoke's throne room scene was thrilling\\, exciting and also multi-dimensional. Rian Johnson simultaneously thrilled the fans and trolled them at the same time after Kylo and Rey cleared the room. I feel like Rey and Kylo's space facetime was not all Snoke's idea\\, as he claimed\\, I believe\\, and you may want to kill me for saying this\\, that we are seeing the beginning of forbidden love. Just like........Anakin and Padme....but this time...done with conflict\\, controversy\\, ambiguous morality and no real sense of protagonism and antagonism. I beg JJ Abrams......please make the Rey\/Kylo tragic love story happen. Rey showed that even though she vehemently hates his actions\\, after seeing the torture inside Ben\\, she believes she can save him. Isn't that what most strong women want to do with flawed men they can't help but to love? Episode 9 HAS to do this - period - or it will be the biggest wasted storyline opportunity in the history of the franchise. Luke's denouement after saving the day was fitting\\, appropriate\\, moving and ultimately....heroic. Let's be real\\, Rian\\, eventually had to let the male heroes have some victory\\, even at the end. \\n\\nThe bad:\\n\\n1) I feel some of the CGI during the chase scene in Canto Bight was a bit off\\, effects-wise and could have been worked on.\\n\\n2) I feel that Luke should have shown up on Crait instead of projecting himself there\\, he could have fished out his X-Wing and made it happen. And just as the force allowed Leia to survive space\\, the force would have easily allowed Luke to deflect the walker cannons. I feel he should have been harder on Kylo Ren\\, and beat his ass just a little. Plus\\, Luke has the force ability to take down every walker. I would have lost my lunch if I saw that. I then would have had him kneel before a wounded Kylo Ren and disappear after using the force that way.  There are gives and takes to this idea\\, but I think Luke could have done a little better than a glorified parlor trick as his opus. \\n\\n3) DJ's character by Benicio Del Toro was slimy\\, but not deep on character. It would have been awesome to know more about him\\, and not his swindler-ism be so telegraphed and predictable. I feel like it was acted as good as could be\\, but the character was written poorly. \\n\\n4) R2-D2 was underused in the movie - again\\, even though the bit of nostalgia he supplied was wonderful.\\n\\n5) Speaking of droids\\, where was my BB-8 vs. BB-9E battle???  Come on\\, the WALL-E fan in me wanted to see that happen!  JJ\\, that's another thing in 9 we have to see.\\n\\n\\nAnyway\\, the bad was not enough to outweigh the good\\, or even dent it. Thus my 5 stars. \\n\\nTrolls\\, go screw yourselves. Everyone else - you're welcome. May the force be with you.","true":true}
