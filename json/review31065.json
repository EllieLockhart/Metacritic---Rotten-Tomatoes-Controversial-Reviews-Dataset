Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So I'll be straight. I'm from the team that loved the movie. Not only because of the excellent special effects\\, the photographs\\, the action scenes and also in my opinion (from now on) the performances - MAs was not only that that made me put The Last Jedi\\, like one of the best films of the franchise\\, but by Rian Johssom do what no director would dare to do\\, and what JJ Abrans (Today I recognize)\\, did not want to do\\, that was to leave the comfort zone\\, to present something new to the new public\\, a range of open possibilities\\, and not just do the that ALL SEVEN MOVIES did that is bring the same journey of the hero\\, Siths X Jedis and Skywalkakers and Skywalkers.\\n\\nBecause a nobody can not be chosen and finally bring pa to the galaxy\\, besides re-establishing the Order of Jedi ?? Because Snoke was not just another Sith who succumbed to his own gain and that of his apprentice and died deceived\\, just as it was Plegueis and Palaptine ?? Why Rey MUST HAVE A FAMILY with the Jedi to be a Jedi ?? Why can not women earn their space in the movie ?? And why Luke's redemption was not a beautiful tribute ?? Why was it horrible for the first time to see Leia Organa use the Force ??\\n\\nin short\\, these attacks that the hates are doing will unfortunately undermine all that Rian Johssom wanted to bring\\, which was a range of possibilities well beyond a galaxy that was always in the same things ..\\n\\nWhat a pity...\\n\\nWhy is it so hard to accept new things ??","true":true}
