Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie took huge steps back from The Force Awakens. Where there were questions we wanted answers to\\, and scenes we were looking forward to this movie completely failed at all points. If the intention was to make a sporadic plot line to \\\"keep the audience guessing\\\" while simultaneously destroying parts of lore and history that longtime fans loved just to make new fans feel welcomed into their own version of Star Wars than this movie succeeded.","true":true}
