Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Changing the directors midway was the worst idea. Rian Johnson's movie has a lot of plot holes\\, uninspired characters and really bad pacing. He sacrificed logic and common sence for the sake of bad humor. It's objectively a bad movie.","true":true}
