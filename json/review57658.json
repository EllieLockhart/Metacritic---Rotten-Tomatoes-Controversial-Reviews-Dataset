Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Totally disappointed. The plot\\, both in terms of content and consistency was horrible. Character development was a mess at best. There was an abundance of overacting by most of the secondary characters and a fair amount by the primary characters. I attribute a lot of that to cringeworthy writing as I believe John Boyega and Daisy Ridley are good actors\\, but they were not done any favors. Finn is 100% irrelevant and given the task of conveying Modern Family-esque humor and giving a 45minute setup for Benicio del Toro's unnecessary character\/cameo. Rey is forced to be tied to the hip of Adam Drivers horrible acting or Luke's awful dialogue\/forced character \\\"development\\\". Holdo is the antithesis of Jar Jar Binks\\, but just as likely to make you throw something at the screen (and though annoying\\, the voice acting is better than her acting).\\n\\nA good fictional universe establishes its rules and laws and stays consistent with them and by doing so\\, make you able to relate to the events occuring within the universe. This movie will do anything to progress the weak plot in the direction they want it to go and it feels more like an episode of a show trying to fill its episode quota. There is no journey or development here; Rey is a jedi master\\,  just add water. Instant gratification peppered with one liners just to set up to what I'm sure will be the most over CGIed\\, overacted lightsaber sequence of all time. \\n\\nI truly did not like this as a movie fan or as a Star Wars fan\\,  no matter how I look at it. Unfortunately\\, nice looking CGI and a good marketing budget are all you really need to have a successful movie anymore. I will pass on IX and it won't make any difference in the grand scheme of things\\, but there is nowhere the plot can go in the final movie that I particularly would care for. I have no investment in the characters\\, plot or universe anymore.","true":true}
