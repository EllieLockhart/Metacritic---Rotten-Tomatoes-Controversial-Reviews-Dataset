Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A truly atrocious souffl\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 (C) \\, inconsistent\\, ill considered\\, inedible\\, drizzled in a thick creamy sauce of bitter disappointment. Clearly so bereft of energy\\, inventiveness and the giddy wonder that distinguished its predecessors\\, choosing instead to hide behind faddish partisan politics\\, baffling and inconsistent character development and excruciatingly ill judged humour. All I ask of Disney now is that continue to render this type of appalling entertainment and make it easier for me to walk away from this faux Star Wars. I'll stick with my blu rays of the originals and as before I paraphrase Genesis 9:7 Go forth and multiply Disney.","true":true}
