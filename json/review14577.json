Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a lifelong fan of the movies and read some of the extended universe.  The originals shaped my young life and are some of my fondest memories.  \\n\\nThis movie did not disappoint me at all.  I am always worried when they add another layer onto the things I love because it is hard to measure up.  Even with an extra digression or two that slowed it down\\, I found this movie to be wonderful and powerful.  I feel like the new cast members have stepped up and am enjoying watching my old heroes pass on the torch.  \\n\\nIt is almost impossible now to be really surprised by a movie\\, especially with the formulas of the modern mass media\\, but there were moments in this where I was truly and surprisingly moved and delighted.  I feel they took what I loved and made it richer.  \\n\\nI will say it gets better with repeated viewings.","true":true}
