Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just terrible. After the disappointment of TFA I hoped for more but this was not it. I've decided that the Star Wars saga ends with ROTJ. These movies are just big budget fan fiction for all I care now. Welcome to corporate Star Wars. \\nDisney and Marvel found huge success translating the Marvel characters to the big screen as faithfully as possible. They established the MCU. For some reason with Lucasfilm\\, Disney decided to alter an already established movie universe as much as possible without just creating a whole new franchise. \\nIf you accept this movie as part of Star Wars\\, you might as well just skip the other 7 movies since this one undoes almost everything about them. \\nAgain\\, for me the saga ends with ROTJ. This movie made a ton of money but I suspect half the audience won't be back for Solo or episode 9.","true":true}
