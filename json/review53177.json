Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Beautiful movie\\, but personally I rank movies on overall plot strength and character development (btw\\, this is my first post but not a spam account\\, I'm a real person).  The plot was very shaky and limited in terms of overall character development or setup for episode 9.  As a huge fan of this series\\, I wish they would have spent more time on the story\\, I'm afraid there is little left to go for Ep. 9 with how they ended it.  \\nWorst part - they focus on this item towards the end of the movie which seems to be really important\\, even though it was never mentioned or in any of the previous movies.  Like every other plot thread\\, it never gets explained\\, but I guarantee this will be incorporated in the new Han Solo movie.  Maybe it just might help him win a ship in a game of luck at our favorite new setting in TLJ?  Guess I have to see two movies now to understand one in its entirety.  \\nI left questioning whether this movie was worth my time","true":true}
