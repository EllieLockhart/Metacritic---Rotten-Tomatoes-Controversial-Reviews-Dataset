Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went in with high hopes.  I was a huge fan of Rian Johnson's Looper\\, and enjoyed The Force Awaken's\\, and The Last Jedi trailers looked amazing.  The film didn't get off to a good start\\, with a \\\"your mom\\\" joke right out the gate\\, followed by some incredibly unrealistic space combat.  (apparently you can drop bombs in space)  But really\\, Tie bombers in Empire Strikes back were more efficient.  The film continued with realism breaking stunts\\, poor dialogue and painfully poor humor.  Then  it got worse.  The plotting was horrible\\, the writing choices by Johnson hurt.  I was offended when I left the theater.  I won't spoil anything\\, but the big twist is that there is no twist.  Hopefully they retcon this entire piece of garbage.  But don't take my word for it.  Go watch it for yourself.","true":true}
