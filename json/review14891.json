Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hope Episode 9 is five minutes long and it's Chewbacca flying the rebels and all of the characters that I used to care about directly into the sun. This answered every question that I had after watching the Force Awakens and the answers are so unbelievably stupid\\, insulting\\, and uninspired that you'll think you're watching a parody. I need someone to show me exactly what ground this movie broke\\, it had some great moments that had no weight to them that were book ended by extremely dumb moments that had me thinking\\, \\\"Did that really just happen?\\\" While the said cool moment was happening. Somehow I lost all interest in the Star Wars franchise today. If someone told me I could watch episode 9 tomorrow\\, I'd say\\, \\\"I'm good.\\\" This bad taste in my mouth will not leave anytime soon.","true":true}
