Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was it just me or was this very poorly done? I still stand by my comment about Daisy Ridley's acting ability\\, it's so wooden and reminds me of the kids in the first few Harry Potter films. In fact all the acting was bad and the sorry was kind of meh! The critics must have been paid off because their reviews are too generous.","true":true}
