Except for a couple of things:\r- The stealth feels great and realistic in this game\\, it's something you'll crazily enjoy if it suits you.\r- The level design is insane this time\\, elevating the gameplay to its maximum potential.\r\rDon't trust some angsty youtube guy. This game IS a PS4 must-play.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
