Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I feel bad for the CG artists and SFX people because those were the only good aspects of the film. Rian Johnson and the writer ruined the hope and heroism of Luke Skywalker and added some terrible new characters out of a tumblr blog. The movie is Post-modern ugliness and it sickens me.","true":true}
