Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I read that Mark Hamill expressed his dislikes about the vision and direction of The Last Jedi. There is no actor or character more dedicated to the Star Wars saga than Mark Hamill. I could not agree more with him. The lack of quality story and character building and relating was atrocious. Simply put\\, The Last Jedi should be thankful for The Phantom Menace or it would be scraping the bottom of the barrel. I think I could speak for all Star Wars fans and say\\, we just wanted to see Luke Skywalker kick butt. As a kid\\, I was not a Luke Skywalker fan\\, but again\\, Mark Hamill has a great relationship with Star Wars fans. He's awesome.","true":true}
