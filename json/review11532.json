Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible part of the SW saga! COMPLETELY RUINED original cast members & disgraced the original hero's & villains! AVOID this trash with its male-hating &  white-hating agenda politics! Check out any decent review on YouTube from REAL fans.
