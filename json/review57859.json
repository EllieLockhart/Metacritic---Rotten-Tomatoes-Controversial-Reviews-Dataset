Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well... at least this is better that EP VII\\, although that's an easy task. \\n\\nOn the plus side\\, this is not a remake\\, Mark Hamill is good\\, it's very comforting to see Carrie Fisher\\, excellent special effects and the final act including the light saber battle is original and well executed.\\n\\nUnfortunately\\, it feels more like an Ep IX instead of a middle episode\\, it's a very long movie which they could sure cut 20-minute or so removing the \\\"Fynn-Rose Casino travel\/plot\\\" since it does not add anything to the story saving everyone time and money\\, the story is below average\\, it does a poor job with the flow of the characters\\, it's so obvious they want to disconnect form original trilogy (and they shouldn't) but they simply can't and they reconnect with a comment\\, character or spaceship in order to keep the story somehow interesting.\\n\\nIn the end\\, the story has a bad narrative\\, it creates more questions than answers\\, strong characters are underused and for the loyal \/ informed star wars fan you leave the theater with a bittersweet taste.","true":true}
