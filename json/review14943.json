Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just feel like they failed to understand what made \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" so great. For me\\, it was the Chemistry between Finn & Rey\\, but in \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" they're barely in the same scenes. To be honest\\, nothing really happened in the Film because all of the subplots went absolutely nowhere. None of their Plans worked. Then\\, Luke\\, whom we've been waiting to see in Action\\, did not do very much. The movie felt like it was all over the place with too much (crude>) humor. I do like the Cast\\, of course\\, but they were not used well\\, at all. And I know people love BB8\\, but the droid had some over-the-top stunts in this one. I miss J.J. Abrams as Director. The movie didn't have the same feel to me as Ep.7. The Critics seems to like it\\, which makes me wonder if I'm missing something because it was 30 minutes of Story stretched into 2 and a half hours. The ending Battle looked like it was taken directly from \\\"The Empire Strikes Back.\\\" Am I the only one who sees this?","true":true}
