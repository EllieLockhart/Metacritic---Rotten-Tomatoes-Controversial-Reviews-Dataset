Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow what a great movie!   JUST kidding! Seriously\\, it was awesome.....just kidding! No really\\, you'll love it.......just KIDDING! This film tried to fake you out every ten minutes\\,  with more filler nonsense ( crap comedy\\, pointless plots (let's rescue these camel horses\\,  even though we'll all die in the process) and agenda that no one cares about) to hide the fact that their is no direction here.  It's like the writer forget to develop a story until the day before filming.  It feels like someone is trying to project their own angst toward society into a film where there wasn't an opportunity\\, so they just wrote in nonsense to say \\\"screw you!\\\" person\/s that i feel are ruining my ideals. This\\, was a waste of time. Even on its own (if they had made this a seperate Star Wars universe) it would be crap. By trying to continue a story that many of us love\\,  they got lost in the lore abd ended up giving us a lost story.","true":true}
