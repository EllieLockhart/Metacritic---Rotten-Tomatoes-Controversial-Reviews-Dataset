Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I never write reviews but feel the need to after seeing so many negative ones. Those that say this loses the spirit of Star Wars are missing the point. There are also complaints about not knowing more about Snoke and complaining about the reveal of Rey's parents. That's the point of this movie. It's more than just about one person or group. It's about The Force. Knowing Rey's background shows how The Force can be strong with anyone. Pay attention at the very end with the little boy who is also a \\\"nobody\\\". He uses The Force to get his broom. Luke discovered a truth... The Force does not belong to any group or being whether it's The Sith or The Jedi. That's the point of the movie. So I would say that this movie\\, at its heart\\, is more Star Wars than the others. I honestly think much of this hate for the movie is misguided. This movie actually throws out much of the expectations and theories of what people thought would occur and moves Star Wars in a new and exciting direction. I can't wait for the conclusion of this trilogy. This movie made me wanting more!","true":true}
