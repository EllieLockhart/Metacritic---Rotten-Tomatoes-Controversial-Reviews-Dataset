Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not going to go the way you think..... As a long time Star Wars fan (old skool!)\\, I can understand some of the frustrations that people have. However\\, I think this film was a brave step by Rian Johnson. It is very funny in places\\, and there are some extremely moving scenes\\, not to mention several unexpected twists. It is far from perfect\\, (there aren't many perfect movies) yes it is quite long and the Canto Bight part was a bit meh but people\\, you need to accept it as it is\\, as opposed to how you imagined it in your heads :)","true":true}
