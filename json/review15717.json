Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie\\, it takes your expectations of a Star Wars film and turns them upsidedown with great performances from all actors\\, great special effects and some really interesting themes. Easily in my top 3 Star Wars movies\\, a great ride. Can't wait to see it again!","true":true}
