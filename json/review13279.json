Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't understand why this movie is getting such high reviews from critics. Technically it might look nice from shot to shot but the movie is so riddled with issues in logic\\, plot holes and wasted opportunities that i struggle to find any merit i it whatsoever. Enough people have voiced their distaste so i wont drag this on. The actors did their part\\, but the writing was dreadful.","true":true}
