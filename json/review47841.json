Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where to begin? This movie was a total train wreck. Awkward attempts at humor pulled you out of the movie without anyone in the audience actually laughing. Ruins a decades long legacy of who Luke Skywalker is and what it is to be a Jedi. Makes the Lucas prequels look like Genius filmmaking. Congrats Disney...you can have the franchise and turn it into nothing more than a base cash grab.","true":true}
