Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This ranks in the level of disappointment right up there with the last Indiana Jones movie. So disappointed\\, I cannot express how disappointed I am. This is a terrible direction they have decided. I can't believe I am actually saying this but I miss George Lucas after this movie. Yes the prequels were terrible but at least they still had the spirit of the original movies carried over. This movie tried so hard to be different and to set itself apart but yet it failed to keep in mind the things that made star wars great to begin with. They destroyed the awe that these larger than life characters once had. I wish I had never watched this movie. The wonder and power that these movies and characters once carried are now gone forever. I feel like a part of my childhood was completely thrown out like yesterdays trash in order to just make the point that the star wars universe is moving on. There were other ways this could have been accomplished and not in the way this movie did it. I am so saddened and disappointed.  It will never be the same from now on.","true":true}
