Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm stunned at how bad this was.  Plot holes galore.  Bad cheesy jokes.  Pointless storylines .  It all just makes me sad. How the hell did Disney green light Ithis?  Did the writer\/director even watch the first 7 movies?  Does he understand the core of the story at all?   I'll give it a half star for looking good but that's it.  Nothing else about this movie is good.  Seems like it was designed to sell toys and that's it.  Really really disappointed.","true":true}
