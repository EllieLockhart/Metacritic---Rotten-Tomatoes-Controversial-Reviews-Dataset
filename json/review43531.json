Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was easily the worst Star Wars movie ever made! I waited for Solo to be out before I rated because rumor had it that it would be bad. However Solo was better than The Last Jedi! All of the excitement and fun of Episode VII had me excited for number 8. Then Johnson ruined it! Just cast everything aside that I was excited about!","true":true}
