Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A complete sabotage to the original trilogy and even The Force Awakens.  This movie was written and directed by folks that do not understand Star Wars or care about criticism and it shows.  Star Wars lore\\, concepts\\, characters new and old\\, and plot potential were all shamelessly destroyed in this utter troll of a movie.  Such a shame because it had all the ingredients (great cast\\, great old characters\/potentially great new characters\\, it's freaking Star Wars!) to do something amazing.  I guess all good things come to die\\, and this movie truly ruined Star Wars for me.  Disney\\, I will honestly never never forgive you for this filth and have no desire to see any of your future Star Wars movies.","true":true}
