Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful mistreatment of the Star Wars Universe and Luke Skywalker\\, it has an entire arc of waste. I hope this trash director never gets his filthy mitts on the Star Wars franchise ever again.","true":true}
