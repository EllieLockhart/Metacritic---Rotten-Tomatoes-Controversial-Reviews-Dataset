Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was so excited and looking forward to loving this movie and seeing it multiple times in theatres. I've never been let down by a movie so much in my life. A completely pointless movie\\, nothing has changed since TFA except Luke's horrible scripted death\\, if they were gonna kill him off why not have him go fight Kylo in person instead of that BS force projection crap\\, only to have him die on the island later\\, why was that x wing in the water shown if he didn't use it. Snoke and captain phasma were the biggest character let downs of all time movie history\\, both wasted characters. The storyline was absolutely terrible and got no where slow\\, so slow. So many star wars fans are in utter distraught about how bad this film was. Disney is ruining star wars\\, but hey you can buy plush porg toys at walmart now. The franchise is in a DEEP hole after this one\\, going to take a miracle to save the star wars franchise. God damn that movie was horrible","true":true}
