Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where the hell do I even start...\\n\\nLet's go with blunt: Rian Johnson and Disney ruined Luke Skywalker\\, my favorite cinematic character and childhood hero. Come to think of it\\, I don't recall ever being this upset. \\n\\nThe movie we watched was some crude amalgamation of Harry Potter\\, The Avengers and GotG with an underwhelming pinch of classic Star Wars. The incessant joking took away from anything serious this movie might have offered. \\n\\nPS\\, Rian Johnson just took my #1 Unqualified A$$wipe spot from Donald Trump.","true":true}
