Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a pretty good film and I left the theater feeling proud.  This also had a few meh ??Moments like the storyline with Finn and rose.  I did like the plot with Luke Skywalker and Rey and Kylo Rem though.  This was shocking to say the least.","true":true}
