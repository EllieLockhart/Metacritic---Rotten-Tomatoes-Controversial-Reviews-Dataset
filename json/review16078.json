Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm an old school big Star Wars fan and I really enjoyed the film. There was lots of everything to like\\, epic visuals\\, battles\\, sound\\, twists\\, action\\, suspense\\, old and new characters\\, thought provoking themes and some great little bits of humor. I really don't understand the negativity some people have towards this film. You are never going to be able to please everyone\\, but I and I'm sure many others thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to any sci-fi fan. I will definitely be watching it again. I found it to be the best of the newer star wars films since Episode 1. I didn't know the film was going to be as long as it was but I was glad it was longer as I just wanted it to keep going. The destruction of the Mega Star Destroyer was absolutely amazing. Sure there's a lot packed in and there are a couple of cheesy moments but people somehow have forgotten that the original films had plenty of cheesy scenes and that's part of it.","true":true}
