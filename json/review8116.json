Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic film. The characters are hilarious (when appropriate) and i genuinely loved the movie. That being said\\,  there were a few moments where Mark hamil came out of Luke Skywalker. Like when he brushes off his shoulder. Things like that distracted me a bit\\, but all in all\\, fantastic film","true":true}
