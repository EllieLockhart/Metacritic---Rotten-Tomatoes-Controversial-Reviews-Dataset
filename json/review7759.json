Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Excellent film! We all had our theories going in\\, but \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" blows them all away with a unique and exciting story with great character development\\, action to rival the best of the series\\, and\\, yes\\, a bit of humor to prove that Star Wars can be human. Remember when Empire Strikes Back arrived or even Return of the Jedi and everything was new and unexpected? The Last Jedi brings back those feelings and gives us all hope for the future of Star Wars.","true":true}
