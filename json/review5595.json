Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Did not live up to the hype or its star wars name. This movie did not take advantage of star war's greatest strengths\\, including locations and characters. The movie was very very local for a star wars movie. Half the movie was in a ship!","true":true}
