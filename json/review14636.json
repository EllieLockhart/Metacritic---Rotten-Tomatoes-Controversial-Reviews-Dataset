Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have grown up loving Star Wars\\, from the movies to the games. I always thought it would be cool to see new movies with characters like Kyle Catarn and Jan. I have not gotten those movies\\,like but I did get a great new look at the Star Wars universe after the fall of the Empire.\\n This is a good movie\\, does it have some down falls? Yes\\, but I still had fun while watching it and am looking forward to buying it when it comes out on Blu-ray\/DVD. We all have ideas on how Star Wars should go and if the movie that comes out is not how you thought it should go\\, GET OVER YOURSELF. Again it is a great movie\\, it even has made just over $1 billion worldwide (Since Dec 31). Great movie and I am looking forward to the next one.","true":true}
