Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this movie was poorly written. I watched all the original trilogy and then the prequels. I didn't think the prequels were that bad\\, some of the story lines were ok. I had no major issues with The Force Awakens\\, Solo or Rogue One but this movie made no sense. It is a big budget movie with a story line that goes nowhere. The only way I would recommend someone new watching this movie is changing the settings to another language that way you wouldn't know what they were saying and the inability to follow the plot (because the visual effects are actually pretty good). I never thought one movie could ruin a whole franchise for me but this one did that. I use to re-watch all the star wars movies but that stopped after seeing TLJ. Thanks Rian for taking that away from me...","true":true}
