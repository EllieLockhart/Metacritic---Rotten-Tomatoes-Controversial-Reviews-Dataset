Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If it wasnt star wars...would be an ok movie. But from Leia turning into superman and a very whiny and stupid Luke milking an alien and never once leaving the island....it sucked. No backstory for snoke.  Whatever theyre trying to do with Rey and Kylo is retarded. The whole movie was a boring chase with a crappy poor written plot.","true":true}
