Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First time I had to see a Star Wars movie twice to come down to this review.  And so after 2 weeks\\, here's my conclusion.(Star Wars fans scroll right to the bottom please)..\\nThe Force Awakens left me excited and hungry for what happens next. \\nThe Last Jedi arrived and instead of delivering the goods\\, it tried to sway me away with lackluster unwanted excuses.\\nThe Last Jedi is basically a sequel engineered for a new generation of Star Wars fans. Its blended with subliminal messages\\, the darker and more brooding undertone and even a bit of that Marvel humor formula. It has it's shining moments in terms of music and cinematography\\, as well as the development of certain characters. \\nUnfortunately in it's attempt to deviate from the space opera charm of Star Wars\\, many of the outcomes are uneven. Most of the  mysteries and doubts established in The Force Awakens are just waived away. Standing beside the pantheon of the other movies\\, it sticks out like a (slightly) sore thumb. \\nIt is saved by the brilliant performances and presence of the legacy characters...and the devout loyalty of Star Wars fans.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nseriously thought...\\n- wth was up with snoke. just like that?\\n- force phone calls???\\n- luke ... just like that???\\n- wth stupid heck casino scenes\\n- phasma???","true":true}
