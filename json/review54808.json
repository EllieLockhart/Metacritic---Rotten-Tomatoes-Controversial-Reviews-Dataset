Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It sits comfortably in the top 3 Star Wars movies along with Episodes 4 and 5 in my opinion. I am someone who is looking to be surprised during my movie-going experience\\, and am often disappointed in that regard. This movie had genuine twists\\, turns and surprises (which may be why it has received tepid reviews from audience members). I loved this movie. It did not feel like a typical second act of a trilogy and delivers while standing on its own. I\u2019m excited that Rian has been given the reigns to a new trilogy after Episode 9!","true":true}
