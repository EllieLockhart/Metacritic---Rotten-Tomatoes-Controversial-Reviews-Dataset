Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'd an absolute blast watching this although I'm amazed... considering Luke Skywalker got a punk sendoff\\, a purple haired nobody got all of Lia Organa-Solo's lines and Rose Chicken-Tikka stealing all of Finn's story.\\n\\nDespite all this I loved it \u2665\ufe0f","true":true}
