We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Exquisite gameplay\\, ALL its technical points\\, level design\\, scenarios\\, battles\\, diversity of situations (stealth\\, melee\\, shooter\\, sniper\\, survival) and artistic aspects\\, EVERYTHING borders on perfection.\r\rAt the historical level\\, where there is controversy\\, PART II fixes part I. Last of Us closed with a message that must have tormented Neil Druckman: cold-blooded killing of unarmed doctors and nurses.\r\rThis is not Abby's or Ellie's game\\, it is the PLAYER's game\\, which leads to a greater understanding of the human race\\, the concept of the enemy\\, of the conflicts between communities to establish their myths and rules.

With me or against me.\r\r(SPOILERS)\rPart II is a player's journey to a broader understanding for the player that in real life there are no extreme villains or heroes\\, everything is degrees (linked to the superheroes cards collection in the journey) therefore Abby is not a classic villain role\\, Abby has suffered that someone KILLED HER FATHER in cold blood. She must fulfilled this evil growing inside her with revenge. Although she completed her revenge\\, this one later torments her guiding her to the redemption of Lev and her sister's rescue - a great character Lev -\\, and she ends up hanging in penance. Ellie achieves her revenge too when she is drowning Abby\\, Joel appears in her mind and looks at her as if saying \\\"stop\\\" (a traffic sign that is constantly repeated throughout the streets of Seattle). Stop this violence.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
