Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A great ride with bold subversions of expectations when it comes to battles\\, heroes\\, legends and wars. Some may be frustrated by the story not adhering close to the usual genre beats\\, but I'd implore them to give it another chance as  the best rewards are in-between the lines. Fan theories and expectations are upturned giving truly unexpected developments\\, and while some seem to be stamping their feet in a tantrum\\, now\\, a second measured look should give many an appreciation that they were not only surprised but the answers they didn't expect have real meaning. I expect to watch this many times over the years\\, and it's hard to gauge how these movies will appeal over time. There are some distractions I'm unsure about\\, now\\, but there were some in Force Awakens as well\\, and I think that movie is still a blast after multiple viewings. This movie has made the main characters are richer\\, now\\, and the stakes feel higher as a result.   And because I find the emotional\\, humorous and action filled movies the most fun to watch multiple times\\, I expect this to be one of those greats.","true":true}
