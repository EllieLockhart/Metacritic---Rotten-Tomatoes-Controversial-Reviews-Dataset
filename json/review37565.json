Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is always a lot of praise for strong female characters\\, and I will give this movie that. However\\, that does not save this film any more than the special effects do.\\nThere is a blunt message in the film about animal cruelty: eating meat and using animals for sport. So the film feels indoctrinated by PeTA.\\nBut none of these things are what ruin the movie for all the fans to the point that a 13yo was quoted by their dad as saying they never wanted to see another Star Wars movie as long as they lived.\\nWhat destroys this movie is just how badly the corporate committee wrote it. To appeal to Rogue One fans\\, characters died not long after being brought back into the franchise or in some cases\\, that was their sole point.\\nBad jokes are haphazardly inserted into the dialog\\, to the point that it disrupts the narrative and feels like something out of Spaceballs (as many have noted).\\nI have watched knockoffs of Star Wars that got the formula better\\, such as Starcrash or Battle Beyond the Stars\\, and I hear that Space Raiders is just as good.\\nRegarding strong female characters\\, they are often done in many features without coming at the cost of the male protagonists or antagonists. That is not the case here. Here\\, the male characters are either unconscious or bluntly ignorant. And I mean to say that I like the female characters and admire their strength and the decent writing\\, but somehow the male ones are made tertiary. That isn't feminism.\\nI think a big problem with that is what these characters have for motives.\\n(Spoilers ahead)\\nHowever\\, the issue that everyone has with this film is not the characters or the look or even some of the weird vegan messages. It is the story. The plot of this film is one where the writers took plotpoints from the Empire Strikes Back and wrote them on index cards. Then they shuffled the index cards\\, and laid them out\\, to write the story accordingly.\\nBenicio del Toro's character is meant to be analogous to Lando Calrissian\\, but the committee decided it would be better if instead of proving good in the end\\, he seemed good and wound up a creep. Instead of a beautiful city in the clouds with a hellish underbelly of industry\\, you have a lavish gambling city with a hippodrome staffed by street urchins. Instead of having Imperial Walkers attacking a base\\, combated by trench soldiers and pilots in speeders at the beginning of the film\\, that comes at the end; but you still get Rebels fleeing a planet at the beginning\\, with a blockade.\\nThe film actually starts with a joke about Poe pretending that he cannot hear the enemy commander on the radio\\, then making a remark about his mother (misogyny). But the major upset is when we waited two years to see what happened with Luke and Rey on the island with the lightsaber\\, only to have him chuck it over his shoulder.\\nI feel like the movie is a protest against Trump\\, made up entirely of outtakes and deleted sequences. This manages to make me long for the sobriety of the Holiday Special and the prequels. This wouldn't even appeal to children\\, because it isn't fun.\\nYou might be thinking that I came in with a closed mind\\, but au contraire mon brev. I came at this with anticipation and excitement. I wanted to be thrilled and fall in love. Instead\\, this feels like they didn't know what they were doing.","true":true}
