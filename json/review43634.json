Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was one of the three best SW movies of all time (episodes 4 and 5 the others). Absolutely brilliant writing\\, character development and entertainment. We laughed\\, cried and were on the edge of our seats. There were a few unexpected twists and turns and that is hard to do these days. Bravo! It is clear why Disney signed the writer director on to write three new ones. Going to see it again and take some family members this weeekend. ","true":true}
