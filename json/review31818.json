Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Speaking from the perspective of a die hard fan... In the almost three hour runtime\\, I went from looking forward to more Starwars to knowing that the Starwars that I love is dead and gone forever.\\n\\nEven though the prequels were campy and poorly directed\\, the stories were great! What we got here was offensively dismissive to everything the franchise built to this point. This was a great opportunity truly squandered.","true":true}
