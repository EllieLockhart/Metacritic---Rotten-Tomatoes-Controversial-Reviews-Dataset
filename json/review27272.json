Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"On its own this movie is bad. As a sequel to the seven previous Star Wars films it is not only just bad\\, it doesn't make any sense whatsoever. What a colossal disappointment. F**k you Disney.","true":true}
