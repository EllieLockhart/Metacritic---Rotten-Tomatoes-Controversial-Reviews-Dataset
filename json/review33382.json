Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Taken purely as a film on its own merits and ignoring its place in the larger Star Wars series\\, The Last Jedi is an overlong\\, boring mess. None of its plots go anywhere\\, it makes little sense\\, and its constant stream of tone-deaf jokes puncture and deflate any sense of drama\\, tension or emotional involvement. With little reason to care about what's happening or the characters it's happening to\\, even its action scenes fall embarrassingly flat.\\n\\nIn it's defence\\, it's attractive\\, some of the performances are good (props to Mark Hamill and Adam Driver here) and there are some good ideas here and there - but it isn't enough even to make it watchable\\, let alone enjoyable.\\n\\nTaken as a Star Wars film\\, things get even worse. The Last Jedi not only fails to build on either The Force Awakens or the original trilogy\\, but it actively goes out of its way to derail their narratives - warping both the characters and the Star Wars universe itself in a way that is both jarring and deeply unsatisfying. It's not simply that it provides deliberately deflating answers to the questions posed by the previous film\\, its that its own story seems to be specifically intended as a criticism of the characters and the world that it has inherited.\\n\\nCharitably\\, this could be interpreted as a desire to take Star Wars in a new direction\\, but in practice this is a deeply derivative film - lifting sections wholesale from both The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi but leaving them floating\\, disconnected\\, in a weak overall structure that seems to owe far more to Guardians of the Galaxy than to Star Wars.\\n\\nCheesy\\, riddled with plot holes\\, frequently cringe-worthy and often outright boring\\, The Last Jedi has comprehensively undone all the good work done by The Force Awakens and lands Star Wars squarely back amongst the prequels - where weak humour and over-reliance on special effects are considered acceptable substitutes for the energetic\\, characterful storytelling that it has so comprehensively abandoned.","true":true}
