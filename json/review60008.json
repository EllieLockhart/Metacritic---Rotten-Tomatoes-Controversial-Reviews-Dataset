Like I would have cared more had Joel's death not come in the first 2 hours of the game\\, then the game is spent using him in flashbacks. What's the point of killing him if he shows up every 2 chapters?\r\rWhy do I care about any of these flashbacks if he's already dead? Flashbacks are used when you think a viewer can't recall information or you're telling something **outside of the larger narrative.** When all of the flashbacks happen within the time-line of The Last of Us-The Last of Us II. It doesn't make sense to tell them as flashbacks\\, if even they are vignettes of the characters life during \\\"peace time\\\" it doesn't make sense to constantly jump to them in the middle of a war.\r\rI don't care about \\\"ye olde good days\\\" if they have no real barring on the current situation besides being a late exposition\/lore dump\\, that again could have been told within the cannon narrative timeline.\r\rWhy make me sympathetic to a character after they kill off the main cast\\, if you're gonna spend half the story on them? It makes the viewer resent the character and makes it harder to care for their plight and establish a connection.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
