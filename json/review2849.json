Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful plot\\, terrible story.. the most predictable movie I've ever seen\\, from the opening titles you can already tell the whole movie\\, and let me tell you\\, you'll be 100% right about that story all the way through..","true":true}
