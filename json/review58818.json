Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Thank you Neil Druckman for making things clear and pushing your own agenda for the higher purpose of the franchise after all this disaffected player couldn't understand the meaning of Part 1. Only a literally genius like you could save such a lame story with character changes influenced by your opionon\\, regarding the feelings of every minority in such good manners.\rLmao when i read opionions about  some gamer dumbasses complaining about part 1. Looses and how to get over it and bla bla. Do they think to own a nobel prize in literature ?!?!\rNeil\\, my man knows what it's all about.  It's simple. Play golf with the face of a old men and a good old in and out game. So glad this **** get slaughtered from a strong independet women. Because **** the patriarchy. She likes animals and helped two kids of a minority.  That's the only right thing to do\\, not like this psycho freak crawling around and seeming to be controlled by some force which let kill her innocent people. It's only Abbies right to kill because she do it for wlf. They have reasons.\rHer crew was so adorable and it makes me sad we couldn't met for some burritos and do some smalltalk\\, because that's quality time.\rIn the end the psycho kid looses it's fingers and isn't capable to roll some faties. I guess\\, you get what you ****ing deserve gollum. I wish Abbie a nice boat trip. She earns it that much after she was near death dying for the sins of degenerated gamers\\, who don't understand the concept of newtons law. Believe it ****s. Violence is bad. It's Violence=Violence. Now you can call you woken. The next time i'll see you killing some AI i'll call your parents so they take away your ps4 and you are forced to play outside in a sandbox.\rThanks Neil for the enlightnement in such so dark times. You are the chosen one\\, sent to change the world we live in to the better.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
