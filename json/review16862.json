Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Interesting themes\\, decent surprises\\, and a few fun action scenes can not save this disaster. 2 and half hours bored me terribly\\, a feeling I have never had in a Star Wars film. Even the prequels were never boring. Why did we spend probably about 40 minutes following a new character and the comic relief on a video-game quest that has no connection to the deep themes or the character development of Finn? Also\\, the CGI was so noticeable in this one that it looked cheesy. At least when I walked out of the prequels\\, I was blown away by the special effects and only after watching those films age did I see those effects degrade. This movie feels like the first draft of a film that needed more clarification\\, editing\\, and common sense.","true":true}
