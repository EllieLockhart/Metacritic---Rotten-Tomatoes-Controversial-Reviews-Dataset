Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I dislike each and every Star Wars movies\\, but I saw them all\\, and this one is the most stupid I've ever seen. Basically\\, this movie explains that everything that happened before was a nonsense. \\nFor example\\, if a small spaceship in hyperdrive can destroy the shield of a bigger spaceship\\, then here you have a solution for destroying the Death Star... So they could have stop this ugly franchise at episode V\\, so at least in 1980.","true":true}
