Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"That was my saddest experience full of disappointment I had ever made in movies... wow... I did nothing expect about Disney's Star Wars but wow... that was terrible\\, even for a movie. Calling that a Star Wars is a ridiculous joke. They completely ignore the lore like noone else before... they don't even understand how the characters or the force works in Star Wars and making films with it? The complete mythology\\, seriousness and philosophy is gone. Disney made Star Wars to a stupid Pirate of the Caribbean in space\\, full of subliminal messages.? I wish George just had Star Wars died\\, and not sell it to rich old kids in suits who play with it like toys.","true":true}
