Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*spoiler free*\\nSince Disney bought 'Star Wars' I have been excited about the prospect of a larger Star Wars universe.  After seeing The Force Awakens I left the cinema with a huge smile on my face.  Rogue One - the same.\\nAfter seeing The Last Jedi\\, I did not have a huge smile on my face.  I couldn't work out what it was.  I didn't know if I liked it.  So I went and saw it again.  This time I knew what was coming so could get beyond the surprises and into the movie\\, and now I know I do like it.\\nYes\\, it has its flaws - it's at least half an hour too long\\, there are a couple of scenes I don't want to think about at all\\, and some points that can only be called gaping plot chasms\\, but overall this is a Star Wars movie - there are some good action sequences\\, heroes\\, villains\\, mystery and fun.  It isn't what I expected\\, but it's well worth a watch and I look forward to my next viewing experience.","true":true}
