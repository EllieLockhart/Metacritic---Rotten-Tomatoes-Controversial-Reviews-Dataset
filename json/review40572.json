Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst star wars filme ever made...i risk to say this is the worst film ever made!\\na lot of plot roles\\, undeep characters\\, stupid new character (rose)\\, vague lore\\, no emotion at all.\\nthe director had no balls to risk a good movie\\, and did what films nowdays are doing: make the simplier script ever to reach the maximum of ppl they can...what turns out fucking up the godamn movie.\\nand for those who are saying that starwars is unexpected\\, and that's why it's so good\\, because it don't give what we want\\, here some headup: it's not because something is not expected that it means it's good.\\noh\\, and rey sucks\\, she is the biggest mary sue ever...and leia is the godamn mary poppins\\, flying in the space and shit.\\nfu disney\\, fu \\\"ruin\\\" johnson\\, and fuuuuuuuu katheleen kenedy and you fucking sjw that fucked up one of the best gifts ever given to the humanity. fuck you!","true":true}
