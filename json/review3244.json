Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Beautiful movie with great attempts to show you something different.  Missed opportunities with regards to Lea dying\\, an unnecessary theft story\\, and the slowest chase sequence ever are the downfalls of this film.  There are a quite a few of holy S@&$ moments that will keep you entertained.  Overall a very entertaining installment to the franchise.","true":true}
