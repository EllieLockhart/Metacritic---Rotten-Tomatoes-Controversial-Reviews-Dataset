Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While it was a very enjoyable movie to watch\\, it had such major issues; the plotholes\\, general plot choices and characterisation made me not want to see it again and be afraid of how episode 9 will handle this.","true":true}
