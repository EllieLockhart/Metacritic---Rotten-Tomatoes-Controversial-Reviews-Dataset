Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was comically bad. From betraying long standing character atributes to pointless new characters\\, this movie had no real direction and it's plot falls apart as quickly as the franchise is. Don't pay to watch this.","true":true}
