Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just a few words. The story-telling was excellent\\, to an almost perfect extent. I would say it is always good to play with audience expectations\\, but leading the audience down one path\\, and then guilt-tripping them for following\\, that is not as acceptable. Anyone who has seen the film will know what I'm talking about. I left the theater pleased with the movie\\, but in respect to Star Wars as a franchise\\, I was mostly riddled with conflicted feelings.","true":true}
