Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite what the probable 1-2 star\\, half-minded reviews above and below this one say\\, the Last Jedi is a fun and refreshing look into the Star Wars universe. It was time to shake up the SW formula a bit\\, and TLJ executed this with grace.","true":true}
