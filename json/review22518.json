Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let me start by saying that I am 41\\, a huge fan of the original trilogy\\, like Star Wars Rebels * enjoyed Rogue One. \\nSaying that\\, The Last Jedi is an horrific \\\"Star Wars\\\" film. Horrific that it seems to purposely break every rule that made this franchise what it is & seemingly it does it defiantly with a middle finger up to everybody that has invested money or interested in the franchise. \\nThe characters were poorly thought through\\, even established favourites like Luke Skywalker & Leia Organa bore very little resemblance to the characters we got to know in all of the previous films. \\nThe story is so poor\\, I have to wonder how long it actually took Mr Johnson to write it as none of the original storylines or character traits were used in this film.\\nPersonally\\, after this mess\\, I will invest no more money in DIsney's version of Star Wars as they have made it abundantly clear that they do not value me as a viewer or customer.","true":true}
