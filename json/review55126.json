Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wasn't sure what to expect when going to see 'The Last Jedi'. 'The Force Awakens' (while still good) was\\, in many respects...simply riding on the success of the previous films.  No riding the coat tails of its predecessors for 'The Last Jedi'! I still felt like I was watching a Star Wars film\\, but it was definitely establishing itself as something new and unique simultaneously. The changing of the guard if you will.  \\nLuke as a disillusioned man who gave hope to the galaxy\\, but has none left for himself is very poetic\\, and tragic. He's his own man\\, who didn't live up to the expectations he had for himself; flawed and in some ways broken. Not your cookie cutter trope of the \\\"wise teacher\\\" at all. While it's not what I was expecting\\, I adored Mark Hamill's performance. \\nKylo moved into the forefront for me as the most interesting character in the new trilogy; I like the direction that they're taking his character. Personally\\, to me...it seems as though they're essentially setting him up to be the answer to the question\\, 'Can you go to the Dark Side and come back?'.  We've seen that briefly with Anakin\\, but to be redeemed he had to die. He didn't have to face a Galaxy full of people who all knew him to be Darth Vader. I am curious to see if Kylo can come back from the Dark Side and go back to being Ben Solo; to see if he can live with the choices that he's made and make amends. \\nThe other thought-provoking dilemma that 'The Last Jedi' brought up is the question of balance. It's uniquely approached\\, in a way that Star Wars has never addressed it before. Jedi and Sith are the embodiments of the dark and the light\\, good and evil\\, and have always been very black and white. The original prophecy that Anakin was supposed to fulfill was that he would be the one to bring 'balance to the Force'. To me at least\\, this film approached the idea that maybe both Jedi and Sith have misinterpreted the idea of balance. No one is all good or all bad. People are nuanced. Can someone use both the dark and the light sides of the force? I am most intrigued to see if this question is answered in Episode IX.","true":true}
