Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One star at best. Movie kind of knocked down everything that was being built up. Two much wasted time on stories that went no where. And the constant trying to make things funny and cute just hurts the eyes & ears!!! Rogue One got it right...take notes for the next one!!!","true":true}
