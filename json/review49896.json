Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You could easily tell tgere was no cohesive plan from the last movie.  Rian Johnson proceeded to trash every bit of build up Abrams left us in TFA\\, and then proceeded to destroy the legacy of the movies prior to it.  With gaping plot holes\\, forced comedy\\, and the worst chase scene in cinematic history its a disgrace to even have it labeled as star wars.","true":true}
