Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi is beyond a bad movie. Out of all the ways they could have made  a bad star wars movie\\, they managed to make one that kills everything that was ever cool about star wars.    It is as if they intentionally made every scene to break immersion.    I look forward to see the full damage this movie has done to one of cinemas biggrst franchise when ep9 comes out.   I won't be watching the movie.   I will be looking at how it will bomb art the box office.","true":true}
