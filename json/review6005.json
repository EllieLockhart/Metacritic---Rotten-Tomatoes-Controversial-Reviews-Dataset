Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing tripe that betrays every character you'll regret having  grown to love. Needlessly long\\, this cure for insomnia has five false climaxes. For me that would be a great Saturday\\, for a movie it's tedious and awful.  It\\, like many products of its time exploits fan loyalty\\, but don't get used to it Disney!  Avoid this tragic dumpster fire.","true":true}
