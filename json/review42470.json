Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a huge disappointment to the Star Wars saga as a whole. For the Force Awakens I literally came out crying because of exciment and because of the death of han solo. I came out wanting to know what happens next\\, but this movie completely destroyed my hope for this trilogy. Rian Johnson completely destroyed all the characters. I came out of this movie angry and disappointed. Not because it didn't go the way I wanted it to\\, I just wish it went a different way. JJ Abrams would've been a way better director for this movie. I don't even think that Rian Johnson even likes or knows anything about star wars. I have no interest in these new characters like I used to. Snoke and Phasma was a complete waste. Think of it like basketball\\, JJ set up a perfect pass and Rian Johnson missed. 1\/2 out of 5 because the special effects atleast looked nice.","true":true}
