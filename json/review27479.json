Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall decent movie as a Disneyfied version of Star Wars. As a Star Wars movie in the scheme of 40 years of history didn\u2019t thrill me too much. Hated the Leia scene. Hated how they wrote Luke. Hated the whole \u201clet the past die\u201d message. Hope JJ Abrams fills in some holes left from Force Awakens. Love the Porgs. ","true":true}
