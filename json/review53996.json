Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am the biggest star wars fan you'l ever meet\\, so saying that this is one of the worst movies iv'e seen ever is a big statement for me. I never cared for The Force Awakens\\, but The Last Jed was disastrous. They ruined Luke Skywalker as a character by completly changing his entire character into a quiter and nearly a student murderer\\, taking him in the direction nobody wanted him to go\\, then they killed him off. They also killed Snoke off who was one of the most hyped character in all of Star Wars. The humor was cringey and there was way too much of it. The new characters i felt were bland And not Star Wars-y. The movie was too long and I felt confused and disgusted after the end of it\\, making me want to binge watch the Originals the second i get home from the theatres. This film ruined star wars for me\\, and as long as Disney is in charge\\, I won't be seeing anymore Star Wars movies. I'm not surprised that Critic and Audience approval ratings are dropping every day. Worse than the prequels by far.","true":true}
