Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really took a dump on the fans. Destroyed Luke's character then killed him off. Finn and rose on some random side quest that really did nothing for the main story line something out of a video game side quest for extra xp.","true":true}
