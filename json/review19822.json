Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a ton of fun. The acting was great. I love the sort of starting from scratch and the movement away from the Jedi order\\, portrayed as dated and elitist. Love tortured Luke and it was a good ending for him. Also\\, forget these whiny alt-right saboteurs. Ohmygash! Diversity?! A girl be the hero of herself?! But I'm a man's man in my mom's basement\\, whaaakekwhaaakekwhaaaa??. ??????","true":true}
