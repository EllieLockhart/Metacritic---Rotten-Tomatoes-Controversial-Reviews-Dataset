Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's the best movie since Empire and may have surpassed it\\, it's exceptional\\, beautiful\\, masterful\\, and intriguing\\, never a dull moment from the creativity of Rian Johnson. After my first showing I was highly confussed and disapointed in the film\\, but my second and third seeing the movie had highly affected my feelings toward it. For anyone that did not enjoy the first showning of The Last Jedi\\, I highly reccomedn that you give it a second or third viewing max to fully appreciate it.","true":true}
