Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I understand that every movie has plotholes\\, but this is ridiculous. The entire movie is nothing but plotholes and subplots welded together lazily like some kind of outsider-arts project.  \\n\\nThe female characters are all poorly written. While the male characters get to have flaws that they have to overcome and grow beyond or fall because of them\\, the female characters are by default the perfect\\, ultra-powerful\\, altruistic\\, can do no wrong type of characters (except for Phasma who sucks at everything). They don't feel human and they don't feel vulnerable\\, which kills all suspense when they are at the center of a conflict. \\nEven a show like My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic succeeds in creating relatable\\, interesting and likable female characters (and I'd even go so far to say that the majority of Friday the 13th movies have better written female characters than The Last Jedi because those characters have flaws they are forced to overcome to defeat the big scary killer). If a twenty-two-minute long toy commercial can have well developed female characters\\, why can't a two and a half hour toy commercial have them?\\n\\nThis movie is a toy commercial. It keeps shoving new toys in your face every two minutes. New and edgy looking designs of classic Star Wars vehicles that will surely make every little boy in the audience beg their parents for a toy. The Porgs\\, cute and wide-eyed creatures that serve no purpose to the plot\\, clearly a toy Disney is trying to push you into buying. I mean come on\\, even the Ewoks had a purpose in Return of the Jedi and so did Jar Jar in The Phantom Menace. Let that sink in for a minute.\\n\\nThe humor comes barging in at inappropriate times and ruins the tension constantly.\\n\\nThis movie rehashes so much from previous Star Wars movies\\, I might as well have watched the original trilogy.\\n\\nKylo is the least intimidating villain in Star Wars history (Hell\\, in the history of fiction). For heaven's sake\\, the villain in Baby Geniuses is more intimidating than Kylo Ren ever will be.\\n \\nI'm not even going to start talking about Snoke. Everything Snoke in this movie is a huge disappointment.\\n\\n90% fresh rating? Seriously? What a bunch of jacklegs.","true":true}
