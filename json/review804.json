Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A new Star Wars for a new generation of snowflakes and social justice warriors. \\n\\nTo sum up Star Wars: The Last Jedi:\\n\\nHave you ever been driving down the road when all of a sudden some ass hole runs a red light and cuts you off. You swerve to miss the car that decided the rules do not apply to them. You are now pumping a vast amount of adrenalin into your body. First fear then anger floods your mind. You pull back onto the road and away from the guard rail you almost ran into. You look up at the car that almost killed you to see if the person driving would show embarrassement or even a apologetic wave and all you see is a 20 something year old flipping you off.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi is kindof like that.\\n\\nAside from all that I give it 2 stars because the effects and sound were great.","true":true}
