Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely loved this movie. Plenty of nostalgic references and along with a interesting new direction for the franchise that I believe works. Great acting\\, funny moments and lots of action. Don't let the rotten audience reviews stop you from seeing this movie !!","true":true}
