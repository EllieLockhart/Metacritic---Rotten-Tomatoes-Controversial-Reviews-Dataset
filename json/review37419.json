Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are a few choices made deliberately to challenge the audience\\, and while I find that admirable\\, it seems to be a bit much for people who were hoping for another fanservice-y nostalgia-fest or to have their pet theories about who's related to who validated. I've been a Star Wars fan my whole life and as far as I'm concerned\\, \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" understands more about \\\"Star Wars\\\" than \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" and \\\"Rogue One\\\" combined. It dares to be its own thing rather than be defined solely by the expectations inherited from its predecessors. It's not a perfect film\\, but its ambition and skillful execution were captivating and often awe-inspiring.","true":true}
