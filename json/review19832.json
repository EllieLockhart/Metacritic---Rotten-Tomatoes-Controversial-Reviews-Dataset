Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a very good movie overall. I'd give the first half a B and the second half an A-.  There were some plot holes (if chasing a single ship\\, couldn't you just seems a could of your ships ahead with a quick jump through hyperspace so as to had them off) and a couple of pacing issues and weird moments (could have done without the alien milk or the flying nun scenes)\\, but there were some awesome moments as well.  I thought they handled the Rey and Kylo thing very well.  I did feel like there were moments where they were trying too hard to add twists and turns\\, not giving is what we want or expect. The humor was well written\\, but some of it didn't fit the other 7 movies. John Williams did an outstanding job on the score. Hoping to see more Luke in 9.","true":true}
