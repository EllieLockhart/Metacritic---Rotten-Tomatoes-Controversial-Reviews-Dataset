Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a great movie and I will gladly go see it a third time. It's a shame that there is any backlash. The point of the movie is that the story is not going to be the same as the past movies (nor should it be). Kylo\/Ben and Rey have flawless chemistry\\, Rose adds a fresh face to the group\\, Finn's character has a good development\\, and who doesn't love Poe Dameron?\\n\\nA hint of comedy\\, a splash of romantic tension\\, LOTS of adventure and don't get me started on the spoilers with the throne room. WORTH SEEING!","true":true}
