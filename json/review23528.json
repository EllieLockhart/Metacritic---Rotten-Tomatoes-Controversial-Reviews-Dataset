Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved this film. The development of the characters was amazing\\, the new characters are fun to watch on screen. If you like saber fights\\, this is the best since Maul\\, space fights\\, Poe is amazing in the first battle. Like Empire\/First Order tech\\, the new walkers\\, the Dreadnaught\\, Kylo's Tie\\, all great on screen. More force history\\, more Jedi development\\, more Falcon\\, it's just great.....solid message\\, wonderful conflict throughout. It's easy to find things not to like\\, if that's what you want to do......but after viewing it the third time\\, this might be my third favorite SW movie of all time.","true":true}
