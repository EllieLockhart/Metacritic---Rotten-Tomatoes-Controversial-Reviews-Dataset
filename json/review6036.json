Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disclaimer: I was not feeling well when I saw the film. That stated\\, there were many moments of disappointment. The story line\\, subsequent script\\, jokes\\, character development (lack of) were not the film's priorities\\, which left me thinking it was designed for a very different type of film fan than me. Great effects\\, some breath holding moments\\, a few plot surprises and the wonderful John Williams score were the highlights. Probably will play less successfully on your den's TV.","true":true}
