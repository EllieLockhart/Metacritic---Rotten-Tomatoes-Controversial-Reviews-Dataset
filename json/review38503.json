Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars film to date. Huge waste of such tremendous potential and opportunities to create something great. Poor choices made in terms of plot and character development. Boring\\, unimaginative \\\"twists\\\". Truly unfunny attempts at humor which only cheapen the appeal of certain key characters. Imagine every wrong decision they could have made for this film and the future of Star Wars - that's what they've managed to achieve.","true":true}
