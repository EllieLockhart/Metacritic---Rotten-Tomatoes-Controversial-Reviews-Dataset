Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall just a disappointment... \\n\\nRather than focusing on snoke phasma and other characters already created in the Starwars universe\\, they add these nobody characters that really mean nothing to the plot line.\\nFins entire Ark in this movie turns out to just be a waste of time.\\nI'm sorry was anybody else looking for a real lightsaber battle? The action scenes were kind of a joke major letdown.","true":true}
