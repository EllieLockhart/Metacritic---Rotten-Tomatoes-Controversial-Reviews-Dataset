Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was by far one of the worst things to happen to Star Wars since Jar Jar Binks\\, they couldnt possibly personify a Mary Sue in Rey's character any further\\, like Anakin was literally the embodiment of Midichlorians and he needed the guidance of experienced Jedi to harness his strengths whereas Luke didnt teach Rey jack shit and she's inexplicably powerful. The plot is paced very poorly\\, all the critics on this website are clearly paid off or dont look at this movie as a Star Wars film\\, just as a another boring bland film. The canon of so many characters are inconsistent\\, and this movie raises further questions than answer any interesting ones posed through the force awakens in a very disappointing way. SHAME ON YOU DISNEY. SHAME ON YOU RIAN JOHNSON.","true":true}
