Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not only is this the worst Star Wars movie\\, it's just a terrible movie in general. Way too many pointless scenes and plot holes...terrible idea to switch directors right in the middle of a trilogy...thanks Disney for ruining Star Wars for me and millions of other fans.","true":true}
