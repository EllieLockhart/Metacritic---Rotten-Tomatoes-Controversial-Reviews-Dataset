Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a good movie. I didn't love it but that doesn't mean it was a bad movie. The story was good\\, the acting was great and the action sequences we fantastic. My only quibbles are the jokes\\, most of them\\, especially against Hux\\, gave those moments a cheesy feel. Also in ways I cant describe this didn't feel like a Star Wars movie. From the opening scrawl to the end something felt a bit off. But again I liked this movie and will see it a second time in the theaters when my wife can go with me\\, and I will be adding it to my movie collection when it's released on Blu Ray.","true":true}
