Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film lacks the Star Wars charm we all know and love.  Disney does not know what they are doing.  Story was weak\\, easily the worst Star Wars movie.  Don't go in with high expectations.  Ruins the rest of the series.  Only good part of the movie was Snoke and Kylo Ren.  Everyone else sucked.","true":true}
