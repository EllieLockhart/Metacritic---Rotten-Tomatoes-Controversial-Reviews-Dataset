The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"If you come into this game with the right mindset\\, it might shake you to your core. This game has a perfectly told story that should make you think. The parallels that are drawn between Abby and Ellie\\, and their core group of friends have been carefully written. These girls draw from the same moral compass\\, but they've been on opposite sides of a situation that puts them in a mortal struggle against one another.Sure\\, Abby kills Joel\\, who is a fan favorite. You are forced to understand this game is not called \\\"Ellie and Joel's adventures part 2\\\"...its \\\"the last of us\\\" (the last of humanity)I agree with many on the web that there are many \\\"agenda topics that are shoved in our faces\\,\\\" again\\, this world is supposed to parallel real life\\, with the trauma of child abuse\\, lack of decent males to choose from\\, it's safe to say that it isn't a stretch of the imagination Ellie would definitely be a lesbian.This story tangles with topics of broken trust\\, forgiveness\\, revenge\\, cult-like beliefs and behavior\\, acceptance of other people's actions and their right to fight for their own beliefs\\, the realization that those in your community may not give two **** about you\\, and the need to think for yourself.I'm rambling. No ellie does not get her revenge\\, she accepts that Abby was doing what she had to do after her father was killed\\, we find out near the end that ellie wished she had been used to find a cure\\, she could have \\\"had meaning\\\" she had to forgive Joel for taking that away\\, just as she must forgive Abby for taking Joel away.This game draws parallels to modern society\\, where everyone \\\"draws lines in the sand\\\" over everything and the hate and rage that is freely shown to anyone that doesn't align with you\\, this game should hopefully make us all think about how we treat others. On the flip side of that coin\\, this game is JOYOUSLY BRUTAL. No matter which character you play as\\, you become a murderous PSYCO who's bloodlust can never be satisfied\\, I went from area to area gleefully and brutally killing every one and every thing. I found myself using leg shots and arm shots to maim my human rivals\\, rather than insta kill head shots. I smiled as they screamed in aggony and their comrades freaked out just before I cut them down in brutal animation after brutal animation. I loved the adrenaline dumps as I got the crap scared out of me by the infected time and time again\\,and the dread of knowing that they COULD BE ANYWHERE. I LAUGHED AND SMILED every time I died\\, because it was all gleefully gory. The art work here is beautiful\\, the world feels real\\, the progression of the infected areas are horrific. this game is an absolute must play. Dont listen to everything you read on the internet.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
