Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was just terrible. I can't think of a single good thing about it. All the plots were destroyed\\, and everything was made to be irrelevant. The whole canto Bight sequence was totally irrelevant\\, making about 40 minutes of the movie a pointless waste of time.","true":true}
