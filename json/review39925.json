Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This Is complete garbage\\, no script\\, no characters\\, no Star Wars just another shallow movie from scifi channel\\, Even worst\\, those movies are funny at least\\, and a movie\\, not this shit.","true":true}
