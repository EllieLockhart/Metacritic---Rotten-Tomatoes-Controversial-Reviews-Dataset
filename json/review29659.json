Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson's portfolio as a director should tell you how underwhelmed he is at handling such a big name like Star Wars. Watch AngryJoe's analysis of this garbage movie. He says everything I find abysmal about TLJ. Disney is really just milking Star Wars like a space cow. Unbelievable. \\n\\nI hope they SACK Rian Johnson and improve their team of writers. Get JJ Abrams back on board\\, if he wasn't already in for TLJ. \\n\\nWith Battlefront 1&2 disappointing fans completely\\, I think I'm just gonna remember Star Wars as Episodes 4-6 and KOTOR 1&2\\, and the Thrawn books. Those are the best Star Wars experience anyone can have.","true":true}
