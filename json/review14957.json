Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just loved it. It brought a new perspective to the story. It stepped out of the hero's journey and slapped us in the face with the truth about \\\"heroes\\\". Luke was a super interesting character and Yoda's cameo was heart warming. And they are assuming things that Lucas never dared to do (And I'm not talking about camera angles) like the diverse uses of the force be it on combat or on conecting with their surroundings. Looking forward for the third one.","true":true}
