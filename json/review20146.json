Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It wasn't terrible\\, it wasn't amazing\\, it was just fine. I'll probably have to see it again to really understand how I feel about it and even then\\, I think I'll have to revise this after Episode IX is released. Since this is the middle of this trilogy\\, I think Episode IX could make my feelings on this one improve or decline. I won't spoil anything specifically\\, but I will say that it had a lot of moments that made me say \\\"ummm...what?\\\".","true":true}
