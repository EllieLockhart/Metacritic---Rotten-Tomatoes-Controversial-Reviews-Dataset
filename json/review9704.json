Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good production value\\, terrible story with nothing really happening and lots of missed opportunities to make something great. All in all a forgettable experience that managed only to alienate audience thanks to some of the most incredibly condescending pr strategies ever concived in movie history.","true":true}
