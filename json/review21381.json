Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wish I could give 0 stars!\\n\\nThis movie is by far the worst Star Wars movie ever made\\, it is an insult to the greatest intellectual property in the world\\, it gives the characters created by George Lucas and the fans a big fat middle finger while spitting in our face.\\n\\nFirst things first\\, the character of Luke Skywalker was totally mishandled to the point that Mark Hamill voices his concerns to Ryan Johnson while being ignored. The Luke Skywalker of The Last Jedi (if we can even call him that) is totally out of character.\\n\\nAdmiral Holdo withholding information from the rest of the crew was totally unnecessary and was nothing more but lazy writing created to force drama and create a subplot that acted only as a filler in the story. \\n\\nThe Holdo maneuver creates a giant plot hole for the hole saga\\, if destroying a major target by having a small ship jumper into hyperspace and then crashing with said target is possible in Star Wars\\, the why did the rebellion bother to fly the trench run and fire the proton torpedos into a small exhaust port\\, when they could have simply have an X-Wing piloted by droid jump into hyperspace while slicing the Death Star in half?when you create a fictional story you have the liberty to create your own rules for said story\\, even your own laws of physics\\, it is important for you to obey the rules of the story with which you're working.\\n\\nCanto Bight is well... let's just say that if you need a bathroom break\\, now is the time to go (although you may enjoy your bathroom break a lot more than the whole movie). Totally irrelevant to the plot.\\n\\nThe list goes on and on. Ryan Johnson succeeded in subverting our expectations. We expected a decent Star Wars movie\\, but instead we got a plate full of hot steamy excrement. He was so obsessed in being subverting that he forgot that he was trying to make a good story. Thankfully the Rise Of Skywalker retconned so many of the insults done by The Last Jedi\\, that you don't need to watch the Last Jedi. You can go staring from episode VII to IX.","true":true}
