Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall I have to say I was left feeling disappointed by this film.  It has cheapened TFA considerably as the lore and mystery established in that film has been all but cancelled in TLJ.  There were quite a few positives but the makers have pretty much ruined the basic elements.\\nWhile I appreciate Disney wants to take the franchise in a new direction\\, I think it could have been better achieved in a more considered and subtle way.  Let's face it\\, the idea seems to be to kill off many of the original characters and much of the original lore.  This could have been achieved AS WELL AS establishing history\\, backstory and explanations for certain characters.  \\nI will watch the film again to look for more positives but honestly\\, I think the intention has been to move away from traditional Star Wars and embrace a whole new audience.  They have purposefully killed the past\\, a theme very much promoted in the film itself.  I hope that his course is corrected in Episode 9 but I am\\, at best\\, sceptical","true":true}
