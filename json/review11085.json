Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"hey remember Star Wars Episode 4 5 and 6 I'm just going to remake them and kill off the old characters and not have much of a plot and I guess we're just going to keep making Star Wars movies cuz people will pay for them and we don't care about the content ...I think I will no longer support their Star Wars franchise","true":true}
