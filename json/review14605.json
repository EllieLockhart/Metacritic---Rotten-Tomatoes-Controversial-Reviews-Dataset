Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a Star Wars fan since I can remember and The Last Jedi is one of the best\\, if not the best\\, Star Wars movie of all time. The filmmakers took some bold risks that made this the most interesting action film that's come out in years. This film and TFA have given us the most complex and brilliantly acted antagonist in the Star Wars universe. Adam Driver is one of the greatest actors of our generation.","true":true}
