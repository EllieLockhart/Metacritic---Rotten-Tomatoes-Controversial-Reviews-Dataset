Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I bought Star Wars The Last Jedi was a great movie especially the lackluster performance of the force awakens which one could argue was a rehash of A New Hope with a little bit of Empire Strikes Back thrown in. The Last Jedi while not perfect is a much better movie than people are giving it credit for. I highly suggest going and checking it out.","true":true}
