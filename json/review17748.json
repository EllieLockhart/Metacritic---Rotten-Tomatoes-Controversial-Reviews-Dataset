Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It does feel different from other Star Wars movies but that's refreshing. You may not like all the decisions that are made about the plot or characters but they all make sense in terms of the larger story. The humor was mostly well timed and was funny. Not sure where it ranks yet.","true":true}
