Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love Star Wars\\, but this movie is not good. Story is disjointed and lack of respect for characters. I knew from the first scene of Luke that this was not a good sign. Sorry\\, but prequels were actually better. Thank goodness Rian is not doing episode 9.\\nI feel bad tha hired reviewers all somehow seem to give this glowing review and movie going people I talk to feel it is ok at best.\\n\\\"Help us Obi-Abrams \\,..you're our only hope\\\".","true":true}
