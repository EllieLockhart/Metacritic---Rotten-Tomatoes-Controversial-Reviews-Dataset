Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As soon as the movie was over and the credits appeared I was extremely disappointed. Turning SW into a Marvel Comedy meanwhile this is supposed to be the 'Darkest Film' out of the Saga yet? Yeah what a joke literally\\, Revenge of the Sith still is. Besides that\\, this movie makes me appreciate and value The Prequels so much more considering all the hate they got over the years. Good job ruining what TFA established and all the hype it left for this movie to answer. Disney's version of Luke Skywalker though was depressing. Complete disrespect to George Lucas's Star Wars.","true":true}
