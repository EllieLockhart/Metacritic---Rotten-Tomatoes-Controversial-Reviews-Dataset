{"101487":101519,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Alright here's some Star Wars thoughts\\, without plot spoilers.\\n\\nIt felt like the movie was tackling too many things crammed into one film. \\n\\nThere's some great action sequences. We get some backstory answers\\, but certainly not all of them.\\n\\nMark's performance has such demanding gravitas. \\n\\nI like the addition of the porg\\, don't worry guys this is no Jar-Jar.\\n\\nMy criticism with The Force Awakens is still present\\, and continues with The Last Jedi. The Jedi powers are almost too powerful to be believable\\, and makes aspect of the script seem like God-modding. We have years of past films\\, books and more and folks without training can do so much seemingly out of nowhere? I don't think so. \\n\\nRose's character while a nice addition\\, could have had her storyline and escapades with others cut from the majority of the movie for a tighter narrative\\, and to improve pacing. \\n\\nAnd there's some moments that irked me\\, majorly. But other moments where I cheered\\, laughed\\, or cried.  :) \\n\\nIt's worth seeing as major things happen\\, but I both love and hate it\\, and therefore say make it a matinee. \\n\\nWhat happened to having movie villains that were strong\\, menacing\\, scary? So powerful as to be nigh impossible to overcome\\, so when you get the better of them you can cheer? Kylo is annoying\\, can he die already because he has a temper tantrum and inadverteningly nukes himself\\, please? To mnany of the baddies in this film are laughable at best.","true":true}
