Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a good Star Wars movie\\, but not a great one. It's hard to live up to the expectations of hard core fans\\, while trying to recruit a new generation. There were sparks of greatness\\, drug down by a needless storyline that took extraneous characters on a mission that didn't effect the final outcome of the movie. Great performance by Mark Hamill who takes the character to unexpected places that may not conform to the wishes of the congregation. It might not hit the lofty myth making heights of the originals\\, but it outpaces the prequels by a wide margin.","true":true}
