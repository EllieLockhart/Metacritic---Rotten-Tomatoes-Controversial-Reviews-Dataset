{"101487":131898,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I felt like TFA setup a lot of really cool possibilities for TLJ and then they were all tossed aside.  Who's Rey?  Is she connected somehow to previous powerful Jedi or Sith?  Will she go to the dark side and kick Ren aside to go on his own as a 3rd group with the \\\"Knights of Ren\\\"?  Where'd Snoke come from\\, why is he so powerful\\, and what's his long-term plan here?  How will Luke's story play out further?  Will Luke train Rey\\, but ultimately lose her to the dark side too?  Will Luke have some bad-ass light-saber battle with Snoke and\/or Ren?  Will Ren stop being a moody teenager and ascend to a more powerful and serious role?\\n\\nBut no...  we get ships running out of gas\\, Ren and Rey doing some weird semi-sexual telepathic Skype chat\\, Rey's big family reveal being just some random nobody parents\\, Snoke being killed off way too easily with no backstory on who or what or why he's there\\, more of the extremely annoying Hux\\, and a new even more annoying Holdo (I was so happy to see her die)\\, Po's bravery and motivation being constantly undercut like he's some child\\, Leia being a fairly ineffective leader with zero plan or charisma\\, Leia doing a weird super-woman flying trick through space (I get that she's force-sensitive\\, but come on)\\, Ackbar being killed off like he's a random nobody\\, Luke's weak fake-out holo-fight and then \\\"I'm old\\\" death on a rock just to buy a few minutes for the remaining resistance to sneak out the back\\, Yoda randomly appearing and destroying the Jedi texts for no reason (except they were boring or something?)\\, the stupid side-mission to find the keymaster\\, Luke milking a space cow\\, Luke seriously considering killing Ren in his sleep just because Ren is having some dark thoughts?  ...   and the pacing\/directing of the film was just slow\/off that it felt long and boring at times.  And at the end of the movie\\, nothing had been accomplished.  The resistance was in the same exact weak state\\, perpetually running from the First Order and suffering massive casualties.  No big reveals\\, no interesting twists\\, no interesting character arcs or development.  Just some stuff happened.  The end.\\n\\nI'm just really disappointed.  There was so much story\/writing potential handed to them on a platter after TFA and it feels like they just threw it together the night before their homework was due.  And there's nothing really setup for the next movie to wonder about or look forward to.  I guess Ren takes over Snoke's chair to do whatever Sith do in their chairs and Rey eventually fights him or something?  Who cares.  Maybe those kids at the end will be trained by Rey to fight the First Order?  Meh.  Who cares.","true":true}
