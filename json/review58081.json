Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst movie I've seen in years. Terrible writing. Too many bad\\, misplaced one-liners. Terrible costumes for some characters. Terrible casting. Amanda Lawrence (Commander D'Arcy) should have never left the Harry Potter world. Laura Dern (Admiral Holdo) was written terribly\\, acted terribly\\, and looked ridiculous. Kelly Tran (Rose Tico) was an absolutely terrible actress. Terrible plot. I expected Carrie Fisher (Leia) to die because she died in real life\\, but having her get blasted out of the carrier then magically fly through the air like Mary Poppins was one of the most ridiculous plot lines I've seen in my life. It was not a creative twist to have Kylo Ren turn to the dark side again after vanquishing the Emperor. There were a few enjoyable moments\\, but they were sparse in number. It finally got better towards the end of the movie (last 5-10 minutes).","true":true}
