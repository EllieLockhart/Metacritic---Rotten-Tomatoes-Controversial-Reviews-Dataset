Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall it's not a perfect film but it's not a bad one either. If you can let go of some of its more dumb moments\\, it's very enjoyable and it's a very fun film. Kylo is an interesting character and I like the direction of the characters and Luke's character didn't feel too far fetched from his orginal character.The main themes they focus on like failure and sacrifice were interesting. The story itself wasn't good or bad but I enjoyed all the scenes involving luke and rey. The movie left me asking a lot of questions but it didn't ruin the movie for me or ruin star wars in general.","true":true}
