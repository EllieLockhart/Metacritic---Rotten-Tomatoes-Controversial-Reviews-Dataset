Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Even Mark Hamill dislikes what rian johnson did to Luke he called it \\\"a miserable despondent hermit\\\" they messed up Luke just to make a cheap Impact on the fans. Leaving that aside the movie slap the fans in the face \\nkilling everything set in the previous movies... not looking forward to see episode 9\\, this movie killed my love for SW.","true":true}
