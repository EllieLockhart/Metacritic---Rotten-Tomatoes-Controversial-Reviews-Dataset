{"101487":180071,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2019-02-25","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars movie since The Force Awakens. Force Awakens was bad\\, but this one is a disaster. Basically it's not Star Wars anymore\\, it's just a random\\, generic sci-fi movie that visually tries to imitate Star Wars. Special Effects are good\\, movie is flashy. But plot is poor\\, characters are broken\\, there is no logic or sense in events that happen on the screen. Also there is lot of remade scenes from the Original Trilogy\\, which makes The Last Jedi looks like some kind of parody. I really felt like I was watching one of these Leslie Nielsen's remakes. But his movies were funny\\, this one is not. Also it's filled with political agenda. People pay for tickets to have fun not to watch political propaganda and leave cinema angry and sad.","true":true}
