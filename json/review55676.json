Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok First and foremost I am a Star Wars Fan. I saw this film TWICE in 24 hours. Reason for this because the first viewing I was taken back by all the \\\"NEW\\\" things characters did and I wasn't sure if I liked it. BUT after the second viewing I was in LOVE with this film. Acting was GREAT and it just added to the Star Wars universe. Last Jedi is in my TOP 2 Star Wars films of all time. This film also had a beautiful send off Too Carrie Fisher.","true":true}
