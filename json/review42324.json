{"101487":185871,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie takes Star Wars in a new direction. It has themes of overturning the Pre-establish black and white right and wrong mindset. Presenting a more complex story where things art always as they seem and audience expectation will be subverted at every turn. Our heroes are wrong. They are wrong a lot. Charters are deeply flawed\\, and the world of Star Wars feels like a much more real and complex place than ever before. This movie shows a yin and yang like balance to things the other films only scratched the surface of. I truly feel that this movie is a work of art that rivals and possibly exceeds The Empire Strikes Back. This movie was more than I had hoped it could be.\\n\\nVery light spoilers:\\nWhen Luke teaches ray about the force It gives us a more in-depth look at dark and light. That seems to serve as a thesis for this movie. Posing the issue not as good and evil but life\\, death\\, and Life's struggles against chaos and entropy. When the bones of fish are shown and the prog being killed by waves it isn't an act of evil\\, near as much an act of nature. It shows how the force connects all living things in this struggle. This is a much more in-depth and mature outlook that is far more in touch with reality. \\nWe see this further as the conflict between Luke and Kilo where both have different perspectives of the events that lead to kilo's fall. \\nWe See it again with Fin at the casino planet. At first\\, enamored with the place's beauty\\, He is pried to look deeper\\, he sees the darkness within this place. Or Chewbacca eating the Porgs (a scene most seemed to have dismissed as just bad comedy). \\n\\nThis idea of bringing more deep and real outlook on life saturates every bit of this move. In a way that almost gives a \\\"nothing is as it seems\\\" feel.  It's different for Star Wars be in many ways plays with what was already established.  \\n\\nWhether people enjoy this movie depends highly on whether they are okay with this or even understood it. From looks at the online hate\\, many did not\\, and I find this very tragic. |\\n\\nPersonally\\, I love this new level of depth\\, and It has cleared up the number one issue I had with star wars since I was a child. \\n\\nI truly believe this film is a work of art to rival if not exceed Return of The Jedi. \\n\\nAlong with thematic changes\\, this movie is constantly subverting expectations In a good way\\, and I reveled in it. The move goes a path that both makes sense and is not what you expect.  \\n\\nSubstantial spoilers:\\n\\n-Luke doesn't give a crap about his old lightsaber. \\n-The big bad is scary as hell a look like a long-term problem so they kill him early\\n-Kilo looks like he will come back to the light\\, but he can't give up power. \\n-The typical incompetent commander turns out to not be so incompetent. \\n-Fins self-sacrifice is stopped and regarded as foolish.\\n-Leia doesn't die.\\n-Luke never leaves the island but still goes out like a bad ass.\\n-Yoda appears and encourages Luke in burning down the temple.\\nIt's hard to show how great these all are in writing but they all served wonderfully to the overall theme of presenting life as more complex and grey that appears on the surface. And keep me on my feet with twists that are both sensible and not expected. There are so many other things that are brought in to question or subverted. This movie asks us to question traditional heroism and rationale of heroic suicide. I find this interesting. But I love that this move asks people to think. The unexpectedness of many events in the film's plot kept me on the edge of my seat.\\n\\nAs for comedy\\, it seems like there are many complaints about jokes not landing\\, but I hardly noticed. be It seems like many of the jokes that the people take issue with (Such as Poe haling the first older ships) severed the plot or themes in some way. A lot of people seem offended by how Luke treats the lightsaber\\, but in one second we are given a deep insight into the state of Luke's attitude. It's funny because it's a subversion\\, and sort of poking fun at\\, all the hype built up in the end of the last movie\\, and it also makes perfect sense\\, for a man who (as he will later point out himself) when to an island in the middle of nowhere to get away from everyone. It's a good example of the subversion of expectations that makes total sense. It just feels so good to watch unfold on screen.\\n\\nWhen I saw promotional material for the movie I thought that the Porgs where going to be these really out of place inserts added for toy sales that we have seen in other Disney movies. Once again\\, this movie surprised me. The Porgs felt like a very natural part of the setting\\, and as I've already touched on\\, where used to buff out some of the movie's themes. All of the animals felt like a very natural fun\\, even endearing\\, part of the world and actually served the plot in some way. The new locations were felt very rich and new but still very star wars. The red slat just under the sunbaked white surface of the ending rebel base planet was climatically spectacular and just so fun.\\n\\nThis Movie kept up the force awakens tradition of homage to the original trilogy. The movie starts off with the rebels fleeing from the first order in a way that is both similar and different from empires strikes back\\, and ends with a scene that resembles the battle of Hoth\\, but once again has different emotional weight. In the beginning\\, the rebels go on the offense while evacuating. In the end\\, they are just trying to hold out for reinforcements\\, and the hope of the return of our heroes sits with the audience. \\n\\nThe Force Awakes played it very safe with a return to form of the original Star Wars Trilogy and a very familiar plot structure. It was an alright movie and the safe move was a good choice for Disney after all the skepticism in the wake of the prequels\\, but it wouldn't work twice. They need something bold and new for this movie and boy did they deliver.","true":true}
