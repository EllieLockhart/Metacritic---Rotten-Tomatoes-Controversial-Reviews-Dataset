Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Excellent movie. Very pleased with the way it panned out and was very pleased to discover it wasn't a retread of Empire Strikes Back. I really can't understand the negativity it's receiving from certain people. I'm guessing its because its the society we live in now where everybody has to hate everything. We were a family of 4 of varied ages of young and old and we all loved it.","true":true}
