Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Rian Johnson The Foolish? I thought not. It's not a story Disney would tell you. \\n\\nCons: \\n\\n- Luke's character arc & personality massacre \\n- Leia Superman scene\\n- Entire casino planet scene\\n- Early Snoke death \\n- Too many plot holes\\n- Bad humour \\n- Didn't answer any questions posed in TFA (reys parents\\, Snoke origin\\, Knights of Ren etc etc)\\n- SJW\/PC themes: All the males (Poe\\, Luke\\, Finn\\, Snoke\\, Kylo etc)  were either impulsive\\, failures\\, buffoonish while all the females did not make 1 wrong decision and were heroes (Rey\\, Leia\\, Holdo\\, Rose\\, Roses sister). The rebels were 'diverse' Latin\\, black\\, Asian\\, female\\, different species\\, whereas the First Order were all white males. Also white males are portrayed as either rich\\, money grabbing or militaristic based on their portrayal in the casino city or the First Order in general. \\n\\nThere are way more things I could list.. that are already listed... \\n\\nThere was also nothing original in this film. Making bold\\, risky (shit) decisions doesn't make it original. \\n\\nMore than anything.. I can't beleive they messed up Luke so badly... \\n\\nWeak writing and directing.","true":true}
