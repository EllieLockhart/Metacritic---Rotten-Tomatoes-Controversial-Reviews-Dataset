Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not only the worst of all the SW movies\\, but a complete insult to the fans.  This movie was shockingly bad.  I tried to watch it a second time to see if my expectations were too high\\, but no\\, it was worse than i originally thought.  This is the movie thst did the impossible - i no longer care about the past movies\\, or the future ones.  \\n\\nWell done Ruin Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy.","true":true}
