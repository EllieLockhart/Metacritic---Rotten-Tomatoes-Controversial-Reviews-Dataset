Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was very frustrated. The most disappointing part is the way Luke is in the movie. This is quite incoherent with the whole story of the character. Trying to kill the nephew while he slept was too much for me. Not to mention that he told Rey that he had not been so afraid of Kylo's power.","true":true}
