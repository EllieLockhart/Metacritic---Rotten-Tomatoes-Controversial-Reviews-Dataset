Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":" I saw Empire and Jedi in the theater. This is the best Episode since Jedi. Way better than episode 7. Don't listen to these Star Wars dorks. Go see it and have fun.","true":true}
