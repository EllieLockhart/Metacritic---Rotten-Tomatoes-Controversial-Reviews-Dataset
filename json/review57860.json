Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well filmed and had a few good moments but the use of one-liners was a bit too much but far worse was the total flop of a storyline\\, failure to address various questions and some gigantic plot holes you could hide a star destroyer inside. The more I think about it\\, the more disappointed I am in this wasted opportunity and the irreparable damage done to what has come before. A beautifully shot\\, well acted abomination.","true":true}
