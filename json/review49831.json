Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yes\\, there\u2019s plenty of action and CGI happening in this movie\\, however the plot smells a little bit of Empire Strikes Back\/Return of the Jedi mulligan stew. Ridley certainly goes through the training \u201ccave\u201d that Luke once experienced after meeting Yoda and she soon races off to save her friends. The Rebel fleet is once again fleeing a base and General Leia\\, well her performance is better than the plastic surgery she\u2019s received although the years of booze and drugs took a toll on her voice. Chewbacca and the droids put in the best performance and Adam Driver still isn\u2019t a convincing Emperor\\, but he tries and fails miserably. I do not like what Disney is doing with this franchise\\, but let\u2019s face it\\, it\u2019s Disney and it only cares about the dollars rather than a plausible story line.","true":true}
