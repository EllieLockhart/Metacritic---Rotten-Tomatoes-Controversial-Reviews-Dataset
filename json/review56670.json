Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was a strong mix of disappointment\\, confusion\\, and total imbalance of visual and emotional stimuli. Johnson opens multiple storylines throughout the film without developing a single one to a point where I care what happens next. I thought the movie was about to end 3 times before it actually did because of the multiple  Coup De Graces they unload on you. There are certain parts of the film (use of the force and character motivation) that make little to no sense at all and really make the latest installment of the Star Wars saga just that- another movie in a long line of Hollywood blockbusters. I've never found Mark Hamil's acting to be particularly impressive but his story line\\, along with Rey and Kylo\\, is one of the few parts of the movie that actually made me feel like I both took something away afterwards\\, and felt like sitting in the theatre for 2 1\/2 hours. There were certain scenes and subplots that could have been totally cut from the film and possibly made is a bit more coherent. By the end of the film\\, I didn't feel like anything had progressed very far and the big final scene left me totally emotionless.\\nOn the other hand\\, the visuals were completely outstanding; with a fair balance of space and planetary warfare\\, vibrant colors that created a masterful mix of magical surrealism and visceral imagery that made me feel like I was truly there. Although the movie has outstanding colors and sounds\\, there is a particular scene where Johnson uses both a stark lack of color and sound to totally silence the audience in awe. The lightsaber fights\\, although limited\\, were all very welcomed and masterfully executed to express the mortality and imperfections of force wielders\\, while also reminding the viewers of their superiority over the common fighter. \\nAlthough Kylo Ren was a particularly irritating character in the Force Awakens\\, he steps up as a conflicted character and one of the few I actually enjoyed following through the movie and seeing as much of as possible.","true":true}
