Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So poorly written and acted that I started rooting for the empire.  just wanted it to end already.  this is the last star wars movie i will ever sit though.  Almost nothing in the this movie makes sense.  A US Navy Nimitz-class aircraft carrier can go nearly a quarter century without needing fuel\\, but the main plot point of this movie is that the rebel ships are running out of fuel?  What\\, they need a petrol station?  Do they run on diesel?  Everything about this script is lazy.  It's like the plot of a B rated video game.","true":true}
