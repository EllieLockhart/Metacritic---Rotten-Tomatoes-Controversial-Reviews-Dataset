Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible.  Made zero sense. Bombs \\\"dropping\\\" in space like there was gravity\\, Leia flying\\, 3 hour slow motion chase scene\\, weaponizing light speed\\, hologram\\, Luke not wanting to be found even though he left a complicated map that would need the force to find him...I could keep going\\, but I won't. Rian and Disney made a piece of crap\\, with no thought or relevance.  Mindless idiots that burned a franchise.","true":true}
