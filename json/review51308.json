Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely terrible.\\n\\nSpoliers:  Flying Super Leia Organa\\, Snoke now a pointless throw away character\\, Cute space penguins and when everyone can have the force reminds me of the line when everyone is super no one is.\\n\\nWhy did Johnson feel the need to ram his or Kennedy's politics down our throats in a space fantasy film aimed mainly at kids. It felt so blatant at times it verges on propaganda.\\n\\nThe forced Disney humour editing dept has been busy in this movie as well. There are some truly cringing gags in this film it is painful.\\n\\nThe final insult is what they have done to Luke. I am sure at times you can see real pain in Mark hammils eyes\\, when he delivers his lines.\\n\\nI pity for the future of Star Wars under Disney's rule.","true":true}
