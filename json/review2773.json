Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awfully disappointing. Like Mark Hamil said\\, Luke was the new hope and when Luke became hopeless then it all ended. They might as well ended the whole star wars on this one. When Snoke got assassinated\\, it was odd that there was no power struggle within the First Order since Snoke didn't name anyone to be his successors. We knew the storm troopers could communicate via their helmets\\, why Snoke guards didn't call for help via their helmets. The plot simply wasn't believable.","true":true}
