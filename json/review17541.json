Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i signed up\\, just to rate this movie. it was terrible. Story was not complex or interesting as many \\\"professional critics\\\" claim. it was boring\\, does not follow any of the interesting themes or plots of the last film making it seem like they give up on the idea of a trilogy. the twists are predictable and soooooooo many plot holes. I do not want to spoil anything but all i am going to say is that a species who can invent light speed must have auto pilot!!!! many\\, many other totally hard to understand plot holes\\, that even the actors find hard to deliver. First time i have actually wanted my money back.","true":true}
