Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is a lot of insta-hate from longtime fans who really don't like that their 'God' Luke Skywalker might actually be a human being after all\\, and does have flaws and weaknesses like everyone else. Oh\\, and god forbid a woman can be a powerful force wielder! Seriously? Get a hold of yourselves.\\n\\nI watched this with a star wars fan who is not burdened with years of re-watching the same 7 films time and time again (an 11 year old child). He loved it\\, although some of the subtleties of the storytelling did pass him by.\\n\\nIt is not a perfect film as several plot holes make their presence felt. Villians act stupid\\, common sense is ignored for a good film moment and shots are held a few seconds too long to ensure we get the point.\\n\\nAt one point\\, too many things are happening at once in three separate storylines and the director\/editing just can't get it onto the screen in a satisfactory manner.\\n\\nFlaws aside\\, I did enjoy it on the second showing and will get the BluRay and the t-shirt and watch the next film. Yes it is Star Wars.","true":true}
