Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i thought the last jedi was awesome. i can see how some of the fans of the original series have a problem with the direction rian johnson took the narrative\\, but i think that his portrayal of ben solo's character is some essential social commentary\\, and also feel that the series is so much better for its inclusive themes.","true":true}
