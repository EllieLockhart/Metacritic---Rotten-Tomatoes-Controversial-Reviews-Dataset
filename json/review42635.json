Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was certainly not what I thought it would be at first\\, but after taking some time to reflect I feel it has a very strong and important message. Admittedly I was angry at first\\, I left the theater feeling empty\\, but after really analyzing I've decided I  like it more and more as I think. Over all this is a great StarWars film and is a very intelligent addition to the franchise. Just don't go on with any expectations what so ever. That will be your downfall as it was mine.","true":true}
