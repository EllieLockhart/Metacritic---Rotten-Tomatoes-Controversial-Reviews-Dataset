Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Johnston wrote this as if he never saw \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" or he just hated it and wanted to give a big F$&\\\" you to JJ Abrams. Completely ruined the series and the rest of the Star Wars saga. Not sure how JJ Abrams will fix it for episode 9.","true":true}
