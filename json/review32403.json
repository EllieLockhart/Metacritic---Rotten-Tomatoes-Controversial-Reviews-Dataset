Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars is Dead!!! That's it. I don't know how the saga can come back from this. Yes it is that bad. I still can't believe what I saw on screen. How can they treat beloved characters like that while replacing them with shallow\\, uninteresting hacks. Mary Sue is the worst but they are all poorly written in this mess of a movie.","true":true}
