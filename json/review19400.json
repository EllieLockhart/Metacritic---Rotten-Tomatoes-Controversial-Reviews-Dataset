Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's shiny\\, but that's about it. Muddled mess of a story with too many poorly developed characters and plot lines. Best to miss this one and wait until someone tries to reboot the franchise in another 10 years or so.\\n\\nTo the critics who gave this film such glowing reviews.... shame.","true":true}
