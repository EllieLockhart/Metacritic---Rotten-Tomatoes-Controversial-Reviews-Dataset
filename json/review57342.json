Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is tearing me apart.\\nIt has wonderful and epic moments but also scenes I wasn't far away from a facepalm.\\nThe midpart was way too long and in my opinion the whole Finn arc could've been cut and I like him very much. The Casino planet didn't feel like a Star Wars Planet. It didn't fit.\\nAnother problem were the gags. I laughed at every single one\\, but there were way too many and some of them made serious moments into funny ones. \\nMy last complaint is the number of Plottwist. Too many that single twist lost its value. \\n\\nI don't hate it but I can't love it either. It has too many problems but\\, in my opinion the last third has so many magic moments\\, that it is still a movie you should watch\\, but don't expect too much.\\nAfter the holidays I'll watch it a second time without false hope and expectations.","true":true}
