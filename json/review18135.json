Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was aweful. The self-parody and humor was completely off pace (and insults the subtle and beautiful spiritual basis of the film). I think critic reviews are \\\"corporate fan boy\\\" cheerleaders. They have the audacity to claim the user reviews are rigged. Pure nonsense. I would rate it negative stars if I could. Its pure junk. Even destroying the beautiful mythology George Lucas created\\, the film itself doesn't hold. The visual effects are wonderful\\, but that's about it.","true":true}
