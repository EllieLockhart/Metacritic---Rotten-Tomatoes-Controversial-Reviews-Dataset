Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What an outstanding adventure! Johnson delivers on a thrilling return to the main Star Wars saga. His focus on expanding the universe and breaking down past barriers allows for a much richer story than if he only delivered on fan service of what people thought they wanted. A spark of hope has returned for the Star Wars expanded universe\\, in the way of a newer\\, deeper form of story telling.","true":true}
