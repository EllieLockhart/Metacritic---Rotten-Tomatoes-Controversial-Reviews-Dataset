{"101487":153390,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*** MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ***\\n\\n\\nOverall a great movie that felt turn to the Star Wars franchise.  This is a review\/my thoughts on my 1st and only viewing so far.\\n\\nPros:\\nThe acting of Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver was spot on. \\n\\nSeeing Mark Hamil back in action.\\n\\nTouching moments with Carrie Fisher.\\n\\nWhoever played Captain Kennedy on the Dreadnaught.  Brief but great.\\n\\nAwesome break out role for Roses character.\\n\\nThe story arc and struggles between Rey and Kylo Ren.\\n\\nThe use of the Force from Rey\\, Kylo Ren\\, Luke\\, and Snoke.\\n\\nThe comedic moments may have been a bit too frequent but still played nicely throughout the film.\\n\\nMajor plot twists and turns\\n\\nVisual effects\/CGI.  You could tell a green screen was used pretty heavily\\, but it did not take away from the feel or flow of the film.\\n\\nDestruction of Snokes command ship.\\n\\nOut with the old\\, in with the new.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\nSnokes demise.  It felt far too easy and sudden.  We had just witnessed him Force levitating Rey with a flick of his finger and a seemless thought.  His ability to thrown down General Hux via hologram\\, or shoot lighting at Kylo Ren so casually.  Snoke was in the middle of stating how he was the one that bridged Rey and Kylo Ren through the Force and was able to see every thought and possible outcone.. yet he couldn't see or sense Kylo Ren moving the lighsaber through the force right next to him..  as a being of immense Force power\\, this was a bit of a let down.\\n\\nLeia sucked out into space.  We all know that Leia is Force sensitive\\, but it has been clear that she does practice or train with it at all during any of the film's.  She is able to sense people and events\\, but no actual implantation of it on herself or others.  This scene would have been a great sending off of her character given recent events.  The moment left me speechless and almost brought me to tears.  Seeing her hand twitch gave us that \\\"Hope\\\" but seeing her fly through space back to the ship was a bit ridiculous..\\n\\nLuke just becoming one with the Force.  The only way other characters have been able to achieve this is by being killed directly (Obi-wan and Vader) or dying of old age (Yoda 800 years old).  Neither of these applied to Luke.. sure he had just pushed his Force abilities to an extreme.. but that shouldn't have just outright killed him..\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nEven with the above Cons\\, they did not take away enough from the Pros and overall experience of the film to leave a sour taste in my mouth.  Rian Johnson took risks\\, which we did not see in the previous installment of The Force Awakens.  I applaud him for taking the risks\\, even if I did not fully like the way some of them panned out.\\n\\nI am excited to see where this will lead too next\\, as Supreme Leader Ren attempts to exterminate the past from the galaxy once and for all!","true":true}
