Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a good movie and an even worse Star Wars movie. Weak plot and ruined Luke Skywalker. My family of five thought it was bad. I would love to know what movie the critics watched because it wasn't the same one I saw at my local cinema. Easily the worst Star Wars movie to date.","true":true}
