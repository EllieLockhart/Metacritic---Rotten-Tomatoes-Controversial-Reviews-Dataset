Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This episode wasted opportunities to use iconic characters to develop new characters\\, instead these new characters have skills and powers without explaining how they got them. Poor writing leaves multiple plot holes and awkward comedy scenes. This film was unusually long yet felt rushed as if the writers threw the story together in a hurry. Over all so disappointing.","true":true}
