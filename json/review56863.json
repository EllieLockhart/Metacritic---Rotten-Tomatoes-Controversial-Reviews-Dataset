Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is so many things wrong in this movie. After The Force Awakens and Roque One my apetite was so big\\, but this movie is on 1-3 parts level. SPOILERS!!! Ren kills Snoke without any problems\\, Luke dying in the stupiest way\\, Rose rescue Finn\\, letting New Order to use their weapon and potentially killing all remaining rebels\\, and many\\, many more. Visualy movie is great\\, but the story is just incredibly stupid.","true":true}
