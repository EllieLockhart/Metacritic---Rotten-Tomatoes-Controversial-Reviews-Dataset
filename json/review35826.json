Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"The Last Jedi\\\" is one of the best Star Wars films yet. I loved the twists and turns and how it frequently worked against expectations\\, which is a great thing. It was 2 1\/2 hours of pure entertainment. I've been a Star Wars fan since watching the original in a theater when I was turning 12 in 1977\\, and \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" thrilled me. I can't wait until the third part of this trilogy.","true":true}
