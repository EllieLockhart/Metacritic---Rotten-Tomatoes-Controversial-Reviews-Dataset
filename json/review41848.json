Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is terrible. As a huge Star Wars fan this movie has destroyed everything I've come to enjoy about the saga. Disney has forever ruined this franchise. Don't believe the critics score...that is grossly inflated as Disney pays for good reviews. The true fan score (56% lowest for any Star Wars movie) speaks volumes. If you love Star Wars\\, stay away and don't watch.","true":true}
