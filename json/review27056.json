Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the finest episodes in the Star Wars franchise: a surprising and unpredictable turn full of delightful twists. Rian Johnson definitely puts his own spin on the saga and subverts the usual archetypes and well-trodden tropes of the genre with great inventivity and playfulness. A perfect send-off for the old generation (especially Carrie Fisher) and a great step forward for the new one!","true":true}
