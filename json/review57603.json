Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To all those who say:\\n\\n\\\"Don't fear change\\, embrace it\\\" - Change isn't always good\\, in fact\\, most times its bad. We should never accept negative change and certainly not embrace negative change just because it is \\\"change\\\". Its ridiculous that these days change is referred to as positive since most times that's simply not true. Never embrace change unless its good change\\, otherwise\\, fight it and fight to overturn it.\\n\\n\\\"Let the past die\\\" - You are nothing without your past. Your past\\, your experiences\\, what you've been through shapes who you are today. NEVER let that die\\, never let the good times die\\, let those bad moments die\\, yes\\, now\\, let good times die just because its the past\\, never.\\n\\nIn general\\, this movie had many flaws: disregard\/disrespect for the original trilogy\\, destruction of Luke's character\\, introduction of new\\, pointless\\, underdeveloped characters\\, and to top it all up its full of liberal bias and there are many scenes that intend to be \\\"progressive\\\" with a disregard to the fans\\, who are certainly not liberal. Well\\, this is what Disney does to films\\, it ruins them with progressivism.\\n\\nNow\\, there were good things in this movie: Oscar Isaac did an amazing job as Poe\\, who's character I deeply enjoyed\\, and John Boyega also does a fantastic job in his acting as Finn (unfortunately the movie wasted it in using Finn for ridiculous social critique and a secondary plot that was completely out of place). Although Rey is one of the characters with the most flaws in the entire star wars universe\\, and this film just expands those flaws\\, Daisy Ridley does a good job with the acting. \\n\\nCarrey Fisher was OK with Leia\\, and Adam Driver was OK with Kylo\\, who is\\, I think\\, a interesting character because he doesn't know if he's in the good or bad side\\, and I think there is much to be explored with his character. In this movie\\, however\\, he just doesn't reach a point of being a fantastic character like his father Han Solo yet.\\n\\nI wish I could say Mark Hamill did a good job with Luke too\\, but that would be a big fat lie. I simply hate the way he portrayed Luke\\, and his storyline and the script he has to follow with the character only makes things worse. Luke's character was ruined\\, no doubt about it.\\n\\nOther characters were plain irritating: Toro was a completely useless character that was part of a secondary plot line that doesn't fit the film. Rose was a OK character that ruined herself in the end by preventing Finn to sacrifice to save the rebels. Her line in the end \\\"Thats how we're gonna win\\, not fighting what he hate\\, but saving what he love\\\" is just ridiculous\\, and doesn't fit Star Wars at all. If you're not gonna fight what you hate you aren't gonna fight at all\\, which is just pathetic since this is Star Wars! This is out of place in the series and is just plain irritating.","true":true}
