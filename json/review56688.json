Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The leads were great\\, but were barely allowed to act. Lots of fillers\\, pointless characters (or rather caricatures)\\, and sit-com jokes while serious themes could be explored. Whole scenes that were pointless\\, blatant adoption of the style of the animated series \\\"Avatar the Last Airbener\\\" (which is a great series). Pointless\\, blatant\\, biased political speeches forgetting the very core of the starwars idea of balance. In short\\, let the actors do their job and tell a good story - this is a movie\\, not a collection of random fan fiction ideas. Cut the meat. I really liked the interaction of the light and dark side leads - give them room.\\n\\nThe effects were great\\, but too much self-indulging and removed from the established world. The inclusion of marketing material and cute and cuddly animals made my skin crawl with embarrassment.\\n\\nSPOILER\\n\\nIf a fleet of Stardestroyers could be easily destroyed by ramming\\, such fleets would never be built. The result looked cool though\\, although more fitting in an anime. It was sad to see Finn\\, a very interesting character that opened many opportunities for interesting insights and stories\\, relegated to just one more side show among many.","true":true}
