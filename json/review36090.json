Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"#thelastjedi was a boring messy circus disaster. #disney took a huge opportunity and thru it in the garbage. Men and boys all over the planet will be crushed by this forced wandering toneless episode of \u201cDays of Our Lives.\u201d For a picture that is all about hope\\, it has vandalized my spirit and crushed any hope I have in future #starwars films.","true":true}
