We can\u2019t have it because Druckmann employed Anita Sarkeesian\\, so you can only imagine where that\u2019s gonna lead. I don\u2019t mind shocking U turns when logical. But to me it seems Druckmann did it only to clear up the path for Anita\u2019s version of The Last of Us which is why it feels so nonsensical and forced. Such a waste of potential\u2026\r\rAnother reason you\u2019ll get angry is because you\u2019ll feel cheated. You paid for 25+ hours of gameplay\\, yet the game you knew ends after 30 minutes of play straight up. I\u2019d advise everyone to watch the walkthrough on youtube up until the U turn scene and then if you think that\u2019s something you\u2019ll enjoy for another 24+ hours\\, then go ahead and buy it\\, more power to you.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
