Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yup All the negative reviews are spot on. I'm a die hard fan and am normally very forgiving of Star Wars Movies but this was hot garbage. Terrible way to send Luke off into the sunset. R.Johnson should be ashamed........Disney just F****d my magical day. ","true":true}
