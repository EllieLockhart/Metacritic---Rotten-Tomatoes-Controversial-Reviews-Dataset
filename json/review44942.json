Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ughh... the force awakens was fantastic and now we have this total garbage. It suffered from the exact same issues as rogue one. Plot a hot mess\\, pacing all over the place and effectively forcing the viewer to be bored stiff for an hour and a half for maybe 45 mins of good stuff.\\n\\nHave no interest in watching this total mess ever again.","true":true}
