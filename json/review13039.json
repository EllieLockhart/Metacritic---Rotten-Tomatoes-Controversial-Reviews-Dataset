{"101487":130886,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't HATE this episode...but I didn't particularly like it\\, either. I've chalked it up to middle-movie malaise. Middle movies in trilogies are never typically any good. They set up storylines\\, flesh out old characters\\, introduce some new ones\\, and drive the story alone\\, but they're not meant to be stand-alone movies in their own right. Especially not the middle movie in a Star Wars trilogy. TLJ was no TFA\\, but it wasn't a particularly *bad* movie...just not as good as it could have been\\, for the following reasons\\, from beginning to end as best as I can remember from my one viewing....\\n\\n(spoilers now)\\n\\n1) Domnhall Gleeson CHEWING the set at the beginning. The man was reciting his lines as if it were Shakespeare. Lighten up\\, guy. I get that you're the big\\, bad\\, facist\\, pseudo-Nazy leader guy but chill out on those \\\"r\\\" and \\\"s\\\" pronunciations. Almost ruined the whole scene for me. \\n\\n2) Speaking of\\, I feel like they could have added a little more conflict between Hux and Kylo\\, vieing for the praise of Snoke. It would have made what happened near the end a little more effective. \\n\\n3) The movie skipped between events and locations WAY too much\\, and too quickly. I get that there was a lot going on and a lot of ground to cover in a couple of hours\\, but jumping from place to place evey 2-3 minutes was a little annoying. There wasn't enough time spent in some spots. Rey and Luke should have gotten the same treatment as Luke and Yoda...there should have been at least 15-20 minutes of just them\\, focusing on her powers and her training\\, not cuts to Luke reciting his cynical little list. \\n\\n4) Speaking of scenes jumping around. the casino thing was WAY ridiculous. I don't need political lessons in the middle of a f-ing Star Wars movie. Thanks\\, Disney\\, but no thanks. That's NOT why we come to see these things. Oh\\, such a moral lesson. Who's bad and who's good? They sell arms to both sides\\, it's a grey area\\, blah blah. The fathiers being whipped. The kids in the stables being forced to live with and take care of the animals. The whole liberation thing. It was SO unnecessary to the story. Give me the Mos Eisley cantina or Jabba's hideout or his yacht\\, not this silly animal and child abuse\/liberation\\, 1% vs. the rest of us b.s.\\n\\n5) Speaking of the animals\\, again - wtf Disney? Was this a Pokemon movie? The giant thing Luke was milking on Ahch-To? The \\\"caretakers\\\"? The fathiers? The crystal foxes...what were they called? Straight out of Pokemon - vulptex. REALLY? Don't even get me started on the porgs. I was rolling my eyes every time some new random animal appeared on the screen. \\n\\n6) Po Dameron was ridiculously underutlilized in the movie. His story arc was reduced to him being the hot-shotof the movie\\, and then at the end he kind of just shrugged - eh\\, ok you're right.. It seems like they're setting him up to be the Resistance leader but after seeing his progression in TLJ it just doesn't make sense except for the fact that he's the only higher up that didn't die. Another REALLY moment- did they seriously have Laura Dern keep calling him hot-head and fly-boy? Who wrote this? \\n\\n7) Super Leia? REALLY? That was the cheesiest part of the whole movie\\, and absolutely ridiculous on top of that. Plus\\, again\\, wtf Disney? We saw people freeze in space in Guardians TWICE already - why did you do it in a Star Wars movie? Is that your new thing? It's dumb. Stop it. \\n\\n8) The whole subplot between Finn and Rose could have been cut and the movie wouldn't have suffered at all. I'm still straining to even like Finn as a character. He's a coward and an opportunist. He is helpful to the Resistance because he knows everything about the First Order\\, but his usefulness ends there and I just don't feel like he should be a major character. Maybe a sidekick to Poe\\, but nothing more. \\n\\nI think I'm done with the complaints. There were some things I liked and that I'm looking forward to them fleshing out and finishing up in the next episode. I enjoyed Rey's training and I think the tension between her and Kylo should be taken a step further. It's clear that he wants her\\, even if she doesn't necessarily want him\\, and one scene in particular was\\, I think\\, his naive attempt at seduction\/manipulation. I have my own theory about who Rey is\\, and I don't believe Kylo's insistence that she is nobody. I'm hoping she's not a Skywalker\\, but I am hoping they tell us who she is really in the next one. I enjoyed jaded\\, cynical Luke and I think his story was perfect for who he was. He was never an Obi Wan or Anakin - Luke was always reluctant and over-emotional about his place in everything. His attitude later in life makes sense to me. I also really enjoyed his standoff with Kylo. For all Kylo's whining about Rey not wanting to let the past go\\, he doesn't want to either\\, and Luke left him wanting. He will never get the closure and the validation he has been so desperately seeking and now that Snoke is out of the way\\, Kylo is going to go full blown emo megalomaniac on the galaxy. Rey is his complete foil and will be his downfall. She has no parents\\, he killed his. He was trained in the Force\\, while Rey posesses control naturally and fully. Rey has gone to the Dark and came back - she was unafraid and in control\\, while Kylo lets it consume him. \\n\\nI do wish\\, all things considered\\, that they had let Leia die and re-shot the ending. I'm not sure where they're going to go from here unless they have already shot scenes for IX with her in them. A simple\\, \\\"Destroyed by the death of her brother\\, LUKE SKYWALKER\\, and devastated by the casulaties suffered by the RESISTANCE in their last battle\\, GENERAL LEIA ORGANA has died\\, and the RESISTANCE turns to it's new leader..\\\" scrolling at the beginning of the next episode is going to be a cheap send-off.\\n\\nAll in all it was a decent movie\\, and again\\, middle-movie drudgery\\, it was never going to be as good as TFA. Episode V was nowhere near as good as IV or VI\\, either. We'll see where the next one takes us\\, and hopefully with Abrams back at the helm\\, all will go to plan and we'll be satisfied leaving the theater.","true":true}
