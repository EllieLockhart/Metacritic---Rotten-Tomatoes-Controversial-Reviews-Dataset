Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Underwhelming.\\nToo much forced comedy. \\nUncohesive and splintered story line. \\nToo long. \\nSome truly gorgeous fight sequences. \\nLost the audience with some less than credible character development and set ups. \\nReally really really underwhelming dark side cave moment. \\nDid not find its tone.  \\nNot great.","true":true}
