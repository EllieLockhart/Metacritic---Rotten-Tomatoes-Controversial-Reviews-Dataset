Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To preface this review I purposely blocked out all information about the Last Jedi before seeing the movie. Star Wars the last Jedi was the perfect sequal to the original star wars series. Not only paralleling events in the original series but creating it's own image. Star wars the last Jedi is a great movie that I would recommend anyone see.","true":true}
