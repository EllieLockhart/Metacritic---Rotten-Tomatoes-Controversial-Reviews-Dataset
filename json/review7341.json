Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Episode VII had its flaws\\, but it laid the ground work for something bigger for episode 8. Unfortunately The last Jedi did nothing with it and instead made everything that happened on VII and earlier Star Wars as a big nothing.\\n\\nThis is by far the worst Star Wars movie I've ever see. a movie about nothing.","true":true}
