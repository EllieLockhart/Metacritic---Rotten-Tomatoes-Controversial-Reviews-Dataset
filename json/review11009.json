Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"heartbreaking to say but... pretty poor really. uninteresting story\\, bad acting from most main actors\\, some cringeworthy scenes. I am not a fan of the prequels at all but at least they had a coherent structured story. Rian Johnson should not allowed anywhere near star wars again!","true":true}
