Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow\\, what a fantastic movie this is\\, I really do not understand the criticism this has got from some fans\\, yes it took risks\\, but who wants to see the same star wars done before format\\, I wanted something different and I was not disappointed\\, I only wish Rian Johnson was directing episode 9.\\nLeave your brain at the door and prepare to be entertained.","true":true}
