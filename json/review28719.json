Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Putting the Star Wars aspect apart\\, this film is objectively a poor movie from A to Z.\\nThe first order has a bigger ship so it goes slower than the resistance ship \\, where are we? On a highway? They can't catch the resistance ship but can stay at the same distance all the time\\, so\\, they are going at the same speed in fact!? Does this script have been read at least a second time? \\nThe hundreds of flaws might have been spotted that way falks\\, that's the key!\\nNothing is coherent nothing works nothing is believable.\\nIt sure is beautiful\\, but in substance it's like an emergency dish made with plenty of leftovers in the fridge when nothing goes together.\\nI am personnaly outraged by the treatment of the historical characters but the problem of the movie is not even that. \\nI'm sure we would have accepted anything if it was wraped up in a cohesive\\, strong and deep storyline.\\nInstead we have been mind raped and for nothing more than \\\"subversion\\\".\\nI do suspect that we are seriously taken for mentally deficient by those guys.","true":true}
