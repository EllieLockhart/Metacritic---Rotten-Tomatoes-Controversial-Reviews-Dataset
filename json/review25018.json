Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My Review: (Spoiler Alert ??)\\n\\nStar Wars: The Last Jedi was a masterpiece in and of its own right. It took the franchise in new directions and shocked audiences all over\\, completely splitting the fandom. The movie showed that sometimes you fail and nothing changes (the Finn and Rose storyline for example)\\, it shows that sacrifice is sometimes necessary to save your friends\/loved ones (Admiral Holdo's light speed suicide slice through Snoke's starship)\\, it shows that the heros won't win all the time (the retreat from Crait)\\, it shows that even Legends will die (Luke Skywalker's death). It brought to new light that the new hero may come from parents who were literally no one (Rey's Parents). Based on past events\\, the manner and personality of an old hero may change (how Luke became after the destruction after the Jedi temple). Lastly\\, it shows that things are not going to go the way you want sometimes. \\n\\nStar Wars: The Last Jedi was different than previous films and was better for it. After this movie\\, my favorite SW movies in order are 5\\, 8\\, 4\\, 7\\, 6\\, 3\\, 1\\, 2.","true":true}
