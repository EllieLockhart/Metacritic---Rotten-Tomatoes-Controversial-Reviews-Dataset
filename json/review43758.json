Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the worst of the Star Wars Franchise since The Phantom Menace (and I didn't mind that when it first came out\\, only started to dislike it after the other prequels were released). \\n\\nBut after Force Awakens came out it restored my faith in the moviemakers\\, it was a movie that was a nod to the Original (and Holy) Trinity before it.\\n\\nSo I had high hopes for The Last Jedi\\, but from the outset...corny one liner jokes\\, disappointing plotlines and what was up with the porgs?!? \\n\\nAnd unfortunately\\, Star Wars has succumbed to the pressure and been Disney-ised...\\n\\nI have only one thing left to say...\\n\\nHelp Us J.J.
