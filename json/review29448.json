Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson had the guts to write a good piece of work that would entertain peope by showing them something new and heartfelt instead of letting himself get owned by old school fans and failing as a creative director.","true":true}
