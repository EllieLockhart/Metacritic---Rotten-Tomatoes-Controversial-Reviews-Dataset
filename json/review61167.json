The game looks beautiful at times but out side of visuals the game is lacking. The story makes little to no sense with characters not acting like themselves and being unlikeable. The story also relies too much on coincidence and is no where near the first. Gameplay is relatively the same but does feel a lot smoother.

The story makes little to no sense with characters not acting like themselves and being unlikeable. The story also relies too much on coincidence and is no where near the first. Gameplay is relatively the same but does feel a lot smoother. I love how gritty and violent it is but unfortunately gun play is stiff and feels out dated. In a game that is lead by its story I felt lost and at time wanted to drop it because I felt that there was nothing to do due to the repetition of the gameplay. Compared to other 3ps there are better ones with a better story and gameplay that is fun. The story left me confused and angry and would only recommend to those who fans of lou but even then you might be more fulfilled with just the first game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
