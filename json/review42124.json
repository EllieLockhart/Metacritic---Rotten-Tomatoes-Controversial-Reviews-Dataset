Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie rocks on so many levels. It took me about 12 hours to process after viewing it the first time\\, given how it blossoms and develops the story line into something I never imagined; but in general\\, every moment of the movie is satisfying and entertaining.  I honestly can't wait to see it again. Have an open mind and understand that trolls will be trolls\\, no matter what.","true":true}
