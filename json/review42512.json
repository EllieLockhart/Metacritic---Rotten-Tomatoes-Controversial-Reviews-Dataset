Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was amazing! Top notch acting\\, great deep story\\, intense\\, exciting fights\\, badass Luke\\, Rey\\, Kylo and Finn. Heartbreaking but strong Leia. Plus not one but two budding romances and some truly epic space battles. Don't listen to negative reviews; this is superb!","true":true}
