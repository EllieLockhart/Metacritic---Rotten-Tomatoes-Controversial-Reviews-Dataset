Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Strange things are going on here. Critics give this movie 93%. Do these critics know how storytelling works? When I went out of this movie\\, I had almost immediately forgotten what the main characters wanted. None of them was relatable and this movie didn't feel like Star WARS\\, it felt like \\\"insignificant uprising in some rural province\\\". It didn't feel like the characters were part of the universe\\, as if they were in a bubble. Everything the original SW did right\\, this new trilogy does wrong. And why did they introduce Snoke in the first place? Huge disappointment and RT should stop making it look like this movie is the shizz\\, because it isn't.","true":true}
