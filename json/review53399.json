Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing is the first word that left my mouth after the credits. BB8 is apparently a superhero all by himself; the Snoke storyline was aweful not to mention we don't even find out who or where Snoke came from; Leia's force use there was out of left field\\, I know she could feel things from the force but that jump to flying in space like superman is a bit much; why don't you just kill off Leia too and make it easy\\, now you have to do something crazy in the next one and I feel it's a little crappy to Carrie Fisher; take the most important character and make him not give a crap about the force....great idea. \\n\\nI went with family and friends and the one scene we talked about more than any was Luke milking that dang sea monster thing.....that tells you what kind of movie it was when that's the scene in everyone mind.... \\n\\nYou F'd up royally Disney and Rian! \\n\\nGeorge call Liam Neeson to get your baby back!","true":true}
