Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some cool scenes with Luke but mostly a merch fest to sell toys and expensive lego star wars casinos. Lacks an overall interesting story and doesn't feel rewarding. The scenes with Finn and the new female sidekick was completly uninteresting and didn't bring the story forward the least\\, the scenes should have been cut in favour of a more interesting adventure that acctually brings the story forward. \\n\\nAlso\\, wtf was that scene with Leia where she decided to float back into the ship like nothing? It felt very out of place and more 2001 then the star wars I love.\\n\\nI figure the problem is that the production have to much money to waste on special effects rather than trying to be clever in the production like they were in 1977\\, aswell as having an overall uninteresting story.\\n\\nHats of to Mark Hamill for the only prefomance that made me stay through the screening.","true":true}
