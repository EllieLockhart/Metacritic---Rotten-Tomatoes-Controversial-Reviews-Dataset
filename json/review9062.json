Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Full of clever twists and turns. With key film elements like stellar acting\\, wirtting\\, and special effects giving it their A game. The last Jedi delivers a powerfuly emotional entry into the franchise that even reaches if not betters the hieghts provided by empire\\, even if some in the fanbase chose to remain salty about disney's direction with the franchise regardless of quality.","true":true}
