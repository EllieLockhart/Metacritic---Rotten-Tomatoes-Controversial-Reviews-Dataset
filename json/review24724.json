Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie was utter garbage and a reflection of the talentless hacks; including writers\\, directors\\, and actors Hollywood is producing. The vacuum of space does not exist and all 8 prior films are absolutely meaningless. This is the \\\"Halloween III\\\" of the Star Wars franchise. Jar-jar has been exonerated as the worst thing to happen to Star Wars. Utter filth and a waste of two and a half hours of this torture.","true":true}
