Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film didn't respect the past instead they destroyed it too many jokes and no link to the new trilogy but the film is shot beautifully and it could of been better than this. expand the universe Disney make new threat for the new order and the rebels that will make it more interesting. ps mabe a fan of force awakens will like it more just too many missed opportunities.","true":true}
