Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Crappy rehash of scenes and elements from the original trilogy\\, crammed with 2017 political correctness and SJW agenda. Horrible pacing\\, not a single lightsaber duel in the entire movie\\, pointless uninteresting side characters\\, ruining the SW universe by randomly changing the rules in ways that make no sense in the context of all previous movies (if you can weaponize hyperdrive like that why didnt they just destroy both Death Stars with it etc.). Disney killed this franchise.","true":true}
