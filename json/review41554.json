Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is exactly what it needed to be for the second film in the sequel trilogy. It gives both the characters and the audience some raw truths that are going to be hard for many to digest. One of the truths this movie presents is that the answers you or the characters are looking for aren't always going to be so clear-cut. People aren't perfectly good or perfectly bad. Your heros make big mistakes and your villains have more humanity than you've given them credit for in the past. Sure\\, this movie has its flaws as every movie does. And no one movie is going to please everybody. But The Last Jedi is unapologetic in the way it presents its story. It's both subtle and striking in ways I cannot fully articulate. It's hauntingly good in a way that will stay with me throughout the rest of my days.","true":true}
