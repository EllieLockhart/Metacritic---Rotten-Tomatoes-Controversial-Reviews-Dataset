Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely loved this movie\\, even more than the original three\\, which to me seemed like comic books brought to the big screen. By contrast\\, The Last Jedi seemed liked an epic\\, exciting FILM\\, which kept me captivated all the way through.","true":true}
