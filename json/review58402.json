Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After the insipid and expensive exercise in fanboyism that was The Force Awakens\\, I was hoping the sequel would pay me back for having to pay full price to sit through a best-of compilation of every previous Star Wars movie but played by different actors. And BOY did The Last Jedi deliver. This franchise got the shot in the arm it needed to stay relevant. It's bold\\, it's funny\\, and it allows it's characters to fail and fail catastrophically. And then it busts out a muppet to talk about it. To the fans who feel hurt and betrayed by this shift in direction... lol what can I say. I loved this movie so much that I don't care.","true":true}
