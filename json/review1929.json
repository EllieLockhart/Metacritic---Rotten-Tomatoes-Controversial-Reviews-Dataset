Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A slap in the face for all that starwars value which OT have accomplished before . \\\"Let the past Die...kill it\\\"? Really? why not pick the good of the past and correct the mistake for the future.It sure that tHis movie cannot stand the Test of time compare the OT. You Cannot the to Surpass the Past OT and sure as hell cannot Kill it Accomplishment","true":true}
