Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it\\, saw it twice and enjoyed it more the second viewing. Yes a few story holes that were left open but the over all movie was terrific. Mark Hamill\\, Carrie Fisher\\, Anthony Daniels\\, Frank Oz of the original cast were amazing added together with the new cast turned out a terrific movie.","true":true}
