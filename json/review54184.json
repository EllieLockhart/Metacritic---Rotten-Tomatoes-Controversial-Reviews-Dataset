Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If Rian Johnson was a director of any creative note he could have opined that TLJ was the sum of all his compromises and buried under $200M of producers notes\\, ideological verbiage\\, tentpole trailer moments and focus group copypasta was the palpating heart of Lucas' original trilogy - but he isn't and it certainly hasn't. It is a stinking pile of incoherent triteness\\, cack-handed humour\\, and paper thin caricatures of the original ideas jemmy-barred into a non-plot. It's a confused narrative of losers losing but it's no anti-hero story just a rambling jumble of SW tropes trash compacted together. \\nIt treats its legacy with contempt ignorantly spending its rich canonical inheritance like a trust fund brat.\\nRian Johnson IS a director notable for compliance. It's well known that directors Josh Trank\\, Phil Lord\\, Christopher Miller and Colin Trevorrow have all been sacked from their respective Lucasfilm projects and Gareth Edwards was ordered to reshoot Rogue One. Having a director's vision is a sackable offense at Lucasfilm and in The Last Jedi it shows.\\nIt is interesting that along with Jaws Star Wars heralded in the age of the producer driven concept film and called last drinks for the director driven films of the 70's. A tidy 40 years later the franchise similarly marks the end game of Hollywood\\, a former bright shining star is now a bloated over-inflated gaseous red giant\\, collapsing into its degenerate core.\\nThere will be never again a Godfather\\, Deerhunter\\, Apocalypse Now\\, Cabaret\\, 2001\\, The Mission\\, The Killing Fields\\, Taxi Driver\\, Clockwork Orange\\, Blue Velvet or even The English Patient.\\n\\nWhy? The Last Jedi is why.","true":true}
