Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie accomplished nothing. We are back where the force awaken ended.  You can skip this movie and miss nothing important and probably watch the next one without missing a beat.  So many things gone wrong that could of been right.  A disgrace for Star Wars fans and I'm not even a hardcore wars fan. Don't know if there were creative differences with Disney and the director or just Disney being safe and take no chances.  This really took the whole saga a step back. Just hope JJ can take it to the next level on the next episode.","true":true}
