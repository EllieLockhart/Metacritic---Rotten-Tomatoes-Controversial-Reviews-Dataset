Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall a complete waste of time. Last Jedi is nothing more than flashy effects\\, cheap gimmicks and vague interpretations of good and evil to give the illusion its smart. When in reality its just as dumb as a standard Michael Bay Transformers film. Plot lines go absolutely no where both new and old characters have absolutely no common sense or go against their basic principles with little to no explanation and the entire experience is just jarring. \\n\\nIt's almost as if they were trying to make a movie worse the phantom menace","true":true}
