Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointed with this movie! It had so much potential and even though it's visually stunning (other than Snoke's CGI)\\, Disney have turned Star Wars into a politically correct\\, let's tick as many diversity boxes as possible whilst eroding everything that we love about Star Wars\\, kids film. Rubbish storyline\\, wasted characters and a worse script.  As an avid Star Wars fan this is simply awful.","true":true}
