Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked this film overall but i was waiting to be completely amazed and thrilled by it like the Force Awakens. I am not the biggest fan but I still love the saga. This film had a lot of memorable and amazing scenes but also unsatisfying awnsers and subplotes that led to nowhere. Overall enjoyable but not perfect.","true":true}
