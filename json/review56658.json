Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was a badly written and badly directed movie. Felt like I was watching a made for TV movie and not the newest Star Wars installment. The characters suddenly were missing all the development and personality that TFA gave them. The movie forces you to try and like nazi-like characters and to hate the actual heroes of the story. Overall\\, just a bad and disappointing film where the best parts were the crystal critters\\, porgs\\, and maybe two moments that were halfway decent.\\n\\nJ.J. Abrams\\, you're our only hope.","true":true}
