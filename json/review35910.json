{"101487":175559,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-24","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi just wasn't my cup of tea. I love Star Wars\\, followed the old Expanded Universe very closely\\, and it is probably my favorite of all the fictional universes I follow. I am also good with going in a new direction\\, as long as it is done well. I was wanting a new trilogy to be set far away from the original trilogy to avoid the OT characters really playing any role in the story. With the direction they ended up going with in the Force Awakens and the The Last Jedi\\, I feel it was just a wasted opportunity to bring back all of the OT Characters anyway. \\n\\nPositives:\\n\\n- The CGI and set design in the film looked great. Loved the new ship designs\\, and Casino scenes visually speaking were really great.\\n\\n- Thought all of the acting and casting were great as well. Just had a bad story. \\n\\nNegatives:\\n\\n- I am going to call it David vs Goliath syndrome. In my opinion\\, Star Wars stories far too often get into get into the habit of having the little guy win via a lucky shot\\, some technical flaw\\, or gross bad guy incompetence. Worked great in the original Star Wars\\, Episode IV\\, but it becomes so ridiculous it happening time after time\\, that the villains become a non-threat. \\n\\nWith that said\\, Poe taking down a the First Order Dreadnought was not fun to watch. First the Dreadnought seemed to have no shields and very minimal defenses\\, which doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Then why did the Dreadnought open fire on the empty base first instead of the Star Cruiser with everyone on it? It could not fire with various weapons at both targets simultaneously? Why did all of those other Star Destroyers do nothing the entire time? \\n\\n- Then the slow speed chase through space was just silly IMO. The First Order Flagship the Supremacy\\, is almost 38 miles across and it felt like it was firing from a single turbolaser canon the whole time. Also\\, so the First Order had not a single warship or long range weapon that could overcome the Resistance fleet\\, doesn't make much sense. No First Order ship could have made a short hyperspace jump to get in front of the fleet\\, or get to the planet Crait first? All the while the Resistance had two ships jump out of hyperspace in the middle of the chase without issue. Just a big plot hole for me. Also missiles from the TIE fighters seem to slip through shields with ease\\, why couldn't one high yield warhead blow up that cruiser for good in the opening shots of that battle?      \\n\\n- The whole hyperspace kamikaze scene. In the old expanded universe\\, I was a big fan of seeing hyperspace\\, or kinetic energy\\, weapons being used to take ships and even entire planets. Makes perfect sense with the technology at hand. However\\, planetary or ship based shields usually rendered such weapons less effective\\, or by having an Interdictor in place. This movie tells another story. If nothing can protect against such suicide jumps then why haven't we seen that more often. I mean if an X-Wing could just hyperspaced jumped into the Death Star\\, or make a missile that could quickly take out any Imperial ship.  \\n\\n- Once you get to Crait\\, what is the point of the whole ground battle. With maybe 20 plus Star Destroyers in orbit\\, none have any weapons to launch an orbital strike. There didn't seem to be any shielding in place like Hoth. I know in the old EU\\, an ISD could melt the surface of a planet on its own\\, but surely any space faring power in the Star Wars Galaxy should put our current real world weapons yields to shame.  \\n\\n- Then of course there are what I feel wasted characters. Was looking forward to much more from Snoke and Phasma in terms of being great villains. Admiral Ackbar deserved a much better send off as well. Of course then there is Luke. No problem with him dying\\, but need to go out in an actual blaze of glory\\, not a holographic one.    \\n\\n- Back to point above\\, Star Wars for me is about having great villains. Between the David vs Goliath syndrome\\, and with only Kylo and Hux remaining\\, the villains feel\\, moody\\, non-threatening and incompetent. The Empire of Episode IV and V seemed unbeatable\\, and to some extent in Episode VI\\, ignoring some of the Ewok and space battle silliness.   \\n\\n- Overall\\, got to say it was really boring for a Star Wars movie. No matter what I thought about the other seven movies\\, there was always a moment in them\\, when flipping through the channels\\, I would stop and watch the movie for that moment. With Last Jedi there were no such memorable moments for me. \\n\\nFor all of the genre movies I have seen say over the last 10 years\\, the unholy trilogy of disappointment would have to be The Last Jedi\\, Batman vs Superman\\, and Iron Man 3. IMO\\, the MCU recovered from Iron-Man 3 pretty well\\, and even retconned some bad ideas. The DCEU is a lost cause for me\\, can't wait for the reboot. After Last Jedi\\, I think there still is hope of a strong recovery like the MCU\\, so I will remain optimistic for more standalone movies and Episode 9.","true":true}
