Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly\\, it was terrible. Genuine pantomime villains hamming it up badly and a Chuck Norris (beard only) ending from Luke. The CGI was crap - the forces exerted by the critters just didn't look at all real and the spaceships that boringly trudged through space looking for a handy gas station would have been better done on a PC version of Homeworld. ... and there's just too much about the plotting and the set pieces and the 2-D moral-baiting lines and Mary Poppins and rubbishy looking aliens and lack of scope (despite the grand size of ships and planets\\, it all seemed to be happening in a cheap studio or green-screen environment). It is really bad.\\nOne ends up being cheered by spotting a cameo appearance\\, but then feeling sorry that these actors got caught up in this mess. Very disappointed that Finchy from \\\"The Office\\\" didn't get to deliver any lines\\, Adrian from \\\"The Young Ones\\\" should have donated some of his.","true":true}
