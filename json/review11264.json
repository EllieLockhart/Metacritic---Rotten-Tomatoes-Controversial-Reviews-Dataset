{"101487":127959,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly the Last Jedi for me is just a overhyped dud... Hate that snoke didnt get more screen time\\, Finn and the Asian girl planet exploring a total waste of time and made the movie feel 2 hours longer than it is\\, Lukes big moment is OP\\, and why didn't Leia move the rocks?","true":true}
