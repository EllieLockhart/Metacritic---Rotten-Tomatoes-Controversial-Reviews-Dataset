Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this was an awful movie the writer seems like they didn't care for consistency at all. Plot points were set up in TFA and it seems like the director didnt care at all to maintain points not a good movie at all.","true":true}
