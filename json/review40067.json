Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not the typical\\, easy to watch (albeit not always so easy to really understand as we saw on many online forums after the force awakens) SW movie. But it's amazing. It should be seen more than once\\, first impact is harsh\\, and it's so dark that hurts. But it's really worth watching. It's really GREAT. Thank you Rian Johnson.","true":true}
