Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"HATERS GOTTA HATE.\\nHave never posted a review on RT before\\, but after seeing the negative fan press out there regarding 'The Last Jedi'\\, I felt moved to voice my own opinion. And that's all it is\\, I guess: my opinion. 'New Hope' was the first movie I ever saw in a cinema as a child - it inspired me then ... and in the intervening years\\, the Star Wars franchise has continued to provide a wellspring of inspiration (yes\\, even the prequels). I'm still processing 'Last Jedi' - there was so much to take in - but I am already convinced it is 'one of the best' for so many reasons. Like 'New Hope'\\, it is bold and opens up a whole galaxy of possibilities for future story telling. To all all the 'heart sinkers' out there that take delight in 'pulling the wings off butterflies'? Please don't lose sight of what this film will mean for the FUTURE of Star Wars. My children LOVED this film. Unreservedly. And so did my wife and I!","true":true}
