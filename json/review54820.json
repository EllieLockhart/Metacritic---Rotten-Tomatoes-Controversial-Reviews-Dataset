Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought The Last Jedi was a great movie. Rian Johnson wrote and directed arguably one of the best Star Wars movies up to this point. Every moment was powerful and emotionally moving. The plot moved through the 2.5 hour runtime flawlessly. Regardless what people may think about Johnson killing off Snoke and revealing (and\/or possibly redirecting) who Rey\u2019s parents were\\, Johnson took Star Wars into a different direction\\, leaving the original trilogy in past and bringing the fans of Star Wars (including myself) toward something new and fresh. People who thought TLJ wasn\u2019t a true Star Wars movie\\, they\u2019re not letting themselves be open to something different in this fantastic universe. I\u2019m looking forward to see what J.J Abrams does to finish off this new trilogy in Episode IX. ","true":true}
