Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Utterly terrible movie. How this has a 91% rating from \\\"critics\\\" is beyond me. A minor drip started happening in my house during me watching this film and I was more interested in finding the drip than finishing this garbage. Do not waste any money on this.","true":true}
