Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was disgrace for all the star wars saga. All the characters that we've seen before on episodes IV\\, V and VI lack of matureness and wisdom. It doesn't feel like a true star wars movie. With Luke Skywalker acting so selfishly and scared of what would happen if he had truly trained Ray. After all\\, it had great scenes and everything but\\, as I've said before\\, it wasn't a true Star Wars film.","true":true}
