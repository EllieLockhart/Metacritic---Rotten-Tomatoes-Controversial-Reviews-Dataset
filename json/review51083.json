Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely dreadful movie.  Beautifully filmed with great fx - in fact possibly the best-looking Star Wars movie to date - but in every other way a pile of rubbish that desecrates the legacy and memory of a beloved franchise.  I thought that the Force Awakens had already killed Star Wars and found it depressing; but this piece of incoherent tripe stomps on the grave and spits on the headstone - and it makes me angry.","true":true}
