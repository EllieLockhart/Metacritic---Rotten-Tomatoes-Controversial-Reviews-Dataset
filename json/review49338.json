Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie- worse then the prequels\\, lack of depth character development and moronic plotlines that destroy the legacy of the hero of the original trilogy- Luke Skywalker. If you are expecting some answers to the questions raised in the force awakens you will be very disappointed. Rian Johnsons ego took over\\, he wanted to create a new Star Wars which now resembles the Twilight series. His admission that he was not making the movie for the fans but for himself is quite telling- the Star Was franchise will make money but Disney have destroyed the magic that it once was and robbed us of the best memories from our childhood.","true":true}
