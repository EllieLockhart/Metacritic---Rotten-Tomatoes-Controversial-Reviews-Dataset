Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Trash\\, and Disney refusing to giving their movies to reviewers unless they give good reviews makes all of the good reviews null and void","true":true}
