Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For me\\, it was not a perfect movie. I was expecting a lot more Star Wars mythology to come out of this movie. All my theories were shut down and to me\\, that was a bit of a let down. Reys parents and Snokes identity were the topics i was most interested in walking into the movie theater\\, walking-out i felt shut down in a way. Either way\\, i had fun watching this movie. I know the run time was close to 150 minutes but i felt like that went by sooo fast.","true":true}
