Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is a big disappointment. There is no intelligent\\, fresh plot. No epicness that LUCAS's movies had. they just use what we saw before and add some lousy job script in between. They just assumed that in every movie they are going to kill one of the original heroes - heroes loved by billions\\, heroes that made star wars great. and there is nothing to replace them. new heroes are cheap\\, flat\\, they will be quickly forgotten. disney should have left lucas legacy alone and try to create their own cult. but no\\, they decided to make these predictible\\, miserable movies\\, destroy star wars\\, upset fans\\, and earn some dollars. thank you for destroying star wars disney\\, i will never again go to cinema to see star wars movie and i will never again buy a product related to this franchise\\, that is my way to protest. new star wars team has the money\\, but don't have the knowledge and skills to make star wars as great as lucas was able to make them. it is a cheap movie with star wars logo attached.","true":true}
