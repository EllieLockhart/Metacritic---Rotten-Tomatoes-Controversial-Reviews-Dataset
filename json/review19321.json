Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's not what fan boys wanted and it's not what casual viewers expected. But it's one the best movies ever made and we deserve it. If you understand what makes a story compelling\\, what makes characters intriguing and what makes good film making\\, it is inevitable you will like this movie. If you are not\\, this movie will seem chaotic\\, disappointing and pointless. And to those who think that\\, I'm sorry\\, the future will prove you wrong. Let yourself appreciate this narrative for what it is and not what has been imposed by childish demands. \\nSpeaking of which\\, people seem to be forgetting that this is a film that also has to be suitable to younger audiences. Perhaps Rian Johnson tried too hard in this aspect but\\, nonetheless\\, he does not deserve the wave of hate that has been lambasting him and his work. It has flaws\\, yes\\, and certainly does 'feel' different from all pervious star wars instalments. But this is a masterpiece of cinematic spectacle\\, narrative genius\\, great acting\\, powerful visual style and nuance tone.","true":true}
