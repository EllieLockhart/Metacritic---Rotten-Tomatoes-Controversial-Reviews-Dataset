We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Good graphics and game play.  The story is just sad.  They kill off Joel\\, Ellie becomes a tormented soul who loses everything\\, and the only redeeming quality comes from Abby\\, Joel's killer. What's worse is that you have no choice in the matter to show mercy at any point in the game.  You are forced to kill.\rThen there is actual sex in the game\\, along with drug use\\, you see a pregnant woman get killed and your dog. If they had a good story\\, this game would have been great. It doesn't.  It's like Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull or the Star wars sequels or the last few episodes of Game of Thrones where characters turn bad for no reason at all..  There are several times when you think the game is going to fix things\\, but they only make it worse. The story was what made the Original Last of Us Epic. Buy this game when it goes on sale. The game play was fun\\, but the story was like it was made for 2020! We wanted a good game\\, we ended up getting a tragedy that disappoints and is depressing. It makes playing the whole first game pointless. All of the turnover at Naughty Dog explains why we got this crap.  They really emphasize gay and trans characters\\, to the point that they really want to use it as a main plot line\\, and a built in excuse that anyone that doesn't like the story they can say well they are just bigots and homophobes. The truth is they have a depressing story that everyone hates\\, whether you are gay\\, trans\\, or straight. Ugh!  If this is the future of gaming\\, then the gaming future is doomed.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
