Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I created an account just to BEG true Star Wars fans NOT to see this movie.  The other reviews will explain the many reasons.  It will render childhood memories obsolete.  \\n\\nI saw it twice.\\n\\nThe first I walked out of there thinking\\, \\\"do I hate this or love this?\\n\\nHad to see it a second time\\, and said\\, \\\"omg\\, I hate this movie\\\" \\n\\nI despise Arianna Johnson for what he did to my Star Wars.  I hate Disney for what they did to my Star Wars.  Was so pissed\\, I canceled my family trip to Disneyland.  Going to Legoland instead.  Kids not too pleased.  Son understands.  He was bored.  \\n\\nThey need to bring George Lucas in and fix this!  For the dvd release\\, PLEASE reshoot this movie.  Save this thing!  I realize that's unrealistic\\, but Disney just crapped on half their Star Wars fan boys.\\n\\nSad face.  :(","true":true}
