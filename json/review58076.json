Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst anticipated movie of all time.  Nothing and I mean nothing from this day forward will take this title away from this monstrosity.  If Disney had gone with their own crap characters we could of just laughed this tripe off but no they got personal by marketing this as a star wars movie and drew the real fans in and left them with pain and suffering.  Am I sad no Am I angry no I just don't care anymore for this garbage or future crap.  They obviously had no clue what to do from the farce awakens.  I don't blame the director here Disney are at massive fault.  They had no direction we can see it.  What amazes me is how did no one in the production crew not turn around and say something like wait a minute that's not right that dosnt make any sense.  Where is the story\\, where is the imagination of planets aliens.  There is nothing.  Im refusing to accept the future journey of han luke and leia.  Its an insult and disgrace.  Mark boycott the next one please.  They don't have even any threatening villians for the next one for gods sake.  oh yes rey will be announced as rens sister oh wow great reveal Disney.  Its garbage","true":true}
