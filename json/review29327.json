Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy thought it would be a good idea to completely disrespect the legacy of Luke Skywalker in the name of social justice. Then they had the gall to try and discredit the fans negative reviews by claiming a small group of fanboys used bots to drive down the approval rating. A first year filmmaking student could've made this movie successful among the fan base. Not only is The Last Jedi the worst Star Wars movie ever made\\, it seriously jeopardizes the future of the franchise.","true":true}
