We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I can already tell based on a lot of these reviews\\, and to be fair there are a LOT of them\\, that the devs are just gonna dismiss any negativity based on these cringe redpilled reviews that are just mad about there being trans characters in the game or whatever. The trans character was a pretty well fleshed out character\\, and I don't think them being trans was that forced\\, so that part of the narrative was okay.\rBut the way this game just tries to shove the message about revenge or whatever down your throat is such an ostentatious **** show. The players spent an entire game getting to know and love Joel and Ellie\\, and within the first 2 hours some random **** just brutally kills Joel. Little did we know\\, we're meant to just feel like **** for the entire game. And after this psycho puts on her sadistic display\\, we're then forced to play as her for half the game\\, and the devs try to basically show off and have a 'dynamic character' or whatever and try to impress us by turning our perspective around. 'Look\\, the dog you killed is her dog!' or 'the surgeon you killed was her dad!'\rAbby is a dick even to her own friends\\, there's nothing likeable about her. Literally nothing. There is no overlap between Abby's moral circle and the player's. So the devs just kill like all the characters and give Abby a **** ton of plot armour\\, and just until the very last microsecond keep hammering it into our skulls 'revenge bad! revenge bad! revenge bad! revenge bad!' and 'you're just like Abby! you're just like Abby! you're just like Abby! YOU'RE JUST LIKE ABBY! YOU'RE JUST LIKE ABBY!'. It's just so poorly done.\rA dynamic plot like this should feel natural\\, and it just doesn't. The message is too transparent. We spend the whole game rooting for Ellie and co. just to have this gory fanfic slapped down in front of us on a silver platter of good graphics and guitar simulation.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
