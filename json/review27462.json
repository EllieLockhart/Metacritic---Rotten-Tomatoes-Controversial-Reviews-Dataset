Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall a massively missed opportunity\\, some great scenes and individual moments\\, but it's crippled by a poor overarching plot that should have been dropped at the first draft\\, poor pacing and inconsistencies with previous movies.","true":true}
