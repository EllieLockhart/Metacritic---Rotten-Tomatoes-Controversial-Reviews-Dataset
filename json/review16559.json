Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Incoherent\\, SJW garbage that ruined Star Wars and the eight film in the saga. This movie is so bad I'd pay to see a remake as I cannot accept this trash as part of the series. Luke was way off from the character we knew and loved from the Original Trilogy and the total mess of \\\"strong female characters\\\" overshadow the story itself with a massive gut feeling of a leftist political agenda behind the scenes. I strongly recommend you avoid witnessing this massive mistake and misuse of cinema.","true":true}
