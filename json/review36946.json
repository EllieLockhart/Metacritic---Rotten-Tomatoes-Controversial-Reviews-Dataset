Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was interesting and at certain moments exhilarating\\, but the good news ends there. The screenwriting was clumsy\\, never letting an emotion be savored before shattering it with humor or action. The character development (especially that of Poe and Finn) moved backwards\\, as Finn attempted desertion and Poe (trusted already with a leader's role in the Resistance) making obviously boneheaded decisions. I choose not to waste words on the trainwreck characters that Luke and Kylo became. My greatest qualm with this dismal film is its complete disregard for the rest of Star Wars. In reference to multiple instances (including Leia's spacewalk and Luke's tele-projection)\\, I simply reply with a line from Han in episode VII: \\\"That's not how the force works!\\\" In the space of a couple hours\\, Rian has fundamentally changed what he was asked to proudly continue. I don't think I could have been more disappointed with this movie and it's attitude toward the rest of the series. As the cherry on top - the animation work for Yoda was absolutely terrible\\, something which is hard to believe in a production such as this. Two stars.","true":true}
