Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A beautiful epic that steers the Star Wars saga into an unexpected direction. Leave all you fan theories and questions at the door. If you DEMAND those answers\\, this isn't the movie you are looking for. A movie that requires multiple viewings to completely appreciate...you are welcome. This layered journey will not disappoint\\, if you allow it to reveal itself. Agendas aside\\, this wonderfully crafted film shows that the Star Wars universe is in very good hands. Rian Johnson and his team have made a film to be proud of. Their passion is evident in every scene. You may disagree with the choices\\, but you cannot argue that the finished film is Star Wars through and through. A film that transistions the old mythos to the new. It leaves the Star Wars universe with full fleshed out hero's and villains that all other film franchises will envy. This film entertains while creating a blank canvas for the new chapter. Though some may disagree\\, Stars Wars has never been in a better place. Well done.","true":true}
