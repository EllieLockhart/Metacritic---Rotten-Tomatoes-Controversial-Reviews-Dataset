Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No idea why this movie is getting review bombed ( snowflake metldown season? )\\, it's a great Star Wars movie\\, it isn't perfect and it has plot holes\\, but being a Star Wars watcher from childhood\\, having seen the original trilogy with starry wide eyes as a kid\\, then the prequels as an early adult and finally this latest. I see no other reason than perhaps self-entitled pissed off Star Wars fans nitpicking and just not sitting back to enjoy the show.\\n\\nDo yourself a favor\\, ignore the snowflake meltdowns\\, watch it\\, enjoy it for what it is\\, a space action flick\\, that's it.\\n\\nCheers!","true":true}
