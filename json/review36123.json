Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was amazing! Some questions get answered and fans don't like the answers. Some things happen that the fans didn't think should. We've had two years between movies\\, and a lot of thoughts and ideas on what is going to happen build up in that amount of time. As an avid fan\\, I went in without preconceived notions and absolutely loved it\\, and have seen it twice already.","true":true}
