Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am severely disappointed by this movie. I expected a fresh star wars movie after introducing the series to new fans with the force awakens. What we got was a mosh pit of re-hashed pieces from Empire Strikes Back and Return Of The Jedi\\, poor attempts at humor\\, bad characters\\, bad writing. I would rather watch any of the prequels then this again.","true":true}
