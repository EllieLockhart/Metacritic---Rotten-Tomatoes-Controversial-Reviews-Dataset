Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it. I sat in the theatres for the 1st movies (4\\, 5\\, and 6) and was in awe. 1\\, 2\\, and 3 were terrible\\, absolute trash. I'm no fan of Disney but all of reviews are ridiculous. I'm not sure what movie everyone was watching but The Last Jedi restored some hope\\, at least to myself\\, that the franchise is heading\\, back\\, in the right direction. Can't wait to see the next one. ","true":true}
