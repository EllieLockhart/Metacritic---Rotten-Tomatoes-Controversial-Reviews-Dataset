Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After a long time waiting\\, This was totally worth it. The Last Jedi isn't the clich\u00e9 story we have been hoping for\\, It was far better then expected. It was exciting and new. The only thing I disliked were the unnecessary jokes at some points like Luke throwing the lightsaber over his shoulder.","true":true}
