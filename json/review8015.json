Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fake 90+ Tomato Meter.  Easily the worst movie ever due to its many failures in writing and execution.  Nothing in it makes sense or relates back to the original trilogy and in fact intentionally stomps on the fans.","true":true}
