Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a fan of star wars my entire life. I even own original vhs of the original trilogy Pre-Special edition. This movie stands on it's shoulders and pretends it got here on its own.\\nThe Last Jedi is an insult to the mythology\\, story\\, and heart of star wars. Ripping g out the soul of one of the franchises most beloved characters. It uses the phrase \\\"let the past dies\\, kill it if you have to\\\" which this movie has done. It chooses to pretendd that the other movies do not exist and makes an attempt to kill it. Aside from the utter assassination of a beloved franchise. This move is structurally and functionally flawed. The pacing is all over\\, plot lines go no where. Character hide things with no clear reason or motive at the detriment of their own goals. There is a maximum of 2 stand out moments that are shallow and shot lives.\\nBad movie\\, and an insulting star wars movie.","true":true}
