Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Does the casino planet plot point go on for a little too long? Sure\\, I'll give you that. Is DJ pretty useless? Yup. But everything else is flat-out amazing. The scenes between Luke Skywalker and Rey are not only engaging\\, but even philosophical at times.\\n\\nThe imagery of certain locations could be hung as a painting\\, the characters are vastly interesting\\, and while this might not be the best movie in the Star Wars franchise\\, it still has some of the best scenes and mythology in the Star Wars franchise.\\n\\n9\/10","true":true}
