Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Beautiful graphics and interesting story. Wonderfully unpredictable and dares to go new directions. The two stars come from it unfortunately not feeling like a star wars movie at all. Like Rogue One\\, it's a wonderful story\\, but not what I want to see when thinking of Star Wars. Except for a few Characters (Luke\\, Rose\\, Poe\\, Leia)\\, I cannot care about any of them. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver present a powerful and masterful performance\\, however their characters feel like fan-fiction and unnecessary. Worth a watch\\, but the series has lost my interest with this installment\\, and I will not be holding my breath for the next one.","true":true}
