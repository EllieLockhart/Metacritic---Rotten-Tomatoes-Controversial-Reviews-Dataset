Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Any debate as to this movie \\\"going in a new direction\\\" is quickly nulled by the poorly paced script and glaring plot holes. The story is so contrived as to be somewhat nonsensical. You have to do more than suspend disbelief to enjoy this movie...you have to throw it away right along with the script to \\\"The Force Awakens\\\".","true":true}
