Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Though it has some flaws\\, Last Jedi was fresh and fun\\, both calling back to Star Wars nostalgia and being a new direction. I've seen it twice already and plan to see it many more times!","true":true}
