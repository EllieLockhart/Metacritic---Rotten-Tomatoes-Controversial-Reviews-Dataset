Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As always Star Wars has brought awe and amazement with locations\\, creatures and back story. But I just can't justify Luke being one of the main comic reliefs. It almost made me question if he's actually the chosen one\\, since when does the main hero give up and run away? I would have rather seen him strong from start to end. I do appreciate all the other acts or heroism but once again the deaths of main characters should have been more tear jerking scenes.","true":true}
