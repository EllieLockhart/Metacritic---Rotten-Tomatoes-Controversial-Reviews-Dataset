Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't get me wrong\\, I love Star Wars\\, but this\\, this was a montrocity. It had way to many plot holes\\, it made everything Luke did in Return of the Jedi irrelivant\\, and I could go on. The only good thing about this movie is the CGI and the visual effects.","true":true}
