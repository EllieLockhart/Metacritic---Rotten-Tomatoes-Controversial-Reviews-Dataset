Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi has been released for digital download a week ago but... it is not listed in the top 20 DVD & STREAMING MOVIES (and it never will).\\n\\nWhat's going on\\, Disney????\\n\\nSuch a beautiful\\, bold\\, fresh Star Wars movie\\, the best of them all\\, bla bla bla... and it does not make to the top 20?\\n\\nWhat a bummer! \\n\\nPeople (I mean\\, the ones you did not pay for praising it) HATE this movie and will not pay for watching it again.","true":true}
