Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For those of us that grew up with the original trilogy (which include RIan Johnson)\\, I find it baffling that he would butcher Luke & Leia in the fashion he did.  Given that his movie Looper was a pretty good film\\, I am left to imagine that the Disney execs were very heavy handed in their involvement with this film and dictated that their themes be included at all costs.  This movie is a pretty to look at and not much else as the story is discombobulated.  I realize the franchise must move forward and the past must die but this film as a whole did a huge disservice to the legion of fans that helped build it into what has now become a brain dead sci-fi series with no heart.  Disney acquiring Lucasfilm is now in hindsight a huge disappointment .  Letting the past die and never watching another SW film.  For all of you that rave about how great this film is\\, enjoy your future installments of... whatever the hell this movie was.","true":true}
