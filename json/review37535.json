Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There can be no doubt anymore that the makers of the modern Star Wars films harbor explicit intentions to dismantle that which delivered us this beloved franchise and universe in the first place.  The beating heart of the hero's journey has been excised from its husk and replaced by episodic scripts with little overarching purpose\\, and blaring left-leaning political subtext as often as the writers could muster it.  While these films continue to bear the face of Star Wars and our attendant nostalgia continues to draw us to the box office\\, their makers have silently gutted the original archetypes and contents and replaced them for  quick\\, repeated\\, extremely transparent swipes at all carriers of a Y-chromosome\\, as well as a new meaningless\\, incoherent portrayal of The Force\\, which shows up when it likes\\, means whatever it wants\\, and escapes value or even conceptualization.  The new masters of these films are of course free to alter the entirety of the legacy they inherited.  I hope it serves them well.  However\\, they have utterly lost me and untold others with this new thinly-veiled political\\, post-modern dog's breakfast of a film.","true":true}
