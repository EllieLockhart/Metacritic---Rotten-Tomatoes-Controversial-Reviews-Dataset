Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible\\, poorly conceived movie that disrespects the entire saga with an unpalpable plot and saltless characters' performances. All of that allied to an unlikely inorganic comeout\\, that fails to surprise the smallest child in the audience much less a SW franchise fan. That makes one wonder how much money Disney payed RT or how credible are their critics to give a 91% percent rate on this Johnson's poop garbage.","true":true}
