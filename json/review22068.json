Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Kathleen Kennedy: \\\"Listen\\, Disney\\, I want to make a feminazi movie and slap it into the faces of the fascists\/male chauvinist\/wealthy people out there\\, so I will use a well established franchise\\, loved by those fascists and lure them to the theaters where I will shove all my propaganda up their asses\\\".\\nDisney: \\\"OK\\, we will make sure that those people believe they are gonna go watching a real Star Wars movie by threatening the critics who want to tell the truth and bribing the ones who are easily bought with free tickets to the premieres\\\".\\nKathleen Kennedy: \\\"OK\\, I need a cinema student as director because every real director out there knows that this will be his last job and his career will be ruined\\\".\\nDisney: \\\"OK\\, let lure some cinema student to do the dirty job by promising him that he will be directing a brand new Star Wars trilogy in the future.\\\"\\nKathleen Kennedy: \\\"Very good. I have already prepared the blueprint for the critics. All positive critics must contain the words: The Last Jedi is fresh and new\\, bold choices by the director\\, unexpected twists\\, the Star Wars for the new generation\\, the best Star Wars movie ever made\\, ans so on\\\".\\nDisney: \\\"OK\\, who is the idiot you have chosen for this project?\\\"\\nKathleen Kennedy: \\\"Rian Johnson\\\"\\nDisney: \\\"Who?\\\"\\nKathleen Kennedy: \\\"A friend of mine. We met at the local The Force Is Female club. He is soo meek\\\".\\nDisney: \\\"OK\\, we will need to describe him as a real director\\, though. At least before the screening of the movie\\, or no one will come and watch it. Ah\\, Kathy\\, one more thing\\\".\\nKathleen Kennedy: \\\"What\\, Disney?\\\"\\nDisney: \\\"People will be outraged by discovering that we lured them to see something and gave them our shit instead\\\".\\nKathleen Kennedy: \\\"Who cares? We will tell our friends in the press industry to describe them as fascists\\, \tmale chauvinist\\, stupid cunts\\\".\\nDisney: \\\"And what about Rotten Tomatoes\\, IMDB and the others?\\\"\\nKathleen: \\\"We will need damage control of course. Lots of it. I want at least 100 shills\\, ready to flood those sites with positive critics and scores at least for the first 2 weeks\\\".\\nDisney: \\\"You will get them. Moreover\\, we will tell our friends at Rotten Tomatoes that the score must not fall under 49%. If it does... well... they will not be friends of ours anymore. Do you know what I mean?\\\"\\nKathleen: \\\"Of course I do.\\\"\\nDisney: \\\"OK\\, let's destroy this male chauvinistic shit that is Star Wars.\\\"","true":true}
