Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a long time star wars fan\\, i feel that the last jedi could not capture the essence\\, charm\\, or wonder of the star wars universe. Instead\\, the movie attempts to distract the audience with cheap humor\\, disjointed subplots\\, and unnecessary twists.\\n\\nInstead of gracefully passing the torch to the new generation of heroes\/villains\\, Disney and Rian Johnson make it overtly clear to the audience that they have no regard for heroes and villains of the original trilogy. These legends of the past were to be simply discarded and the audience is told to \\\"let the past die\\\".\\n\\nThe original trilogy\\, and even the prequels\\, were better able to capture the wonder\\, excitement\\, and magic of the star wars universe. The audience could easily fall in love with the rebel alliance and its heroes as well as feel the might and strength of the galactic empire. The last jedi instead left an impression of a confused and insubordinate resistance\\, and a lost and inept first order.\\n\\nI loved Rogue One and felt a sense of pride and hope in Disney's direction with Star wars. The force awakens sparked the renewal of a universe of possibilities. The last Jedi took that away that spark and any remaining hope left in this franchise. I am truly saddened and disappointed in Disney for having no regard for the history of the franchise nor its original fan base.","true":true}
