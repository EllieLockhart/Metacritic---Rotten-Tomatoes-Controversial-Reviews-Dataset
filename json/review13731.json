Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If it wasn't for the seemingly slow and sort of filler-esque middle section\\, this would be the perfect action\/adventure movie. A truly fresh and bold take on a saga that was starting to feel too formulaic.","true":true}
