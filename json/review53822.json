Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Haven't seen the movie\\, don't plan to. I'm writing this to express my displeasure at Disney's treatment of the fans since Darth Disney was created. In what universe do you crap on your core fanbase for having the nerve to dislike your product\\, then insult those fans even further when they don't spend their money to watch your latest insult to the franchise? Now seeing the reported $50mil Lucasfilm is spending in a retaliatory misinformation and trolling campaign\\, as evidenced by the recent influx of 5* reviews\\, you have seen my last dollar Disney. Star Wars is nothing more than an involuntary victim to you politics and greed imo.\\nI wasnt likely to see the movie in theaters. But when the best personal review I heard was\\, 'it's the worst SW\\, but it's still SW'\\, I felt no desire to see the worst film in the franchise. And for those fanatics out there that insult anyone who didnt like the movie\\, let me ask you something. Who is more nuts? The person willing to walk away and\/or when a good thing has gone rotten\\, or the person that hangs on for dear life\\, admitting the failure\\, but still fanatically sucking the teet. Those of us that don't like current SW simply want it to be better. Those fanatics that only want to tear down the negs by insulting us because we dare not like your Precious\\, you only make yourselves look nuts in the end. For the record\\, this comes from someone who had no problem with the prequels. They had their moments. So no\\, keep your autistic argument that people who complain about TLJ are not and have never been SW fans to yourself. People who were never fans have better things to do than troll you fools.","true":true}
