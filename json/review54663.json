Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In terms of story\\, pacing\\, and staying true to the star wars universe\\, I personally felt it was absolute garbage. Flying space leia is now the largest cinematic troll in my viewing history and I'll never move past that. The space casino scene (as everyone has already stated) was poorly thought out\\, boring\\, and a waste of time. Whatever social issue was trying to be stated by this scene was wasted as it was just poorly written and poorly executed. The amount of plot holes this movie formed for the average SW fan were just too much for this movie to be enjoyable. I was constantly looking at my watch to see when this movie would be over. The humor in this just didn't work like in the previous movie\\, the charm of characters on screen was non existent.  When I rented this movie to watch at home a second time to convince myself this movie isn't complete garbage\\, I found myself skipping chunks of the movie that I just could not bring myself to watch a second time. \\nThat being said\\, there were definitely some positives that I won't deny just because I'm angry about this movie. In terms of cinematography\\, score\\, and FX\\, it definitely met expectations. There are some really cool scenes that exist in this movie that are definitely worth watching a second time. There are also some really interesting ideas presented in this movie that push the star wars lore forward. It's like parts of a really good movie sprinkled over a trash heap. And it breaks my heart to see Carrie Fisher's last full movie wasted in this manner.","true":true}
