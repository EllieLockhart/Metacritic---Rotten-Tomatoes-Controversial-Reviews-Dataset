Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst movie I've seen in quite sometime. It's hard to put into words how they've completely desecrated the Star Wars movie universe and it's almost incomprehensible to imagine how they were able to get away with it. There's not one line\\, not one scene\\, nor one moment in this movie that's worth the film its printed on. Don't bother watching\\, and goodbye Star Wars.","true":true}
