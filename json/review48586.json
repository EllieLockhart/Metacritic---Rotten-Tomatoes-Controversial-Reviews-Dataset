Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worse star wars so far !!! Terrible play of B class actors in blockbuster movie \\,  scenario also 1\/10. Feel like it is done only to make money as they know fans will watch it anyway.\\nBenicio Del Torro played 10min but he was the best .","true":true}
