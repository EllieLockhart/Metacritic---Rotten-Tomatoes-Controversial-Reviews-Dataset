Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm still unsure how to express just how much I disliked this movie. I've been a Star Wars fan for about 20 years now and I remember two years ago sitting at the cinema and being happy that there was finally a female Jedi on screen. I really liked the new characters (mostly Finn and Rey) which made me forgive some of the story choices I did not agree with. And I feel that this movie truly destroyed any goodwill I had towards it. \\n\\nRey got zero character development because apparently it was more important to show her skyping with the guy who killed one of her friends two days ago (honestly the timeline of this movie was ridiculous) and Finn got sidelined into a frankly awful storyline that could have been cut from the movie entirely without changing anything. And if we're talking about awful treatment of characters I should also add Luke. Because I don't know who that guy in the movie was but it definitely wasn't him.\\n\\nI could honestly write several pages about the plotholes\\, the awful jokes and the blatant stealing from both ESB and RotJ but I guess it's all been said before. The only good thing about this movie is that I'm going to save some money in two years time because I'm not watching the next one.","true":true}
