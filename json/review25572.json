Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a big fan of this movie\\, doesn't really answer any of the questions we had from TFA it just gives you more questions.\\n\\nSeems like Disney is giving us the middle finger to the fans and just focussing on the casual viewer.","true":true}
