Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It appears that director Rian Johnson's intention was to completely destroy the Star Wars franchise as a whole. Visually The Last Jedi was stunning and yet the story was a slap in the face to long time fans. Following up on what directors J.J. Abrams and Gareth Edwards accomplished with The Force Awakens and Rogue One\\, director Rian Johnson chose to ignore everything that was established prior to him taking the helm. If Disney wanted to open the franchise up to a great audience\\, alienating the vast fan base was not how they should have done it.","true":true}
