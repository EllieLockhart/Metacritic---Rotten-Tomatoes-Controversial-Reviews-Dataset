Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only way I would have hated this movie more is if Jar Jar Binks was in it...oh wait he was but now he goes by Rose the Mechanic.  She stinks and so does this movie.  No where to go from where this movie left us.  Just don't care anymore and I'm a lifelong fan of these movies.  Done.","true":true}
