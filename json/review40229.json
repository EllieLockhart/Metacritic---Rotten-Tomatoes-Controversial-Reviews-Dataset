Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not the movie you are looking for:\\n-For a 2 and half hour movie\\, this movie had time for scenes that were literally a waste of time\\n-Take the first scene\\, for example\\, great opening space fight scene was immediately ruined when they show Rose's sister and her trying to drop the bombs. Why did we need to slow the scene down to be invested in a character we dont know about or care about?\\n-Why did we even have the Finn\/Rose storyline? They literally had zero effect on the movie. Nothing they did mattered. \\n-Why kill off the supreme leader? Why not kill him in the third movie?\\n-Why in the heck did we only have one light saber scene?\\n-We wasted Luke\\, why not show up at end and at least take out some first order stuff before he dies. \\n-We also killed the wrong skywalker...\\n\\nThis movie was really a let down.","true":true}
