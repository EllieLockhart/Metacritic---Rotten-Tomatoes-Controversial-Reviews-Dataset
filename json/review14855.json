Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I honestly didn't like The Last Jedi that much. I can't go into details without spoiling things\\, but the plot was a meandering\\, pointless pileup of shaggy dog stories. And it violates the cardinal rule of Star Wars: Star Wars is pulp. Star Wars was Lucas's love letter to the Republic serials he grew up with. The meat of Star Wars is carved from the pulp magazines of the 1930s and 1940s\\, updated for the times by seasoning it with then-modern cinematic influences (e.g. Kurosawa). The Last Jedi is not Star Wars. There's nothing pulpy about this movie. It's pretentious\\, and it violates every rule of good storytelling.\\n\\nThe action was good\\, though. And unlike The Force Awakens\\, we actually got some new worlds with impressive visuals. And I like Rey\\, Finn\\, and Rose. And Leia was Carrie Fisher playing herself\\, which was awesome (RIP). Poe is the worst\\, though.","true":true}
