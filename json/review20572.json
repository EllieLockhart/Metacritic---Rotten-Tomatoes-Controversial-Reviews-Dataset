Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never felt the need to write a review for a movie until this one I love the Star Wars films and have grown up with them\\, but this was an utter disappointment to the name. I just cannot believe the holes in the story as well as how some \\\"big\\\" reveals were done along with the overall disjointed non-Star Wars feel to the story. 10\/10 biggest film making disappointment of the year.","true":true}
