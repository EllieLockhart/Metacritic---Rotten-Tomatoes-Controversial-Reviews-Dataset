Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a Star Wars fan since 1977 with Empire Strikes Back as my favorite. I watched The Last Jedi three times already. The movie connects the teachings of Qui-Gon Jinn\\, the mistakes of Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi\\, the struggles of Anakin\\, and the impulsive nature of Luke Skywalker. It shows the strength of Leia Organa. Those who hated her Mary Poppins scene - my first thought was Chris Pratt and Zoe in Guardians of the Galaxy. I love Rey\\, Ben\\, Poe and Finn. The battle scenes seemed tedious to me\\, but the story was good. This is a movie for a new generation of Star Wars fans.","true":true}
