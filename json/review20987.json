Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was let down by The Force Awakens\\, I was let down by Rogue One\\, and I've never been more insulted than by The Last Jedi. Here's a fun game to play; go through the reviews here\\, and every time you see a 5 Star review\\, read it\\, and see if they ever actually talk about what they liked about The Last Jedi. I guarantee you\\, you'll just see the same generic\\, non-specific\\, cookie-cutter 'praises' of how well the characters were written \/ portrayed\\, or how good the themes were\\, or how incredible the plot \/ sub-plot writing was\\, but not once will you ever actually see any detailed commentary about WHY it's good. The only thing you'll see from the 5 Star reviews for this move are bland\\, generic\\, and never mention anything specific\\, assuming they mention anything that was in the movie itself.\\n\\nAlso\\, to anyone who wants to rail against someone by claiming how pathetic it is that anyone could make a nearly three-hour review on just the first forty minutes of the movie\\, stop and think about how many problems such a movie would have to have to take nearly three hours to get through talking about just the first forty minutes of it.\\n\\nFace it\\, the movie's a dud\\, and Mark Hamill tried to warn us. I hope he agreed to do Episode IX just so that Disney-LucasFilm will cut him another cheque despite how hard it's going to bomb.","true":true}
