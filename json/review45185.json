Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unlike many fans\\, I focused on the good parts of the movie instead of the bad. To be honest\\, REALLY liked this movie! What I don't think many people realize is that this is a transition movie. It's here to provide a segway from TFA to the next movie. I understand that Luke was disappointing\\, and that the canto-blight sequence pointless\\, but that was only part of the movie. Besides that\\, the effects were great and it had all of the action you would expect in a Star Wars movie. All and all\\, i liked it! you don't need to agree with me on that\\, but remember one thing. At least it's better than the prequels.","true":true}
