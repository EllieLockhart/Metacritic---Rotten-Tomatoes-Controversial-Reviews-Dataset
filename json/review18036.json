Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think this is a great Star Wars movie. It combines the old story spirit and new characters. Don't blind your mind just because it doesn't make sense in your way. Come on\\, we are not in 1979. Star wars need new blood and changes. I love this movie anyway.","true":true}
