The two main characters have different gameplay\\, upgrades and stuff\\, which contributes to deliver a better game.\r\rThe best of the industry in what animations respect. The faces animation are amazing\\, looks really close to real world.\r\rGraphically is awesome\\, uses all the potential of the PS4 and the environments are beautiful.\r\rThe AI is really good\\, it has little to none problems. The human NPC's haves strategies to attack you. The variety of enemies is appreciable and is much more superior than the first game.\r\rDina's character is memorable\\, fits perfect with Ellie. One of ND's successes.\r\rBad things:\r\rAll the new characters except Dina feels kind of empty. The character development is the antithesis of the first game\\, they're all easy to forget and you will not care about them.\r\rThe timeline is a mess. It is not a lineal story\\, you are constantly having flashbacks inside other flashbacks which takes away all the emotion.\r\rThe worst thing is that the game is constantly trying to confront the player\\, to confuse him and to make him feel guilty about the actions done or the actions you are going to do.\r\rIt has a lot of ultra violent scenes that are worthy of a madman.\r\rThe cordycepts infection is anecdotic. It has none effect in the story which is a wasted potential. Remembers me to Negan saga in TWD.\r\rAll Abby's story is a big mistake. The game shouldn't force you to play and care about her. However\\, after some hours I was able to understand her point\\, but Abby has nothing to do with what you loved from the first game and in the way she is presented to the player there is no chance to love the character. Only with two or three cinematics is enough to understand her point and if ND wanted to dive into her story\\, that should be a DLC not part of the main story.\r\rConclusions:\r\rThe game is amazing in all aspects except the narrative\\, which is the most important thing in a game like this. It was seven large years waiting for this release\\, watching all new trailers and with very high expectations. I'm not disappointed at all but definitely the story was far away from what the fans expected. We don't ask for happy endings we just want you to be respectful with the essence of the first game and with the fans that payed and waited so long for this. They kept Abby hidden before game release because they knew no one would like her. Their forced inclusion sounds like some director's whim. This is not a game for everyone\\, anyway it is a must play if you own a PS4 and you liked Part I.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
