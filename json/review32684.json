Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars the Last Jedi meets and exeeds the impossibly high standards set for it. With complex character development\\, a fast momentum built through a string of tense fight scenes and Star Wars typical plot twists\\, The Last Jedi is arguably one of the best films in the franchise. Despite this\\, the film lags around the halfway point following a side plot involving Finn\\, which breaks an otherwise well paced film. We also see alot more emotional depth in Kylo's character than Rae's\\, who in many ways\\, has taken steps back as a well built protaganist since the last film.","true":true}
