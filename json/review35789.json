Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"The Last Jedi\\\" is in the title screen of episode 7. It Cleary says \\\"Luke\\\". Mike Zero or whoever is stupid. Luke is the last Jedi and this is going to be awesome. Watch episode 7 again and in the scrolling it reads \\\"Luke Skywalker\\, the last jedi.\\\" Thank goodness people still read.","true":true}
