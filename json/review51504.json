Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A complete dissapointment as the film shamelessly focuses on creating a 'new generation' of star wars fans (and merch shoppers)\\, exploiting the cast and fans of the original trilogy to do so. The film feels inconsistent throughout with many sub plots being utilised only to flesh out new characters or create 'cool' moments. The story telling and scripting is so dumbed down and rushed with a bucketload of terrible one-liners and attempted jokes that it feels like Disney were attempting to do a Marvel-like hero film. People new to the Star Wars universe may enjoy it\\, but those of us looking to see the story of Luke\\, Leia and Chewie play out in a continuation of the universe\\, and not a Marvel\/DC comic book style reboot\\, can only be hugely dissapointed. The sadest part is that it can not be undone.","true":true}
