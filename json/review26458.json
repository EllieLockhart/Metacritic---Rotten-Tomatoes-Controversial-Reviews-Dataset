Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Now THIS is the Star Wars film I've always wanted to see:  My childhood heroes going against every piece of characterization and growth from the original three movies\\, a pointless B-plot that feels like it lasts 45 minutes\\, and characters who could solve every problem if they just talked to one-another.\\n\\nGood job letting Rian Johnson have free reign on this\\, Disney.  Glad you care so much about your billion dollar darling.","true":true}
