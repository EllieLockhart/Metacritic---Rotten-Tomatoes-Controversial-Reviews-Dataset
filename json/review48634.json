Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"WORST EPISODE\\, EVER!\\\" It makes the prequels look good. As a long time Star Wars fan...it's just painful to watch. So many gaping plot holes you could drive a truck through! Simple changes they could have made would have made the movie decent. It threw away everything The Force Awakens sets up..Disney totally missed the mark. However we all know just because it makes a lot of money doesn't make it quality! Star Wars should be ranked in sequence of how they were made. The original trilogy was the best\\, followed by the prequels\\, the animated series\\, the Force Awakens\\, Rouge One and now that bottom of the barrel...The Last Jedi. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!","true":true}
