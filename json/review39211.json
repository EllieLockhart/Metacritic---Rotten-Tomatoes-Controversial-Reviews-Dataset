Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film created many issues for the future of Star Wars. The writer didn't take their responsibility for the film legacy seriously and if this stays in cannon\\, it tarnishes Star Wars making it just another franchise where each movie is independent of one another.","true":true}
