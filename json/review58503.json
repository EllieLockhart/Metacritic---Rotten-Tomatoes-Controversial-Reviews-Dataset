Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"All i have to say is that if youre giving a bad rating for the game\\, then go play animal crossing or generic happy endings.

Now for my review\\, all i can say about TLOUP2 is that it is the most incredible game ever made in video game history\\, it is absolutely perfect and enhanced from the sequel in every aspect. Graphics are beyond me and really takes the ps4 to its maximum with so much attention to detail and worlds are so beautiful and lush\\, enemy animation is also got a major upgrade especially the infected! the infected not only look better but their animations are better as well\\, im also loving the new enemy human types as well. Gameplay wise is also improved\\, and even the upgrade mechanics. Overall by game being a game it does well\\, and now for the story\\, those hating the story should go play games with happy endings\\, because this game aint like your ordinary game\\, it does end perfectly well that i cried from how epic and emotional it was\\, but some might not like it and just like Neil Druckman said that its something that they would have to live with but indeed it is perfect and definitely shows the world of TLOU in its purest! I loved the story as well as gameplay and level design\\, the new character Abby i also adored so damn much\\, she is very epic and i really got connected with her that by the end of the game i was speechless and she takes a big part in the games universe. In the end im trying to keep this review as spoiler free as possible and i highly recommend this game with a 10\/10 and it really takes the cake of being one of my favorite game of all time and it is on my top 5 personal list of all time! I cant wait to see with what naughty dog brings next to the table. Disclaimer; all those negative reviews dont know what they are talking about and are just doing the negative scores because they dont have anything better to do besides creating negative bots\\, and only playing for less than 3 hours\\, so do yourself a favor and listen to people that actually finished the game\\, mainly reviews with scores of 7-10.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
