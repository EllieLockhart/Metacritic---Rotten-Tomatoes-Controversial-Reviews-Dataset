Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw the new Star Wars for the first time tonight in Calgary. I now understand why much of the Star Wars community is split and up in arms over this movie. It's kind of moronic. The big bad guy is a moron easily defeated\\, and Kylo Ren has zero believability as the new super baddie. General Upchucks is a complete idiot. These bad guys are just weak and formulaic. I especially did not like the cinematography\\, perhaps the ugliest Star Wars yet. After the truly excellent Rouge One this is a major disappointment. Afraid I have to side with half of the community that hates this edition and thinks a major mistake has been made. Most surprising that someone could screw it up even more than Abrams. Star Wars for the Short Attention Span Theatre Crowd. The Leia in the vacuum of space scene is particularly moronic and completely off base with the powers of the force. Luke dies because he \\\"thinks\\\" too hard but Leia survives being in the vacuum of space - clearly this is pathetically bad writing. Fire this director now.","true":true}
