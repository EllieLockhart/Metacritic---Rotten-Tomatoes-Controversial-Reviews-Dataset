Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw it\\, worse than TFA and Rogue One. Oh boy..... Luke made like an asshole\\, Supreme leader made as comical relief\\, all that was missing was  Vin Diesel for \\\"One last ride\\\"....","true":true}
