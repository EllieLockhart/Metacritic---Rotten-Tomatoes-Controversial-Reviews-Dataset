The gameplay\\, while very similar to the first game\\, had some minor improvements but nothing ground breaking. My huge issue with this game is the story and the characters. This didn't feel like a sequel to The Last of Us at all. I really do believe this would have been better as a stand-alone\/spin-off game\\, with different characters to the first\\, but even then it would be a boring game with huge pacing issues. The pacing of this game is terrible. The order of events is baffling. Some parts felt rushed\\, others felt so dragged out I found myself extremely bored. For a story driven game\\, I simply can't give this a score higher than 3 because the writing is lazy\\, sloppy and cringe-worthy. I'm a huge fan of the first game\\, so I really wanted to like this sequel\\, I even got the collectors edition expecting to love it as much as I did the first. It didn't even take me an hour of playing the game to realise it was mediocre compared to the first game (which in my opinion is a masterpiece). I hoped it would get better but it just got worse and worse. Finishing the game felt like a chore\\, it dragged on and on with no real goal in sight. The ending was awful\\, one of the worst endings I've ever seen in a game\\, movie or TV show. I feel like the writer had a mediocre story he wanted to tell\\, without any care or respect for the fans of the first game\\, fans that waited 7 long years for this sequel\\, hoping for something better. I do feel like I wasted my time and money on this game\\, and I honestly don't think I'll be purchasing another game from Naughty Dog. The Last of Us was Naughty Dog's one hit wonder\\, which is a shame because it had such high potential\\, but ultimately ended up being like a long drawn-out episode of The Walking Dead\\, which btw I'm pretty certain The Walking Dead (TV show) is where the writers of this game plucked some of their bad ideas from. This game is the biggest disappointment gaming has ever experienced. 3\/10\u2026 Expand","true":true}
