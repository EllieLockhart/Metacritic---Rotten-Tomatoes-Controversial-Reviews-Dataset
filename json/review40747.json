Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This might be my favorite Star Wars movie\\, and yes\\, that includes Empire. There are a few flaws (something about the pacing of the Poe\/Rose plotline didn't seem great\\, and Phasma was even more disappointing than Boba Fett)\\, but on the whole it's a beautiful film. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley have an amazing chemistry that I can't wait to see again in Episode IX. I had my share of fan theories\\, but the big ones didn't pan out. And I think that's a GOOD thing! A big part of this movie is leaving the past behind\\, which is a bitter pill to swallow for some fans (as you can see from the 53% user rating as of this writing). I love the old Star Wars films\\, and this is a wonderful\\, bittersweet farewell to the original trilogy. Thank you\\, Rian Johnson! Now I just need to go see it a third time...","true":true}
