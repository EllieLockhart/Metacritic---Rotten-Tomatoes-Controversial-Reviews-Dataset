Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Here\u2019s the thing with Star Wars movies\\, they inspire fanboys to show off how much of a Star Wars geek they are by allowing them to show everyone how much better they are at knowing what the story \u201cshould\u201d be about than the filmmakers. You cannot trust their reviews\\, they aren\u2019t talking at all about the actual film\\, only their disappointment in not being right in their predictions. That said\\, I loved it. Did it go the way I thought it would? No\\, but guess what\\, that\u2019s called a twist and is what keeps you guessing. It was long\\, but you also have to consider that Carrie Fisher died shortly after her performance was filmed. They likely kept footage that may have otherwise made it to the cutting room floor to save time to give us just a few more moments with her. I can\u2019t help but respect that. They played with the recurrent themes of the Star Wars trilogies but baiting and switching throughout the film nods to Empire Strikes Back and then throwing it sideways just when your mind begins to settle in and form expectations. The quality of Mark Hammil\u2019s performance cannot be overstated. This was absolutely his finest performance and could be appreciated simply for his amazing\\, completely convincing job back in the role of Like Skywalker. Do yourself a favor\\, see the film\\, it was - in my somewhat worthless opinion - one of the best Star Wars films yet. ","true":true}
