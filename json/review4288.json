Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Byron\\, that was pretty funny\\, \\\"I hate the fucking thing.\\\"  I read the article (Mark Hamill) and realized I should disclose a more fundamental issue with my review.  I always kind of brainlessly assumed I had similar feelings about (and automatically grouped) Star Trek\\, Star Wars\\, Alien\\, etc.  It's all about space\\, right?  Now\\, the differences are glaringly obvious.  I was fascinated by the first Star Wars\\, partly because it was all new\\, and the technology was fantastic.  I thought about it as a fairly tale\\, signaled by the 'once-upon-a-time\\\" trope of \\\"long-ago-in-a-galaxy...\\\"   But that means\\, to me\\, that the whole thing is built on sand\\, and owes nothing at all to reality.  It is both a money-grab (light sabers anyone? wookies? r2d2 under the X-mas tree?) and a religion-grab (Manichean world view\\, Zoroastrianism) all built on nothing\\, plus a giant pile of pomposity.  It doesn't do any of the heavy lifting of Star Trek\\, especially Next Generation\\, Voyager\\, Deep Space 9\\, which builds worlds\\, cultures\\, and never\\, in my memory\\, doesn't explain the motivations of even evil characters in a way that makes them complex\\, not just brainlessly\\, simplistically evil.  It's also built on a worked out prognosis for the Earth and history -- what pain and destruction the Earth went through to finally get to a place where there is no dominant religion\\, men and women and races are equal\\, poverty is wiped out\\, and then goes on from there to consider other cultures 'out there' which have take different turns\\, and contemplates them. It also goes on to take on the issue of AI and the rights of androids\\, i.e.\\, what makes us human.  So when I contrast that to the ugly little Yoda spouting cliches\\, and to those dumb color-coded light swords\\, it all looks like ridiculous\\, lightweight fluff that isn't even entertaining because it's trying so hard to be meaningful when it's all nonsense.  Actually\\, in some of the scenes\\, I thought about Indiana Jones in the market place when the guy is swinging around a giant sword\\, preparing for battle with IJ and his big whip\\, and IJ takes out a gun and shoots him.  To me it's like a gigantic multi-level ice cream cone with a bunch of melting balls toppling over\\, stuffed into a mushy cone at the bottom (the first movie) ripping at the seams.  I think the only way I could respect it is if it turned around and spoofed itself\\, the way Mel Brooks spoofed it in Space Balls.  Without that\\, it is a giant\\, pompous gaseous belch into space\\, expanding all the way to that galaxy\\, far\\, far away!","true":true}
