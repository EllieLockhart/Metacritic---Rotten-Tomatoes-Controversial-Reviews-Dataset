Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was garbage.  It was a complete betrayal to the characters and fans.  The pacing was messed up.  All of the scenes fell short in excitement and exposition.  Shame on Disney for allowing this movie to be released.","true":true}
