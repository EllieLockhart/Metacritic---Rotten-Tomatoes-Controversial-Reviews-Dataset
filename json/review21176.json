{"101487":147072,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2019-12-20","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was very excited to see this movie continue the exploration of the new characters that were set up marvelously by The Force Awakens\\, but I found myself sorely disappointed. Rian Johnson actually tried to make a good movie\\, he wrote a pretty good script that clearly laid out his own vision for a Star Wars film\\, but it just so happens that his vision almost completely contradicted everything that the Force Awakens set up\\, leaving me very disappointed and kind of confused. Johnson clearly had a script already set up for a Star Wars movie\\, and it was his own original story\\, and he didn't hate the last movie\\, so it makes no sense as to why he directed a film in this Skywalker Saga\\, he could've done something like Rogue One or Solo instead where his new storyline and subplots wouldn't have mattered as much. I liked Rey's past being ambiguous\\, I liked Finn choosing for himself who he wants to really be\\, and I loved the conflict that Kylo Ren felt within himself\\, but that all kind of doesn't matter anymore\\, even Luke's surprise cameo at the end felt like it was changed from the original idea. I loved seeing Mark Hamill back\\, giving possibly the greatest performance of his career\\, his character just didn't feel like Luke anymore\\, they changed him too much. Adam Driver was amazing\\, Kylo Ren is still the best new character and we get several flashbacks containing information of his past and I loved seeing it three different times\\, each time getting more and more filled\\, it so good\\, I also really liked him without a mask\\, we can actually see his emotions and it is heartbreaking to see him continue down the path of darkness\\, I was so emotionally attached to him\\, he is a great character. I also loved the \\\"Reylo\\\" connection that is built throughout this film\\, it makes both of their characters' emotions more impactful\\, and the force visions or whatever they are called where they can see and have a conversation with each other from two different areas is some really good stuff\\, it could be used to greater effect in another movie and I think that we should see more of it. Carrie Fisher wasn't great here\\, she is just too old to be doing this anymore\\, I didn't think that she really had a place in this movie. Oscar Isaac is also back\\, but he doesn't do anything at all\\, his great character with potential is wasted and feels very lifeless. Daisy Ridley is still not great to me as a Star Wars character\\, she is too childlike and assertive for my liking\\, I did like seeing her pull to the dark side though. Domnahall Gleeson is once again brilliant here\\, he gives a very commanding performance that makes him mentally threatening\\, though his screaming yelling can get somewhat irritating at times. Snoke was a complete throwaway\\, they didn't explain anything about him at all and they just killed him\\, I was so frustrated by that. The character of Rose Tico annoyed the hell out of me\\, she is just a whiny little brat who wants everybody to be her friend\\, she really pissed me off with creating a love triangle between her\\, Finn\\, and Rey\\, I hate the idea of her and Finn being together. Benicio Del Toro also had a terrible character\\, he just made me mad every time he was on screen and his whole character is just a very convenient plot point to \\\"help out\\\" the resistance\\, and I hated it\\, he had no real substance and that will never work for any character. The entire subplot of Finn and Rose going to a casino to find a master codebreaker is so long and boring and I hate Rose so much\\, it makes the movie drag way to much\\, and it turns out that they did all of it for nothing so you can be perfectly fine with skipping that whole half an hour of monotony. Captain Phasma was talked up about having a bigger role in this film but she had a smaller role and\\, she presumably dies so her really cool female character was completely wasted after she had a good set up in the last movie. This movie makes so many turns in the path that J.J. Abrams laid out for this trilogy\\, Johnson basically said: \\\"I know this is a sequel\\, but we're making it my way\\\". This is a movie that tells you the answers to the questions in the Force Awakens don't matter at all\\, and it asks its own questions as well\\, it felt like a reboot that was highly unnecessary. I feel like I hate this movie\\, but it was well made with a decently written script\\, pretty good action sequences\\, great development for Kylo Ren and the visual effects are second to none\\, but narratively\\, it made choices that were just wrong on so many levels of Star Wars fandom and mythology\\, this movie would've been better if it was part of its own series. The story betrays the old characters\\, especially Luke\\, and also what was set up for the new characters\\, I feel very conflicted about this film\\, at least it feels like a Star Wars movie and it tries to tell a compelling story\\, and there are so many plot twists that make this story feel unique and different than the other films\\, but most of them feel completely out of left field and unnecessary\\, this movie had the potential of tightening already planted storylines\\, but instead tried too hard to be different and risky\\, and while I admire risky filmmaking\\, it just didn't always work for me here. The craft on display here is very good\\, but it could've been better than it was\\, Rian Johnson made a good movie\\, but it is not a great Star Wars movie.","true":true}
