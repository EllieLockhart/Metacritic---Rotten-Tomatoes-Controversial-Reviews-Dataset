Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poorly paced\\, some poor dialog\\, to much comedy in places that should have been serious and tense\\, and a whole plot line that could have been avoided if Vice Admiral Holdo had simply told Poe Dameron the plan in stead of denegrading him. The time wasted on the Casino scenes could have been used for better story or character development. Supreme Leader Snoke was a wasted character and the depiction of Luke's character is extremely disappointing. There was also wasted postential with the dynamic between Rey and Kylo. Aside from the major issues\\, there were many other smaller issues like bombs dropping in space (no gravity for bombs to fall) or the strange love triangle that seems to have been introduced between Rose\\, Fin and Rey. The good side to the film was the visual effects but that doesn't make up for the poorly written story. I was very disappointed and upset with this movie.","true":true}
