Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No spoilers.\\n\\nAnother exciting romp through that galaxy far far away.   Full of your typical fantastic Star Wars action scenes and a story that is not what you are expecting!   You will be left very much looking forward to the final installment of this sequel trilogy.   \\n\\nThe interplay between the new generation and the old is spot on\\, and despite the nay sayers\\, if you have an open mind about what is\\, what was\\, and what is yet to be\\,  you WILL enjoy this movie.   However if you're a stick in the mud who demands the story live up to your every expectation of what is supposed to be\\,  then this movie\\, and what Star Wars has always been from the beginning (despite what you thought you knew through a child's eyes) \\, is not for you.\\n\\nOtherwise\\, go in\\, have a great adventure\\, and enjoy yourself!","true":true}
