Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you took the Star Wars franchising off of this film\\, it is probably a decent film. Considering it's suppose to be canon material in said franchise\\, it does a complete disservice to the characters and world building that took place prior. \\n\\nI've revisited this movie multiple times before writing this review because I wanted to believe it would bring purpose in the final film. \\n\\nAfter seeing the complete saga\\, it's clear this was a directorial misstep. I don't blame Rian Johnson. I blame Disney for putting such a heavily sized project on a director that didn't have the history to validate him on this project. \\n\\nOverall\\, the tone and use of characters was poor and the world building even worse. The final nail in the coffin was the plot that didn't grow customers over its run time. By the end of the movie almost all characters are emotional and physically in the same place they were in the beginning of the film.","true":true}
