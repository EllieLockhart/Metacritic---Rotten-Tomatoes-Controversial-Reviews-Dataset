Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is\\, and by far\\, the worst Star Wars movie EVER made ! Poor caracter devellopment\\, bad story telling\\, SJW B.S. shoved down our mouths in the most simplistic idiotic ways. Complete destruction and disrespect of teh most beloved persona in this movie franchise: Luke Skywalker. The Canto Bite arc who takes forever and amounts to no pay off what so ever. And i could go on and on about Rey and Finn being caracters nobody identifies and CONGRATULATIONS for creating Rose Tico\\, the most insignificant Star Wars caracter since Jar Jar Binks. I will not go to Solo\\, i encourage you to Boycott Star Wars. Goodbye.","true":true}
