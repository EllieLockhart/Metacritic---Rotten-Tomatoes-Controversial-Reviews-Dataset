Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"rian Johnson is an utter disgrace and has done something I thought unthinkable make the worst star wars movie in the entire franchise. Whats worse is that not only did he make a horrible movie he actually destroyed every single movie and show in all of star wars. (spoilers) by 1 opening scene horrible physics where apparently space battles are fought like in ww2 and shps being able to ram in light speed. literally makes every even in every movie broken. Not to mention how he shit on everything foreshadowed in awakens and essentially made them two non coherent films ... the fact critics are over 90 on this shows how bought and paid for these morons are. This is a disgusting disappointment. the entire film needs to be re edited by jj abrams and any re shoots should be paid for by rian johnson.... who created lazy horrible plot points and characters.. . ]","true":true}
