It beats you in concussive jolts you don't wish to strike\\, the alternative choices you desperately want these people to make\\, and through the entirety of the journeys of 2 characters who are\\, in the end\\, 2 sides of the same coin. Both look into the darkness\\, but one is hoping to find the light of grace that was taken from her\\, and the other wishes to find it in the eternal shadows that would have given her existence meaning and sense. Both mock religious martyrs\\, but that is exactly what they become...except both are martyrs to a congregation of one in their own empty temples. The other characters\\, in fact\\, the whole word preaches to them\\, but they are like Trojan soldiers when Cassandra spoke. They hear\\, and ignore\\, the prophet's dire warnings of war without end\\, and victory at all cost...and cost it must...especially when all one hears from the plaintive\\, well-spoken advice of street wise prophets is babbles and baubles. Hence\\, why all logic is spoken from a theatre with a marquee bearing the name \\\"Cassandra.\\\"This isn't a game one \\\"plays\\\". You don't \\\"control\\\" these people. You're along for the ride with the same knowledge of an audience that watches a Greek tragedy. It's an immersive dive into a virtual experience of dramatic irony played out as an epic elegy and a dirge. It speaks with somber poetic prose and sings out a mournful lamentation in its soundtrack\\, dialogue\\, and the pulpy violent narrative that knit it all together into one experience. This game is like the bifurcated tale of the Greeks after the fall of Troy\\, 2 parts of one of humanity's grand armies searching for a home\\, or an idea of it\\, that no longer exists. One makes it to home's warm embrace. One is perpetually searching. They both ache for what the other has...but have no idea what to do with their own mad kingdoms when they are the last ones standing.In the end...all the kingdoms fall when the furies rage on and on and on for revenge amidst the rubble. Eventually\\, all that rage and rubble is pulverized to dust...and blows away\\, carried on the wind of forgotten songs captured in music beaten mercilessly into stone for the ages\\, but left no mercy for the memory of how the songs were played and sung. The song fades into its own drowning wind\\, letting go of the nostalgia of what was\\, and leaving the hollow\\, hopeful ache of what might be. I have no idea how a goddamn video game made me think and feel so much\\, but the artistry of it all is not meant to be understood\\, but experienced.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
