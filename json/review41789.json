Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is really bad. Takes no character to nowhere\\, The movies is about breaking expectations\\, Yes it is new and bold\\, but this movie didn't delivers nothing. Entire sequences are created\\, raise expectations and end in nothing. I'm not a hardcore fan that is offended by the total disrespect for decades of lore\\, but I'm am disapointed because this movie is not a Star Wars movie that is bad\\, it is a bad movie plain and simple. Nothing makes sense\\, Lots of side quests that end in nothing. Terrible movie.","true":true}
