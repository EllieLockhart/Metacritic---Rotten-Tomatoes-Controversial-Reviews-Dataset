Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"***REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*** I've seen it twice now and the second time around the universe I noticed some serious plot holes that upon reflection are very disappointing.   I'm not sure how they're going to fix these issues in 9 or if it's even possible.  The movie is beautiful no doubt but there are several parts of the film where you're like what?  Okay so all ships have the same MAX speed when not traveling at light speed?  Little ships can travel faster the big ships?  I don't get it.  They can track in hyper space now?  What? You can light speed through big ships and distroy them? That's cool.  Why did they just think of this?  Why did the let all the ships get destroyed by gun fire if they are able to light speed into ships?  Kind of weird.","true":true}
