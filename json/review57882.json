Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a disgrace to star wars fans.  A disgrace to treasured characters.  Mark Hamill being upset with the direction of this movie should have been enough for them to change their ideas.  The story had too many flaws.  Too many characters had no development.  No backstory.  No explainations for major story points that needed explaining.  Horrible direction for where they are taking this saga\\, and these characters.  Who in their right mind would approve this script?  My best guess is probably someone who doesn't appreciate star wars like many beloved fans do.  The force awakens had its flaws\\, but the last jedi was an opportunity to pave the way for understanding\\, and great story telling.  It was an epic failure of great proportions.   I do not wish to see episode 9 now.  I probably will\\, but i just may wait for a good copy of it to be downloaded on bootleg.  Im not gonna waste more money on being disappointed again.   I honestly feel terrible for JJ Abrams and what Rian Johnson left him with as far as characters to work with.  No snoke?  No Phasma?  A first order with no explaination as to how they have so much resources.  What do we get?  A force ghost luke skywalker?  Such a missed opportunity to show us the Luke we all wished and hoped for.  In star wars its best to listen to the fans.  Read the forums.  Watch the youtube videos.  Learn the things about star wars that fans want to see.","true":true}
