Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So first Star Wars fans are pissed cause Force Awakens was too similar to the original\\, but now they\u2019re pissed cause Last Jedi was so different? If all you do is complain and cling to the original trilogy\\, why do you even bother going to the movie? I am a humongous Star Wars fan\\, and I loved TFA and TLJ. Bravo\\, Rian Johnson! I\u2019m going to enjoy the fact that Star Wars movies are still being made instead of whining.","true":true}
