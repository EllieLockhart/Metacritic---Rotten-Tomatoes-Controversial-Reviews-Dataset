Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall story was good as well as character development and action but the one thing I did not like was the overuse of comedy.  I felt it was too distracting and at times unnecessary for some scenes. Can't really say too much else without going into spoilers but it is worth the ticket\\, after the crowds die down.","true":true}
