Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I probably will not continue to support this series if the quality and consistency do not improve. At least the prequels did not make me hate any existing characters from the series. Would have been better to leave Luke\/Han\/Leia out if they were going to ruin them. Hopefully Game of thrones (which up to this point has been great) won't have an ending that ruins the entire series longevity.","true":true}
