Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I tried\\, I really really tried to watch this movie all the way through. \\n But no matter what I found myself fast forwarding parts that did not just make me lose interest but wince and cringe. My hand instinctively reached for the remote multiple times.\\n Of the few moments I managed to get through I was left jaw dropped in utter amazement that I could be so utterly disappointed in the script. \\n Truth is\\, I don't think the actors didn't have the chops. The special effects teams seem to do solid work. The costumes and set design crews deserve real praise for getting it right. \\n But how?!\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00a1 How on Earth did that script make it\u00c2\u00bf!\\n Disney\\, are you now tone def? Do you honestly not know what start wars is??? I have a job where I interact with adults and children all the time\\, no one thinks the last Jedi was even watchable. The kids\\, ranging from age 12 to 15\\, state the movie was so easy to forget they don't even know the names of the characters. But they DO still know every Harry Potter characters names\\, books\\, events and more. They can quote hunger games and tell me everything there is to know about Pokemon and fortnight. But not only do they not care about star wars\\, they actually think it is lame now. \\n Congrats Disney\\, you killed the greatest more profitable I.P. in cinema history.","true":true}
