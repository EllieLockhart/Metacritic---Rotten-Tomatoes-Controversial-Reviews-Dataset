Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There's a lot of early fan-hate for this movie out there - ignore it. Is The Last Jedi a perfect film? No. But it's a fantastic addition to the Star Wars Universe\\, lots of fun\\, and absolutely worth seeing. The negativity out there right now is largely an amorphous blob of 'I didn't like the movie because...well I just didn't like it.'. I think this boils down to the fact that the movie is 'not going to go the way you think' - a classic case of expectations not meeting reality. Director Rian Johnson makes some bold and courageous moves with the franchise\\, and if you keep an open mind the movie delivers on its promise to take things in exciting new directions\\, 100%. I've now seen the movie twice\\, and I will say that\\, more than any other movie I've seen previously\\, a second viewing is a must. After the first viewing\\, I really liked the movie - seeing it twice\\, I loved it. There is so much you're going to miss the first time you see it - and things that feel out of place or inconsistent on first viewing make a LOT more sense once you can see how they fit in with the rest of the movie\\, and with the rest of the universe. If I have one gripe\\, it's some disappointment in the quality of SFX and editing. Some of the green screen shots are jarring\\, and one moment of dialogue in particular was edited VERY poorly. Considering this is a Lucasfilm effort\\, I was pretty shocked by this. Those are small issues though. Star Wars movie are\\, and have always been\\, for kids. The Last Jedi embraces that ethos. To desire Star Wars to be dark\\, and gritty\\, and humorless is to desire something other than Star Wars. I\\, for one\\, am excited about where this universe is headed. It's in good hands.","true":true}
