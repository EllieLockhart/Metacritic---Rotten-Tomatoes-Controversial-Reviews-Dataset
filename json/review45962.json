Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually breathtaking but lacking in what has made Star Wars such a beloved franchise; the more I think about it\\, the worse it gets. An incredibly uninspired and disappointing affair.\\nEDIT: I've now had 4 days to think more thoroughly about this movie and it pains me to say this but...Star Wars: The Last Jedi is an abomination.","true":true}
