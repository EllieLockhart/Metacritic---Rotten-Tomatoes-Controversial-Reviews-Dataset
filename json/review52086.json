Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing the audience reviews I was \\\"iffy\\\" about this film. I'd definitely recommend watching before looking at reviews. The biggest flaw of the movie is Luke Skywalker. He did less than all of the characters and he's the polar opposite then when we last seen him in Return of the Jedi. The newer characters are the main focus (which I loved!) and we get more characters\\, yet they seem unimportant... The standouts are (not in any order): Snoke\\, Kylo Ren\\, Rey\\, Finn\\, Poe and Rose.","true":true}
