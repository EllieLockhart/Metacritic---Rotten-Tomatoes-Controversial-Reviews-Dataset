Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am not a professional film critic\\, learned in the arts of cinematography\\, and have never written a movie review before. But\\, after seeing this film\\, I felt compelled to do so. In brief\\, Last Jedi is a steaming pile of shit. Nonsensical\\, jumpy plot\\, painfully awkward attempts at humor\\, a random\\, tacked-on love story\\, and\\, worst of all\\, the utter desecration of beloved characters. For instance\\, the director\\, for some unfathomable reason\\, transformed Luke into a bitter\\, grumpy old man who spends his remaining years brooding and drinking green teat-milk from weird beach creatures. \\\"Super Villain\\\" Snoke is effortlessly killed off by a laser to the midsection\\, with nary an explanation of who he was and how he became Supreme Leader of the First Order. The porgs were cute\\, I guess. That\\, and the first action sequence\\, were the only redeeming aspects of the movie. Avoid.","true":true}
