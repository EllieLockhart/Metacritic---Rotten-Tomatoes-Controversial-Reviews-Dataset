Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am not one to usually post a movie review... but this is a really bad movie! Bad fight scenes which make no sense like slow bombers in this age of star fighters to stupid dialogue to dumb and regurgitated plot lines to senseless dialogue.... uggggh just one insult to the audience after another.  Love Star Wars\\,but this was awful trash.... see it once if you must but it will be waste of time! Disney better get its act together and stop the politics....we just want a good fun movie\\, not a lecture\\,","true":true}
