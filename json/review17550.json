{"101487":139810,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-31","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I signed up to pile on. This movie was bad. So bad in fact\\, that as a pretty big Star Wars fan\\, I'm a bit traumatized. Reading these reviews has been therapeutic. I give it 1 1\/2 stars because it was fairly watchable thanks to the battle scenes\\, but the plot was terrible.\\n\\nJust how many things were bad\\, gosh were to start.\\n\\nA) Luke\\, the guy that bests Vader\\, but lays down his saber in front of the Emperor\\, suddenly gets the urge to kill his own nephew? I can get that he needs to own failing Ben in some way\\, but it had to happen like that? Pure character assassination. \\n\\nB) Snoke\\, one of the most powerful people we've seen with the force and the guy that orchestrates Kylo Ren killing his father\\, the beloved Han Solo\\, is left completely undeveloped. The mystery in his character is just snuffed out.\\n\\nC) Ray's parents. They don't have to be anyone in particular\\, but so much time was dedicated to it (about a movie and half) that it kind of has to be something. Yet Kylo just says they are nobody and that's that. A bit anticlimactic and bad story telling\\, if you ask me. If it was all going to be just some anonymous slave traders the whole time\\, don't make a major plot theme that spans 1.5 movies about it. And that thing in the tunnel where she wants to see her parents\\, but its only her\\, just poorly done all around. It took too much time to be nothing.\\n\\nD) The PC agenda spew.\\n\\ni.  The feminist trope. Poe can be a hot head that f's up and gets dropped down a peg by Leia\\, but we don't need the whole \\\"not what I expected\\\" thing regarding Holdo. He was obviously used to taking orders from powerful women (Leia) and is not Rey's equal\\, so this whole emasculating thing kind comes out of left field and seems overtly forced.\\n\\nii. The war machine profiters on Planet Casino. This is an obvious stab at the \\\"American war machine\\\". It was distracting and not necessary to the story. Again it was forced PC BS.\\n\\niii. The anti-hero theme that culminates with Rose's line about not fighting what we hate but saving what we love. That was stomach turning line not seen since the Anakin\/Padme exchanges.\\n\\nAll of these things just did NOTHING for the plot and little for character development. Poe is a reckless hot head that needs to learn a lesson\\, OK\\, do that in the first 20 minutes and leave the feminist thing out of it. The war machine thing could have been left out entirely. The whole trip to the planet was unnecessary. If we want to develop a bit of a love interest for Finn and humanize him more\\, wrap that into a plot line that contributes to the main story more. Return of the Jedi did this with the 3 parallel battles and Han\/Leia story that develops on the forest moon. That went somewhere\\, they needed to knock out the shield. All of Finn's escapades were failures in plot lines that seemed poorly thought out from the start.","true":true}
