Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There was absolutely nothing redeeming about his movie.  Comic relief was added in all serious moments because Rian Johnson is unable to write a good story and tell it in an engaging way.  Every character that was previous elevated was diminished\\, every bit of suspense from the last film was ground to dust\\, every new subplot was unnecessary and went no where\\, and the main plot involved the bulk of the rebel force doing either nothing or nothing intelligent.  This film seemed like it was written by a focus group in order to give the minimum possible appeal to the greatest possible number of demographics.  The result was an extremely sympathetic First Order - how could the audience not root for them to put an end to this miserable spectacle and restore order to the galaxy?  This film gave the worst of the prequels a run for their money in terms of sheer audience pain.","true":true}
