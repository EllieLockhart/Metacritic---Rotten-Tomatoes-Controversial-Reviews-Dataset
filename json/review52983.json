Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a die hard Star Wars fan I was so excited to see this movie and the new direction they were going for. Turns out the new direction is not a direction at all. Technically well done\\, on second thought this movie is a giant mess. It's dumb\\, uninspired and nothing really important ever happens. But that's not all. Rian Johnson is succeeding in retroactively making Episode 7 bad too by dropping everything interesting and strengthening the aspects that made TFA problematic - like Rey's Mary Sue-ism. He also destroys any spiritual depth the old trilogy had by declaring the Jedi religion redundant\\, but gives us some stupid SJW bullshit instead. I love strong women\\, but the ladies in this movie are making the stupidest decisions possible. Did I mention plot holes? It's actually one giant plot hole\\, although I'm not sure if it can be called a hole if there's no substance around it in the first place. But the worst thing are probably the morals they are trying to force-feed the viewer: Don't eat meat. Treat animals well. Yes\\, that is as deep as it gets in this mess of a movie! Thanks to Disney\\, I'm done with Star Wars.","true":true}
