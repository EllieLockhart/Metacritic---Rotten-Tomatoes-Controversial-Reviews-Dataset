Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"round 3 for this as it keeps Not posting anything.... So the \\\"critics\\\" give this garbage of a movie a 8.1 out of 10 and the people that watch it give it a 2.9.... who do you trust more the people that get Paid to give it a good review or the people that watched it? i have seen this movie and it's crap bad plot holes way WAY WAY to much mery sue crap to make things worth it only good part in the film was when yoda showed up......","true":true}
