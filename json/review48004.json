Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While not a perfect movie\\, and not one that delivered everything I was hoping for\\, it also succeeded in delivering so much more in terms of epic action\\, intimate character development\\, and genuine plot twists that were mostly brilliant about subverting expectations\\, furthering the Star Wars story and keeping me on the edge of my seat for 2.5 hours straight. It's an immeasurably vast improvement over the uninspired and derivative Episode VII. I had a total blast from start to finish\\, and I am genuinely stunned by the hate it's receiving from so many \\\"fans.\\\" This is exactly the movie they should have been craving. Perhaps they should consider another viewing\\, this time free of any expectations they went in with based on two years of carefully cultivated fan theories. They might find it to be a much more enjoyable experience.","true":true}
