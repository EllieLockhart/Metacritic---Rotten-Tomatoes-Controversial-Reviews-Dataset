Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed this movie because it was full of fun\\, action\\, humor and nostalgia. If you love Star Wars you should enjoy this movie. The action keeps coming and while I've read reviews that say that the story isn't moved forward\\, I don't think that's accurate. This movie builds a bridge to future films that feature our new heroes without the legends of old while establishing a new and stronger enemy.  I do look forward to Star Wars movies that expand the universe beyond the core characters and create new legends. Rogue One did a great job of creating those types of characters but then (necessarily) killed them all off. If it is true (spoiler coming) ......... that Rey's parents were \\\"nobodies\\\" - and the scene near the end with the young boy from the stables reinforces that - that anyone can have force abilities\\, the universe of possibilities is finally unlocked. I hope that they start following Marvel's lead and creating tonally different and expansive stories that carry the franchise into the future.  As Kylo Ren said so well \\,\\\"Let the past die. Kill it if you have to.\\\"  I hope Disney has the courage to stretch out from here and build a universe of heroes\\, villains\\, jokers and thiefs. BTW\\, Mark Hamill was terrific.","true":true}
