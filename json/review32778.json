Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi was a huge hype from trailer one and bringing in over $200 Million opening weekend\\, but was it any good? Like any other Star Wars film\\, The Last Jedi was enjoyable to watch especially opening night in a crowded theater. The film had great comedic moments and lots of eye candy\\, but there were times the comedy wasn't needed. In the original trilogy\\, we got a majority of our laughs from both Chewy and Han Solo\\, but in this film\\, there were times that the comedy seemed forced especially in serious moments that should have remained serious. There were quite a few points that made me very upset as a fan and a critic\\, but I will not spoil the film. The introduction of new characters was excellent and they definitely did a good job at making you hate them\\, or love them. However\\, there were points in this movie that I would have done entirely different because once the film ended\\, not only was it not satisfying\\, it felt as though there was nothing for J.J Abrams to work with in the next film. I would not say this was one of the best Star Wars films\\, nor one of the worst\\, but it did rank low on my favorites.","true":true}
