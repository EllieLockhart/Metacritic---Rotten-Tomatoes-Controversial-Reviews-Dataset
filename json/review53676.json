Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For the most part I liked this film. I am a huge Star Wars fan. The action was off the hook. I love seeing more and more space ship battles with X-wings\\, Tie fighters\\, etc. The graphics were amazing. \\\"Most\\\" of the characters were cool. The story was fairly interesting. There were a couple things I didn't love about it. 1) Disney has an political agenda behind most movies they make and you could see the P.C all the way through this one. I have cant stand P.C generally. Leave that with fake news. 2) There were some really dumb corny jokes thrown in from time to time. 3) What happened to the Finn and Rey potential relationship??? I think people liked that a lot. He fell in love with some dumb frumpy no one security guard? 4) Princess Leia has powers all of a sudden?? That was dumb. 5) I was never a fan of the original catina scene\\, they seem to add one in every movie and I hate it. Terrible scenes\\, those are never cool Disney. This one centered around rich people making money from sponsoring war on both fronts (political move Disney)\\, not that I disagree that its shameful\\, but with the our politically charged world needs a break from more stuff to stir everyone up.  Overall\\, if you love Star Wars you cant miss this\\, but it was far from a perfect movie.","true":true}
