{"101487":156884,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-25","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a particularly terrible film as some would suggest\\, but definitely not a very good one as others suggest either. It's kind of mediocre overall\\, which is really not great for a franchise known for its Epic styled storytelling.\\n\\nIf you want me to get more detailed with a few spoilers in my review\\, then I'll start with the good things first. The movie had great special effects where you couldn't even tell so many of it was fake and I had to see a behind the scenes feature to understand how much of it was actually just shot in one giant warehouse studio. The music by John Williams\\, while not his finest work\\, is still splendid as usual. The fight scene with Rey and Kylo vs The Praetorian Guards was pretty cool. The space battle dogfights were fun to watch. Kylo Ren got more character development to the point where he might be more anti-hero than he is villain. That was about it\\, really.\\n\\nNow\\, let's do what was wrong. It had too many plot holes such as why the Starships couldn't just hyper speed around in front of the resistance. The story moved too slowly and went practically nowhere with certain subplots. At times\\, it felt like they were trying to tell some underlying political message about capitalism being evil for funding war and how animals need to be saved. Their was too much forced humor at times when I thought the mood was supposed to be serious. The characters were dull stereotypes of an old master refusing to practice kungfu anymore (or the force in this case); gifted student\\, who knows everything and ends up teaching the master; maverick from top gun; feminist commander who doesn't tell her officers her plan because she doesn't like them; Asian fangirl; sleezy scoundrel who is totally trustworthy for some reason. I could go on with everything that's wrong with them\\, especially Luke (Jake) Skywalker\\, but then this review would be twice as long and it's all already been said by others. My biggest problem with most of the characters is that they get no real development like they did in the last film and some of them\\, like Finn for example\\, completely ignored their character arcs from the previous Episode. Finally\\, killing off the big bad villain that they were hyping up without even specifying a word about who he was\\, that was a terrible move to make. Now you don't even have main villain set up for your last film in this trilogy. Kylo Ren is supposed to be it now\\, but he certainly doesn't feel like it\\, nor does he command the gravitas to be truly seen as one like Vader\\, Maul\\, and Dooku were. As I said earlier\\, he's a better antihero than villain and can't carry a film on his own as such. General Hux will likely betray him and take over the villain role\\, but this film portrayed him as nothing more than a sniveling rat\\, so he's even less epic.\\n\\nThe whole move overall feels like a Star Wars fan-fiction film\\, but with an enormously high budget. If this is what I can expect from the Episode 9 then I really don't intend to ever see it in theaters again. It was a waste of money really.","true":true}
