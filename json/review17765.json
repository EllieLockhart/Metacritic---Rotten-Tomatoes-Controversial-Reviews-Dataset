Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It does not surprise me that the most renown critics missed the point on this one. Even as a stand alone film\\, it was poor. It took out the crucial elements that all Star Wars have come to love about this universe. I am gobsmacked with how many different arcs and questions they ruined and answered poorly. I'm even more gobsmacked at the positive reviews","true":true}
