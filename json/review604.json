The graphics and visuals are truly stunning\\, immersing you into the game from the very start. Beautifully crafted scenery\\, facial recognition\\, lighting and textures all add to the game and make it feel like you're in a movie.Waiting over a year for this game to be released i had high expectations on a game i felt would ultimately fall short and leave me disappointed.\rBoy was i wrong! The graphics and visuals are truly stunning\\, immersing you into the game from the very start. Beautifully crafted scenery\\, facial recognition\\, lighting and textures all add to the game and make it feel like you're in a movie.\rThe character played by Hayden Panettiere is lifelike\\, the movement\\, the voice\\, the facial expressions. If you were a fan of heroes\\, you'll know what i mean.\rThe game sets on you a path where\\, in honesty you are on rails following the story through to its completion. Every chapter has decisions and events where you choose the destiny of certain characters. This make it immersive and i have fully enjoyed every minute I've spent.\rIts scary\\, jumpy and leaves you wondering when the next twist int he plot will happen. Each 'jump scare' moment it recorded and you can watch back as you literally jump out of your chair.\rOverall the game is amazing\\, id not change anything and also look forward to see if the do a Morpheus edition.\rHighly recommended\u2026 Expand","true":true}
