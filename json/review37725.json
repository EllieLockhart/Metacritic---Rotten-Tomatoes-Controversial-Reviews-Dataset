Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There was a moment in phantom menace where I looked down and just realized that a Star Wars movie sucked. That was when jar jar stepped in da poopy. \\n\\nAttack of the clones had a similar if not worse moment when Anakin talked about sand. \\n\\nThis film has multiple moment and to the prequels credit they never mangled the mythos or important characters. It castrattes and humiliates the very essence of Star Wars. Yes\\, I just said that this movie is worse then the prequels and it is\\, it very much is.","true":true}
