Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horribly Sexist movie that is only pushing for female presence and actively portrays every male character in a negative light to push the concept of \\\"toxic masculinity\\\". There is not a single male role model in this movie for young boys. Every male character is at some point beaten up by a female ally and 'set straight'. Not sure what kind of message that was supposed to send","true":true}
