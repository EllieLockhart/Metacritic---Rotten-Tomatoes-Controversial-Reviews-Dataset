Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's strange to me how this has a audience score so high as i am yet to meet a person who thought it that enjoyable. Its not the first time ive watched a bad Star Wars film\\, but its the first time i felt the saga was unfix-able. Since return of the Jedi fans have waited to see Luke Skywalker with amazing force powers\\, as he was our child hood hero. JJ Abrams robbed us of a Luke Skywalker lightsaber fight\\, so another two years was added to our waiting to see the super-wise\\, super-hard Luke Skywalker.  Not only did we get robbed again\\, but Rian Johnson Killed off the chance of us ever seeing it ever. How can Disney be so far removed from what we want? They ll pay with their pockets cause who wants an episode 9 without a living Skywalker?","true":true}
