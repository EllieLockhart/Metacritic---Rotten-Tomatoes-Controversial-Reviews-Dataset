Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ uses but subverts our expectations of common Star Wars tropes and grows the saga as a whole.  Of the most recent Disney Star Wars iterations it is the most successful in portraying the SW universe with an epic sense of scale\\, both visually and tonally.  It has some pace issues but overall is still structurally one of the tightest films of the saga.  Cinematographically it is possibly one of the most beautifully composed of the franchise.  Fan service is there as expected\\, but it felt much more organic to the context of the story\\, especially compared to the fan service moments from TFA or Rogue One.  In the end Johnson has impressively reconstituted so much of the obligatory prerequisite themes expected from a Star Wars saga film into something that feels fresh and very entertaining\\, yet manages to maintain his unique artistic signature.","true":true}
