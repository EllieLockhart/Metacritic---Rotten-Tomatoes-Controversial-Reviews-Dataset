Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"many plot holes\\, there is no reasonable explanation why luke acted the way he did. It seemed completly out of character if you remember him from Episode VI. \\nIt fell like the film tries too hard to transport political messages\\, for example that women are badass patient warriors\\, eating meat is wrong\\, capitalism is bad\\, men are machos (which is bad of course) and inferior to women and so on.","true":true}
