Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"BY FAR THE BEST STAR WARS MOVIE! Rey and Kulos relationship are further explored and the tension only increases throughout the movie. Rian Johnson does a fantastic job at evoking and changing emotions towards characters like kylo. While bad\\, his amazing work and trickery can make the audience cheer for him and be on his side. The intense\\, often occurring plot twists are unpredictable and INSANE. This is the best star wars movie and one of the best films ever made.","true":true}
