Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This has been my favorite of all the Star Wars movies... I know I'm too young to have fully appreciated the original trilogy but from my perspective\\, this has been the best. Full body chills at a couple different points\\, Rian Johnson did a great job with it.","true":true}
