Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No one hates star wars movies quite like star wars fans. I enjoyed every minute of this movie. The whole thing isn't basically a remake of empire like the force a awakens was for a new hope. I found the whole thing satisfyingly unpredictable and though there were some parts that were a little slow I was never bored.","true":true}
