Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a stand alone sci fi film it was pretty to watch but had a truly weak narrative\\, As a star wars film\\, oh boy\\, a disaster. Added nothing to the roots of the Force Awakens\\, cringey dialogue\\, ruined classic characters\\, poor motivations and the list goes on. Never would I have thought after enjoying rouge one and TFA that this would fall so far from grace\\, leading me to miss the days of Lucas at the helm.","true":true}
