Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This episode close all my relationship that I have with the original trilogy\\, it's a kind of farewell to Star Wars universe that we all know\\, it is painful to see original characters going away\\, but the way the story is told\\, it's unique an fair enough for the multiple generations that we are currently seeing this new wave of movies.","true":true}
