Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked this movie more after it finished and I got to think about it. It didn't quite fit with the Star Wars tropes\\, it thumbed its nose at heroes from royal lineage\\, it had a couple of messages which were actually quite powerful \\\"Failure is our greatest teacher' and 'we win\\, not by fighting what we hate\\, but saving what we love' Those two messages made sense of the whole movie. \\nSome parts were overly emo\\, some I think could be edited to be a bit tighter.\\nAnd some illogical shit was annoying - there's no gravity in space\\, why did the bombs drop down??\\nBut overall\\, once I got over my expectations... I think it's a better movie than expected - 8\/10","true":true}
