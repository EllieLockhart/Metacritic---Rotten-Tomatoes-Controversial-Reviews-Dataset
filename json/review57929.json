Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What can I say. I am utterly disappointed and deflated after watching this. The saga has gone backwards for me. Too much misplaced comedy. The opening scene set the low tone and the film never really picked up from there. After Luke Skywalkers first scene I nearly left the cinema there and then. I am glad I didn't as he was outstanding from there onwards. He was the saviour of the film and the only real reason to watch it. The story progression was non existant. \\n\\nThe similarities to The Empire Strikes Back are unacceptable. I though The Force Awakens was similar to A New Hope but this film takes the biscuit.\\n\\nAny tension that happened to build was quickly snuffed out by a poorly executed joke. Why Disney or Rian Johnson seems to think there needs to be thus much forced comedy in what should be a Sci fi epic is beyond me. If the film didn't have half of the jokes in there it may have been a good watch. It ruined the whole tone of the movie. \\n\\nThis is just my personal opinion of course. But I am a true star wars fan and have been for many many years and I feel saddened by what the franchise has become.","true":true}
