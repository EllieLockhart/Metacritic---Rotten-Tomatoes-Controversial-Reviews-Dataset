Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A lot of action\\, beautiful imagery\\, and lots of things getting blown up! The story\\, on the other hand\\, was similar to taking a mud bath in a sewer! Nothing was answered! The space battle was a joke! And THAT was not our Luke Skywalker! What a disrespectful way to treat the flagship character of Star Wars! It seems like Disney's long term plan is to erase George Lucas from his own creation\\, so when people think Star Wars in the future\\, the only names that come to mind are Rey and Disney. Sorry\\, not my Star Wars! This is nothing more than a cheap reboot imitation! If Rian Johnson (What an appropriate sir name) writes episode nine\\, I will not see it!","true":true}
