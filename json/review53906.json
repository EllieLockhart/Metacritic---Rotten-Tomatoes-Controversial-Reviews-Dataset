Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horribly written. The comedy was often akward and out of place. The plot direction for Luke was disgusting. They completely ruined the man we have always cared the most for....in the most bizare way! The story had weird holes all through it. Adam\\, Daisey and Mark did great jobs with the acting. This abortion of a Star Wars movie is not their fault. This was simply written HORRIBLY. Its amazing how bad this really is now that the pre-movie excitement has gone away. How did this actually pass through the creative minds and get the green at LucasFilm?  Mark Hammil was completely right and history will clearly be on his side every time we think if this movie in the future. It did nothing to advance the storyline....it simply takes everything and stabs it in the back.","true":true}
