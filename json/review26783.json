Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Once again i was disappoibted by disneys atar wars movie. A once great story with a sensitiv canonical storyline became once more the point of interesst of individual political opinions. The last jedi is for me just like a james bond movie\\, portrayed without a white\\, middle-aged\\, charismatic heterosexual englishman\\, but with a indian-british ugly annoying homosexual as Bond. Changing the basic of a storylime doesn't work and i am really sorry once again to have been wasting roughly $30 in a swiss movie theater watching this movie. Never agin\\, no more disney-star wars until they return to the canonical storyline.","true":true}
