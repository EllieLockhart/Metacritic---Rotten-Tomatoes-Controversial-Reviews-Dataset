Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This Last Jedi is unlike any other Star Wars movie I've ever seen. Uneven pacing\\, jokes every 10 minutes and the entire Finn and Rose story just felt misplaced. It seems that I didn't like the movie but it's completely the opposite. What Ryan Johnson did deliver was some of the BEST Star Wars moments ever in my opinion. Beautifully shot\\, wonderfully acted by the entire cast but Adam Driver and Mark Hamill were amazing. Again the movie does have issues but the risks Ryan Johnson did in this movie made for some of the best moments in franchise history. If you didn't like this movie I understand\\, however if you are a huge Star Wars fan as I am watch it a second time. Hopefully your opinion will change as the good definitely outweigh the bad and changed me from giving it a 4 to a 5\/5. Star Wars needs to take chances and I believe this would be looked back to be one of the best.","true":true}
