They took everything that made the first one a masterpiece and just threw it in the trashcan. This is a failure in storytelling a disrespectful to the OG one and to us the players. Nothing makes sense. The whole game just tries to introduce us to a new character without giving it any dimension while the game tries super hard to just trash Elie for no reason. If at least they tried to give Abby dimension\\, character development instead of just making her a zebra savior and dog person. I can't believe they managed to ruin this game. I was defending the game until half when I saw that instead of choosing the path of good writing they chose the path of trying to manipulate the players. This is one of the most poorly written game I have ever played and the biggest game disappointment ever. I'm mad I threw my money away for that crappy game. I will never buy an ND game ever again. What they did is just so disrespectful to all the players who waited sooo long for this second part to happen. It's just a big slap in the face.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
