Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Anyone who understands the underlying premise of what it means to master the Force\\, will realize that Luke Skywalker (a Jedi Master) should not be portrayed as a petulant\\, Goth tween. I can put up with the unnecessary plot twists\\, the quick dismissal of certain pivotal characters\\, etc.\\, but Luke plays a central role in the development of this movie. Thus\\, his portrayal (which was roundly criticized by the actor himself) ruins what would otherwise have been the capstone of the Star Wars franchise.","true":true}
