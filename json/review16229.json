Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not a big star wars fan but I went to the star wars episode 8 movie and I can sum up the whole movie for you...you enter having good expectations for the movie and meet some new characters that aren't important at all to the movie including Porgs\\, which are just another way to make money\\, most of the Jedi die and they all run away the entire movie...THE END!! ( and many more problems!!)","true":true}
