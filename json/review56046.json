Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointing < shakes head >\\, sure it's flashy\\, and has a semblance of a Star Wars movie < my 11 year old liked the action >.  It's missing the mark on sooo many key story-lines\\, someone wanted to boldly take the series to a new group of fans\\, leaving the rest of us to rot.  Rian missed the mark where AJ held form.","true":true}
