Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a Star Wars tragic and I wanted so badly to love this movie. It was so beautifully shot and that score omg I felt every single note but unfortunately the movie in it's entirety was disappointing. This is a great Rian Johnson movie. The only problem is that it's just a terrible Star Wars film. I felt like a lot of the characters were done a great disservice. Some of their motivations and arcs that were built in The Force Awakens were completely thrown away by Rian and crew in favor of big beautiful action sequences and sometimes mind bogglingly bad plot holes. Holdo felt like she was plucked from the Hunger Games and placed straight into Star Wars. There are some amazing action sequences in this movie that are often let down by silly dialogue and forced humor. Overall I enjoyed the spectacle but I left disappointed as a Star Wars fan.","true":true}
