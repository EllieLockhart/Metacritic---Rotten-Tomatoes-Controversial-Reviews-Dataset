Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a long term Star Wars fan\\, like many my age. I loved Rogue One\\, feeling this was at last a great Star Wars film from the modern age. I had high hopes for the last Jedi. \\n\\nI could not have been more disappointed. \\n\\nMy dislike of this film have nothing to do with what some are claiming is behind the dislike of this film - anti-men sentiments\\, SJWs (I even had to find it what that meant) - that means nothing to me. \\n\\nIt simply is a poor film full of stupid plot lines\\, poor characters and is very disrespectful of the past Star Wars films. \\n\\nLeia is blasted into space after the bridge of her ship is destroyed? Sad but that's ok. But to have her semi frozen body spark to life in space and somehow force fly back into the ship and be rescued and revived?\\n\\nThe cinematic worlds slowest space chase scene? That goes on forever?\\n\\nThe whole casino planet\/space horse racing scene?\\n\\nI could go on but it depresses and angers me in equal measure. \\n\\nI don't care about strong women characters or bad men. I loved Rey in TFA and Jyn in Rogue One\\, still my favourite ever Star Wars film. My take on the last Jedi is that it is simply a bad film in a Wing Commander kind of way. So bad. So many issues. \\n\\nI clapped heartily at the end of Rogue One. I finally felt Disney had cracked the Star Wars code. \\n\\nI was wrong. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi is simply the worst Star Wars film of all time.","true":true}
