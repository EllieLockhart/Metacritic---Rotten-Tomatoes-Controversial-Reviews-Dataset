It shows the beginnings of the later Legends Kazuma Kiryu and Goro Maijima within a genuine and compelling story. I will praise the developers for the story and the well implemented characters.

It shows the beginnings of the later Legends Kazuma Kiryu and Goro Maijima within a genuine and compelling story. I will praise the developers for the story and the well implemented characters. The main story is about a huge governmental founded construction project in Tokyo where the planing phase is nearly finished when it is discovered that a small piece of estate (The empty lot) is not purchased and the owner is nowhere to be found. This can stop the project so the small piece of estate is worth hundreds of millions if not billions of Yen. Now the struggle for power and money begins as the Yakuza and others want use this opportunity for their gains. All characters are connected somewhere to this or get dragged into and of cause there is a lot more to it than you think. The game starts with the story of Kiryu for 2 chapters\\, then switches to Maijima and later back and forth between them. At first you are puzzled how the stories are connected but with each twist new pieces of the puzzle are connected and unfold an incredible story with a satisfying conclusion. Be warned! There will be sad revelations and victims. Destiny has often a cruel hand. For the characters: Kiryu is the stoic archetype of a hero who has his code of honor and while he will struggle will not fall or falter to do what is right. Goro Maijima is the complete opposite from the other games. This should anger fans but his story arc and development is so believable and natural that no one can complain. Then there are the higher ups in the Dojima family. Each one is in competition against each other. There is Daisuke Kuze while he is the oldest guy is still a formidable adversary and gave one advice that can be used in real live: As long as you can stand up (again) and continue you are not truly beaten\u201d. Then there is Hiroki Awano which is a master of persuation (He will make offers you cant refuse;-). The last of the three lieutenants is Keji Shibusawa\\, he is the man of few words who works behind the scenes and the person you should always be paying attention. The patriarch Sohei Dojima is a schemer and plotter which uses the lever of competition on his lieutenants and stays behind to avoid troubles. He was only a plot device in Yakuza 1 and they gave him a lot of personality here. There is also the friendship \/ brotherly relation between Kiryu and Akira Nishikiyama. This is a welcome backstory addition as it makes the story of Yakuza 1 deeper (Wont spoil). For the others: Tetsu Tachibana is a force to be recognized and with Makoto Miura one of the best additions this game makes to the franchise (Cant spoil). There is also the story of Tsukasa Sagawa who is an interesting character and schemer with lot of connections who is holding Maijimas string. At last there is Jun Oda the right hand of Tachibana. He has made a past mistake that haunts his live. Lets talk about the greatest strength of the Yakuza games: The side activities \/ quest. While the games are probably the smallest open world games they are filled to the brim. You've got a lot of side quest which gave you money items or unlock characters for other mini games. They have arcade games of the Sega classics Outrun\\, Super Hang On\\, Space Harrier and Fantasy Zone. You can play Poker\\, Blackjack\\, Roulette\\, Bowling\\, Pool\\, Darts\\, Shogi\\, Mahjong\\, Koi-Koi and Cho Han (I am probably forgetting some activities). You can bet on Cat Fights (No not animals)\\, participate in Pocket Racing\\, try to get Home-runs at the battering center or play a fishing mini game. There is of cause an Underground fighting arena and a Boss walking on the streets you can fight for insane amounts of money. You lose all your money if you lost except you have the right item then you lose only a big amount. The boss gets stronger after each defeat. Two side activities have their own story arc and an awesome reward for completing (Both are also a good source for money).  There is the real estate business for Kiryu. Where you try to beat the leaders of the districts and their shady businesses. You do this by acquirement and development of real estate objects until you became the top dog in the district which leads to a boss fight. My favorite is the Cabaret Club Management for Maijima. You become the manager of a club and try to compete with the other higher ranked clubs. You recruit\\, train and outfit your team. The mechanics are easy to learn with some depth. The battle system is also really good. You will get 3 styles and eventually unlock an ultimate style. All styles can be upgraded and you can unlock new attacks \/ moves. This gives you a good amount of variety. I want also mention the cameos. Because its the eighties you will met Steven Spielberg\\, Michael Jackson and Vladimir Putin (Last one is not named but I will bet money that's really him). Overall this is a masterpiece I can recomened to evryone.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
