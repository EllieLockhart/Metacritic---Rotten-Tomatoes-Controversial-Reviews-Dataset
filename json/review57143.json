Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst Star Wars film I have ever seen\\, and it pains me to say this after loving all the things the Star Wars universe has given us. Yes I loved the prequels even though most didn't. I bought a collectible cup for this movie but I threw it out in the trash because that's where it belongs along with this film and I don't accept this movie as what Star Wars is. A lot of the essence that made a Star Wars film were lost in this movie. \\n\\nWhat I saw was a bunch of plot holes\\, little to no character development for these new characters\\, disrespect for the older characters\\, and a huge SJW agenda move. Why are all the bad qualities in a human being only reflected on the male characters\\, whereas all the good qualities seem to lie only with their female counterpart in this movie? Rian Johnson\\, Kathleen Kennedy\\, someone at Disney can u answer this please? The Star Wars universe does not need this kind of real world BS and believe me you would probably get an even better film. But I guess you guys at Hollywood have your own quota to fulfill in order to continue making these films.","true":true}
