Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The fans deserved better than this. It is a convoluted mess and the choices made were contrarian just for the sake of being contrary. It is clear hat there was no story planed to answer the questions from the last film and it shows in the bad choices this film made.","true":true}
