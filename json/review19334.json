Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its official.  Disney has hired bots to infiltrate RT and leave positive reviews.   Nearly all 3-5 star reviews are nearly identical in nature.  They mention no details about the film\\, have no personality\\, attack the negative reviews and have next to zero profile.  The ones that do have a profile have 3-4 reviews on random movies\\, but were all done recently.  Disney is desperate to keep the rating score from falling any further that where its at\\, 49%.  Something is truly concerning\\, because this score should be closer to 25% based on the hundreds of pages of 1\/2 and 1 star reviews.  RT is becoming less and less trustworthy\\, the longer this continues.  Another example is how they have the same 4 positive audience reviews from shills featured on the front page\\, yet the audience score is 49%.  If this is not bias\\, please tell me what is.  Something dirty is going on.  I know Disney is capable of skewing public opinion through false advertising and propaganda.  The proof is this train wreck they refer to as Star Wars movie.  But\\, I now suspect that somehow\\, RT is now in bed with Disney.  There should be an investigation into this\\, because the fans smell something rotten coming from Rotten Tomatoes.  In the mean time\\, the true Star Wars fans\\, like myself\\, must band together and shed a light on how badly Disney\/Kathleen Kennedy\/Rian Johnson destroyed the Star Wars universe with one single movie.  I will not get into a review\\, because thousands of others have given their synopsis\\, and they are dead on right.  The movie absolutely butchered the characters\\, the storyline\\, the entire F ing 40 year history of George Lucas' Star Wars.  I'm sure he is sitting back\\, with his head lowered and feeling down about his decision to sell the franchise.  It was a source of creativity and pride for him for at least 40+ years\\, and Disney F'ed it up in 2 hours and 28 min.  I'm sure if he could go back in time and keep a stake in it for creative purposes\\, he would.  Even if it cost him billions.  When something you spent your entire life creating\\, is dismantled and trashed before your eyes\\, no amount of money is worth seeing this happen.  Lucas felt pride in Star Wars.  Look at his ranch in California. Disney would prefer to rename Skywalker ranch to SJW ranch\\, if they could.  For George Lucas' sake\\, and our own\\, we must band together as real Star Wars fans to return the proud franchise to what it was.  While I'm sure Disney will try to spin it by releasing false sales numbers\\, we must do what we can to limit the Blu-ray\\, DVD and download purchases when the film makes it there.  Theater sales are already collapsing\\, especially in China.  Almost no one is going to see it more than once\\, even the die-hards\\, that study the franchise like a science experiment\\, are not returning.  With the box office numbers not being where they expected\\, and home video sales much lower\\, this might send enough of message to Disney\\, that they messed with the wrong franchise.  I heard that toy sales were also significantly lower.  Like I said earlier\\, we must avoid all products\\, or anything labeled Last Jedi\\, like its the plague.  Disney looks at one thing\\, the $$$$.  We need to hit them where it hurts.  If we are successful\\, they will relieve Rian Johnson\/Kathleen Kennedy from doing the new trilogy and promote a return to the \\\"real\\\" Star Wars universe with episode IX.  I would love to see episode IX\\, if this was the case.  In the mean time\\, I will continue my boycott of buying all things Disney and Last Jedi related.  I urge all other ACTUAL Star Wars fans to do the same.","true":true}
