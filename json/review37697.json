Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There's way too much going that doesn't actually matter and builds up to nothing. There are plot holes and long dragged out scenes where not much happens. And there is so many small things that made me mad throughout the film. Like how main character somehow can't die from giant explosions but everyone else can?","true":true}
