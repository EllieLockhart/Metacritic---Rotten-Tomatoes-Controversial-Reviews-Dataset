Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a garbage movie. I'm a big Star Wars fan and this movie has only disappointed me. So much potential wasted. Keep it this way\\, Disney. If you kill the Skywalkers\\, you will end killing Star Wars\\, meaning no more money for you.","true":true}
