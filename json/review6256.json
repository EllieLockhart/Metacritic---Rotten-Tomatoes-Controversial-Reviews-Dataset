Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney is a money making machine. They don't care about the fan base\\, they care only about their money. You can see it on their faces (Kennedy etc.) I bet they will come up with another silly monster in episode 9 so all the kids can go crazy.\\n\\nThis is simply not a Star Wars movie although it says so in the title.","true":true}
