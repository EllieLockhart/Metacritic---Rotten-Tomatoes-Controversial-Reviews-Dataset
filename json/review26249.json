Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not terrible but not great either.  Star Wars has always had plot holes and physics issues but the originals were at least fun despite all of that.  The humor seemed out of place at times and forced.  I feel they did a diservice to Rey and Finn by not giving her more character building moments and struggle and with Finn for basically relegating what started as a great character to comic relief.  The pacing was messy and the whole thing left me feeling rather ambivalent about the future of the series.  Some fun parts and great special effects but overall a wasted opportunity.","true":true}
