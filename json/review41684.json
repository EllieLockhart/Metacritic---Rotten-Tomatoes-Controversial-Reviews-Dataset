Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is mockery and a parody of Star Wars and a spit in the face to true Star Wars fans.  I left the theater angry at what I had seen.  I will not be back to see it again and I wont buy it on Blu-Ray or streaming.  This was like Blazing Saddles Star Wars\\, or Spaceballs or Monty Python.  Sad part is that this had the potential to be best Star Wars movie after \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" set everything up so respectfully....this movie is a total blind-side and the most incoherent movie I have ever seen.","true":true}
