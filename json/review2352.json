Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Attention\\, reviews are full of fanboys and Disney employees!  Story falls apart\\, nothing to hold on\\, there is no lore\\, character development or anything to hold on. Overall movie is below average at best! This is a step back even from the last SW ep 8 movie\\, that was not even top notch as well! Do not go to cinema\\, wait for a release if you are a fan\\, not worth it at all","true":true}
