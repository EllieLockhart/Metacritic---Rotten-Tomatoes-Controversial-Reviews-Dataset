The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Disclaimer: I haven't finished this game and I never intend to do so.\r\rThis game is a disaster\\, and it's apparent from the offset. Reading the critic reviews would have you believe that this is the greatest game ever made\\, I suspect their ratings have more to do with ideology and financial incentive than actual objectivity. The game isn't particularly pretty to look at in context of the budget\\, and while graphics aren't everything this 'game' doesn't have much else to offer. The story devolves from the first game into a petty revenge fantasy\\, I could harp on about this but honestly what's the point? The characters are totally different from the first game\\, there's no consistency. You're lead to believe that Joel will play a large part of things\\, they kill him off within a couple of hours. A man who trusts nobody and is a hardened survivor walks into a room full of thugs and announces himself\\, something he never would have done and simply isn't believable.\r\rThere's a horrific 'love scene' in which we're forced to watch Abby get railed that's more hardcore than some of the things you can find on pornhub. I did not want to see this\\, I don't understand why it was in the game. The fact Sony has censored the likes of anime games yet allowed this is the height of hypocrisy.\r\rThe gameplay? Stale and dated\\, the gameplay in the first game wasn't exactly stellar either but it had the story to carry it. This has nothing\\, it's not worth your time or your money. It's a strange fetish created by the self absorbed narcissist Neil Druckmann.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
