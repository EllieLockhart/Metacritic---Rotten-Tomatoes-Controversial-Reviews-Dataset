Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson & Kathleen Kennedy\\, both should be tarred\\, feathered and banned from anything ever to do with any Star Wars related movies etc... real SW universe fans have already reviewed here and else where enough\\, on how the movie really is a disappointment on every single way humanly possible. \\nSo\\, I'm just going to say this. \\nFirst Star Wars movie\\, I never want to see or hear about again. \\nAND \\nIf I ever go to a Star Wars celebration again\\, I'm sure to bring real rotten tomatoes and pass them around to the crowd\\, to show our real rating of this betrayal of its fans and it's legacy they just killed. \\n\\nI've never felt anger\\, disappointment and wanting to leave during a Star Wars movie in cinema... as a true fan\\, I had to sit through it and it was like torture and the anger just kept growing.. and drove home in shock and disbelief.... fans invest their lives into any movie saga\/franchise\\, and this is how they're repaid for their commitment and loyalty ?! \\n\\nIt was not only a knife to the back of its fans\\, but straight to the face and heart simultaneously while smiling at you and saying\\, fuck you and every single Star Wars fan ever!\\n\\nI don't even want to watch the old movies anymore\\, and I've heard many\\, many others feel the same way....... \\n\\nI do hope that real fans of the series will voice their opinions directly to the brass at Disney and at Rian Johnson\/Kathleen Kennedy.. \\n\\nI have a strong feeling the next Star Wars celebration convention will be quite ugly and not sure how they can win us old and real fans back after this complete shit show..... \\n\\nDon't even want to break down the stupid things in this movie\\, because they came at you full speed and every scene... it would take hours to review it and would just make one even more angry! \\n\\nI hope this movie will fail at the theatres after the fan backlash seems to be growing daily\\, and thank god for that ! \\n\\nRIP Star Wars 1977 - 2017","true":true}
