Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really looked forward to it\\, I wanted to like it.  There were some really awesome scenes and surprises\\, but there were just as many boring\\, pointless and recycled parts.  I walked out disappointed\\, as did my friends.","true":true}
