{"101487":131117,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-02-16","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't normally write reviews\\, but after seeing this movie opening weekend\\, I felt compelled to share my thoughts. Last Jedi was a thoroughly mediocre and disappointing affair. The problem is not any political issue\\, but a fundamental failure of storytelling. \\n\\nMajor plot threads are mostly inconsequential and don't move the story forward (could easily have cut the casino planet\\, Rey flirts with dark side and Kylo but goes back to where she started). The character development is poor\\, as Disney resorted to giving one dimensional characters fetch quests to justify having them in the movie (*cough* Rose & Finn *cough*). I'm all for adding new characters\\, but please make them interesting and give them something to do. You know\\, a story. The humor was out of place (prank phone calls\\, c'mon!) \\n\\nAs many have said\\, the way Luke was handled was abominable (SPOILERS). His character changed 180 degrees from the OT\\, and he spends the whole movie as a bitter\\, whiny old hermit. Even in the last act\\, he only shows up as a \\\"force projection\\\". Why would they not have him come in the flesh and go out with some glory? Seriously\\, what what the point of that? After all the hoopla about finding Luke in TFA\\, he should actually come back and have some impact in the broader universe. \\n\\nThat comes back to my main point: the story telling for this new trilogy is really disjointed. It's very shocking Disney \/ LA had no overarching plan or story for the trilogy and just let the director make stuff up for each episode. Say what you will about George Lucas\\, but he had an over-arching story to tell. Today's Lucas Film lacks any creative leadership\\, and the results are clear in the fan reaction to TLJ. \\n\\nI left the theater saddened by what they did to a beloved franchise and in no way excited for Solo or any other SW film.","true":true}
