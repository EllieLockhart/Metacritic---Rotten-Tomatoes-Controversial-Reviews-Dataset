Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to like this movie\\, but after thinking about it and me and my buddies talking. All I can say is its a movie in a \\\"Star wars\\\" setting. Yes they have dumb things they do in all of them\\, but this movie just comes off as boring. The plot is jumbled around\\, Ray literally gets more powerful as the plot requires her to without any training(don't give me any of that luke was like that\\, really i remember luke getting his hand cut off and the shit kicked out of him till the third movie\\, but whatever)\\, Finn was fucking pointless\\, and that asian girl I cant remember the name of came out of fucking no where.\\n\\nExtra questions\\n- Why could she not tell anyone the plan to leave the ship?\\n- Why does ray become more powerful when kylo trains? Who is darth vader's opposite or yoda or sidius or duku or maul or anyone really.\\n- Snoke sucked\\, I think we can all agree on that one. \\n- kylo's nipples are to tiny\\n- Whole story happens because luke is shit with kids\\n\\nAlso if you want a good female protagonist in a star wars story\\, two good examples are Ahsoka Tano\\, and Sabine Wren. Both are females that are not lifted up by abusive tiny nipple people and actually trained.","true":true}
