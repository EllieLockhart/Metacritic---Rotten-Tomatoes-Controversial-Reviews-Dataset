Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had about an hour too long of Finn and a weak character gallivanting around Monte Carlo\\, but besides that\\, this was an excellent movie.\\n\\nI'd bet money that a solid majority of the people hating this movie are fanboys upset that they didn't see their flashing laser swords or Star Wars tropes re-used for the millionth time.  It's time to let the past die.","true":true}
