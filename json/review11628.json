Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible writing\\, horrible plots and even worse explanations\\, unneeded comedy and few and weak or no details given on plot points that we've been looking for answers for. And I am a huge Star Wars nerd. This is such a shame and disappointing.","true":true}
