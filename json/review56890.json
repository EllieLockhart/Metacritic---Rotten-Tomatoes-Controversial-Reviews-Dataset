Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were a LOT of things wrong with this movie. Let's start with the humor. It was way too Marvel-esque\\, and simply detracted from scenes\\, and squandered dramatic tension too often to be effective. The SJW propagandic themes were over the top\\, and remind the viewer of real world political cultural problems going on today. This causes the viewer to become less immersed in the film\\, and serves only to pander to a diminishing group of Social Justice Warriors who need Fantasy to see their ideology succeed in anything\\, as it fails in everything it attempts in reality. Oh\\, and let's not forget how often the laws of physics are squandered in this film. Bombs FALLING from the ship in the first act? Oh now there's gravity in space? Really? I know this is Star Wars\\, thus the explosions in space have always violated the laws of physics\\, but they have at least loosely followed the laws of physics (the limitations of light speed). The fact that how much fuel they had left played a large part in the plot\\, as fuel was needed in \\\"maintaining their speed\\\" as they drift in space\\, when in reality they should maintain their velocity without any need for fuel speaks volumes for how badly this film was written. \\n\\nDo you want to know how to alienate a core part of your fan base? Depict all white males as evil Nazi-esque First Order soldiers\\, and your Rebel Alliance as only minorities fighting for freedom from oppression led by female Generals. Huh\\, almost like there's a political (identity politics) theme going on here. Americans do not like identity politics; we know it's meant to divide us.","true":true}
