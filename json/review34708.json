Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The critics say that fanatics and devoted fans will love it\\, but they don't. I haven't talked to anybody who didn't think that the characters were not acting like themselves\\, the humor was out of place (should have kept his shirt on) and the \\\"epic\\\" scenes were goofy (Superman Leia\\, Virtual Luke) It never felt like a Star Wars movie and I have no idea what the critics saw in this. I don't think Rian Johnson has ever heard of Star Wars and he left a mess to clean up.","true":true}
