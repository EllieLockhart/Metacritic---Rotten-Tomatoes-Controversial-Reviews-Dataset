Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie was a complete disgrace to Star Wars\\, every plot point in Episodes 1-7 AND Rogue One\\, George Lucas\\, and screenwriting. it exists as a blend of left-wing political commercial\\, social justice warrior propoganda\\, diversity activism\\, bad CW sci-fi show\\, death to the concept of the Force\\, continued wasted death to the heroes of Star Wars\\, the least efficient telling of the worse excuse for a story\\, contradictory and illogical events\\, previous-storyline-nullifying presented facts\\, and just downright toilet-worth mess. the mechanics of this movie aren't worthy of a straight-to-Netflix release. absolutely pathetic. Disney would've done better just to make a 5-minute film of Kathleen Kennedy talking into the camera -- espousing radical left-wing idiocy -- and wholly foregone the idea of a movie altogether.","true":true}
