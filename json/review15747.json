Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i loved this movie. The people that seem to hate it wanted something perfect and predictable. well\\, perfection is subjective and predictable is boring. If you enjoy the star wars franchise go see it. Stop listening to fanboys that are sad their theories didn't pan out.","true":true}
