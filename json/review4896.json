Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Continuing the new trilogy this film delivers well.\\nA rollar coaster ride of emotions\\, especially for an old starwars fan like myself.\\n\\nAlthough I do not like \\\"passing of the torch\\\" stories\\, this episode of the franchise makes up for it with a lot of character development.","true":true}
