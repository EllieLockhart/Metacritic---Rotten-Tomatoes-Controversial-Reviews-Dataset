Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"NO SPOILERS\\n\\nStar Wars The Last Jedi fails to capitalise on potentially pivotal plot points\\, sufers from incoherent and inconclusive writing\\, unrelatable and bland characters (interesting ones are misused) a badly written story that does not fit into the established Star Wars universe\\, and glaring inconsistensies within itself.\\n\\nIts only saving grace is the undeniable harmony that exists between John William's legendary score and the cinematography that blends that epic tone with practical computer generated effects perfectly\\, which we wish to see more of in Episode IX","true":true}
