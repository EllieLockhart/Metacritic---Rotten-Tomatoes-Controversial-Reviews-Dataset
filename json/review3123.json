Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bad writing\\, plot holes\\, no real believable character development\\, poorly written characters\\, forced scenes meant to simply subvert expectations. Left with no believable villains in the end that would actually pose a threat. Female characters a \\\"strong\\\" just because they are female rather than actually being well developed strong characters (regardless of gender). Speaking of which\\, also a waist of some characters who had REAL potential to be GREAT characters. (Rey\\, Finn\\, Snoke\\, Poe\\, Connix\\, just to name a few)\\nI'll give it one full star\\, only because it is at least watchable. But that's mainly because it's \\\"Star Wars\\\" and has cool visual effects\\, costumes and sets.","true":true}
