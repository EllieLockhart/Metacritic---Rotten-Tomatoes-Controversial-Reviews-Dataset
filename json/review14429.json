Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had such a bad feeling when I found out Disney bought the franchise. This movie is a disgrace to everything I grew up loving and watching as a kid. The plot was recycled Star Wars and was probably doomed from the get go with some of the cast selections. How there dissolving Luke\\, Han for example is ridiculous. For that matter\\, The movies always and should carry a suspense\\, seriousness and tone that says\\, \u201cwow that\u2019s a Star Wars movie\u201d. These new films and especially this one is a joke. Humor that makes no sense for it to be in this film with a regurgitated plot. Horrible. ","true":true}
