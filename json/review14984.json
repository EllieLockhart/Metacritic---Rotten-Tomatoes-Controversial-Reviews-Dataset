Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just wanted to add some balance\\, since it looks like most of the comments to date are from the people who hated the film so viscerally that they couldn't get to sleep without spreading their hatred all over the net.\\n\\nI thought this was a great Star Wars film.  There's a lot of subtle character development\\, some beautiful shots that have to be seen to be believed\\, and (to my mind) a good balance of action and exposition.\\n\\nA few sequences were hard to justify\\, except by dint of the fact that they had to happen in order for the characters to grow.  Maybe that's sloppy storytelling\\, but I didn't feel that they dragged the story down.  I didn't even find the film overly long: I kept wanting to see more right up until the credits rolled.  And despite how some people complain about several of the iconic scenes\\, I found them to be perfectly in keeping with my understanding of the setting and its logic.\\n\\nI do feel that one of the \\\"side quest\\\" missions could have been reduced\\, or replaced\\, but overall I thoroughly enjoyed the movie as a film\\, and additionally as a sumptuous visual experience.","true":true}
