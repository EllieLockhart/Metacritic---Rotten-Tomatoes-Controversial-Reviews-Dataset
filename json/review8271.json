Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Far from the SW universe is this movie. Disney and Rian Johnson (a nobody director truth be told) have really taken to destroying the legend that SW was presenting to the world. This movie was almost Spaceballs in comparison with many scenes taken from other movies showcasing the directors lack of originality. Nothing in this movie was believable and the so called comedic lines was Disney all over a la Nickelodeon. Just rubbish......","true":true}
