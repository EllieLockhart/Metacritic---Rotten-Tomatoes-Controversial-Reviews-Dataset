Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For anyone that doesn't like this movie because it didn't give them what they asked for completely misses the purpose of film. When you submit yourself to Johnson's story you see he makes a compelling case for where the series should go.","true":true}
