Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So far the most disappointing film i have ever seen. Went into the cinema so excited\\, came out so disappointed. Too much comedy characters and parts in the film that  were not necessary at all. When i first heard who was gonna be directing this one i was already worried because of Looper which i was not very impressed with. Although saying that there were 2 or 3 very good scenes but that was it. Too little training of Rey and Luke\\, Yoda looked awful and overall belongs with the prequels.  Thank god J.J Abrams has confirmed to do the last one and i know already that the last one will be much better then this one.","true":true}
