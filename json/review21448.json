Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i would consider myself a big fan of the originals. i stood on line in 1978 for ep 4. if i were to position this movie\\, it would be in 5th place. behind original 3 + rogue one. this was better than The Force Awakens.. I think it helped that I was prepared to see a terrible movie based on all the reviews. this really was not that bad a movie. more good than bad in it. If you are interested don't get caught up with all the reviews\\, go see it with an open mind. Not everything worked for me\\, but still\\, more good than bad. enjoy the entertainment! ","true":true}
