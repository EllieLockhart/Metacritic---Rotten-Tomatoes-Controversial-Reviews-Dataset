However\\, that\u2019s where the compliments for the game start to die off. The death of one of the most loved characters Naughty Dog has produced was done in such a cheap way\\, pure disrespect to the players and to the character. You are also forced to spend 10 monotonous hours playing as the character who killed Joel\\, whilst ND try and make you feel emotion for her but instead\\, completely drag out the second half of the game and take away everything that people loved about the first game. Joel and Ellie\u2019s relationship was what made the Last of Us a success\\, and this sequel completely shattered any possibility of it living up to its predecessor within the first 2 hours. Such a sad way to kill off a once treasured franchise.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
