{"101487":131962,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-13","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If I could give it a lower rating\\, I would. But I can't\\, so it still gets half a star it doesn't really deserve.\\n\\nIf I remove from my viewing experience all knowledge of Star Wars\\, of the original trilogy and the clone wars and even TFA\\, if I ignored the blatantly racist treatment of my favorite characters\\, it would still be a bad movie.\\n\\nIt's a bad movie.\\n\\nThe writing is terrible. Rose at one point says \\\"I want to put my fist through this whole town.\\\" Luke's very last line is \\\"See you around\\, kid.\\\" (which is spoken to a 30-y-o man). At one point\\, three characters repeat \\\"What?\\\" between themselves four times. Rey's hand gets slapped with a blade of grass. Chewie eats a porg.\\n\\nIt's very confused in tone. The swelling music\\, that single horn iconic theme\\, is often undercut by a joke. In fact\\, jokes and physical comedy are so abundant that they cannot help but show up in nearly every scene\\, even the serious emotional ones. The effect is much like emotional or spiritual whiplash. Luke interrogates Rey as to where she's from\\, she insists nowhere\\, it feels like a serious moment\\, and then Luke makes a joke that Jakku really is nowhere. Between a serious moment with Leia and Luke walking onto the Falcon again\\, Chewie tries to eat a roasted porg\\, looking every bit the fake plastic prop it is\\, but is dissuaded by big\\, beady porg eyes on sad porgs. In Luke's final scene\\, I cannot be bothered to feel any great emotional weight because\\, after over 2 hours\\, the movie has trained me to expect some sort of humor interrupting the moment. Never at any point can you truly embrace an emotional moment because every single one is somehow destroyed by a bad joke or a weird\\, displaced visual gag.\\n\\nThe cinematography and editing are strange and generally bad. A wide shot of two characters facing off against each other is only askance enough to look accidental rather than intentional. A speed-shot of sprouting plants and wide sweeping shots of mountains feel like something that belong more in The Tree of Life or a nature documentary. Characters slow-mo ducking under weapons and blaster-fire feels like it's been stolen from some Guy Ritchie action flick\\, but don't occur enough for them to feel normal within the movie. So much of what is shot is dark to the point of being impossible to see. First-person views make their appearance during an action scene and it is truly nauseating. Scenes never last more than a minute or two at most\\, and even that run time is reserved for Serious Stuff. More often than not\\, shots and scenes are switched after 30 seconds or less. For 2.5 hours. There feels to be hundreds if not thousands of transitions\\, cuts\\, and scene changes over the absurdly long run time. It leaves you unable to process what you just witnessed before going on to another scene and another and another and another and by the end\\, it really feels like you've run some sort of mental marathon.\\n\\nThe CGI and practical effects are largely terrible. Engulfing flames look flat and cheap\\, filters over the void of space dilute details and make no sense\\, space debris looks like the same four models copy-pasted a hundred times and rotated a little with each placement. Luke's appearance is one scene is closer to what he looks like in Battlefront II\\, but maybe with wrinkles. The crystal foxes look different between scenes and certainly different from anything we'd seen in the press material about character creation. The not-horses are often poorly animated and clumsy and weird to look at. Some of the explosions are nice I guess?\\n\\nThen there's the issue of message and theme. The Last Jedi has no idea what we should be taking away at the end\\, characterization changes within the film itself\\, and so much is left unexplained that it's not clear how the audience is supposed to believably follow the choices of the characters. Poe gets in trouble for his attitude\\, but in the very next scene his attitude is encouraged and utilized\\, but then in the scene after that he's in trouble again. His superiors keep secrets from him and their actions appear to the audience to be rightfully frustrating\\, but then Poe's mutiny is condemned and stopped\\, but then both women who chastised\\, hurt\\, and lied to him compliment his character? More than a few characters have endless hope until they don't\\, until they do again\\, until they don't again? Rey sees Kylo and calls him murderous snake\\, tries to shoot him\\, tries to hurt him\\, calls him a monster\\, is openly confused and angry as to how Kylo could have killed Han\\, but then... after a brief encounter and a flashback\\, she suddenly believes he can be saved? Believes it so wholeheartedly that she betrays Luke\\, after criticizing to his face that he saw enough good in Vader to try and save him? Kylo seems to be\\, almost\\, maybe sad or conflicted\\, but then goes right back to a place of disgusting villainy. Are we supposed to pity him? Are we supposed to believe he was ever forgivable? It's genuinely unclear how we're supposed to feel about Rey or Kylo or Luke or Leia or Holdo or Poe or Rose at the end of this movie. About the only person you leave the movie knowing and trusting is Finn\\, as he's the only character that seems to have any kind of upward growth (never mind that it's the same story as he had in TFA).\\n\\nThe story means nothing\\, in the end. Rose and Finn and Poe are going on an aside to take care of an issue that ultimately becomes a non-issue and was\\, if Holdo is to be believed\\, never an issue to begin with. The convenient solution leaves the entire arc feeling pointless in entirety. Rey and Luke and Kylo's arc also accomplishes very little. There's a change of Power within the First Order\\, but it affects the story very little. Rey ultimately serves about the only big thing to happen; Kylo commits to the dark side. That's really it. Everything else that happens truly does not need 2.5 hours to happen. It could just as readily happen in 10\\, 20 minutes and with far less racism and far fewer lame jokes that fall about a flat as an underdone pancake.\\n\\nI won't get into everything else that this has done poorly within the context of Star Wars because it's just so much. Even on its own\\, as an individual movie\\, it's bad. Poorly written\\, poorly shot\\, poorly edited\\, poorly done in entirety. Don't bother if you're a Star Wars fan\\, don't bother if you're looking for a fun holiday blockbuster. The Last Jedi is neither.","true":true}
