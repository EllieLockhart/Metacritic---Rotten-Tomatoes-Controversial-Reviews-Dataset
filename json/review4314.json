Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Can I give it a zero? What can I tell you that hasn't been said already? I watched it on the first Friday and have spent 2 weeks trying to cope with what I saw. The script makes no sense\\, not even on Star Wars. This is worse than Phantom Menace and worse than Clone Wars. I understand what Disney is trying to do in a way but is still stupid. You guys could have finished the original story with episodes 7-9\\, and make way to whatever new stories you wanted with Star Wars. But no\\, what we got instead?\\nPoe decides to audition for Guardians of the Galaxy.\\nFinn and Rose spend 30 minutes on a mission that ends in nothing.\\nThe same Luke that turned Darth Vader into Anakin tried to kill his nephew because might turn to the dark side.\\nVice Admiral Holdo give us lessons about Tumblr.\\nBan Swolo and Rey Force Skype throughout the movie.\\nLuke moves like Neo.\\nChewbacca\\, Porgs\\, the millennium falcon\\, and cristal foxes are on display to accentuate their 2.5 lengthy commercial.\\nNo character progression what-so-ever\\, just special effects and stunning visuals. This is the kind of movie that we could expect from Michael Bay. Its garbage\\, skip it\\, wait for it on DVD\\, don't waste your money on it. \\n\\\"I'm Mary Poppins y'all.\\\" - Leia Organa","true":true}
