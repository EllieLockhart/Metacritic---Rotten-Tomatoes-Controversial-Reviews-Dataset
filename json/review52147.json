Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After the Force Awakens set this movie up for quantified success\\, it completely abandons not only it's responsibilities to the story but to the characters themselves. Very poor plot devices were used to maintain the tension throughout and also made you wonder why those problems never existed in the universe prior. The losses in this movie were made insignificant by poor decision making and I felt betrayed by what appeared to be absolute shifts in the character arcs. Hypothetically speaking the most important character had their \\\"call to action\\\" murdered in cold blood. This to me was like the end rather than leaving me wanting more. If left me with questions for which I no longer wanted or need answers. If you are going to make another one after this\\, my advice to JJ Abrams is to have Lawrence Kasdan write the 9th installment. I have watched the Force Awakens multiple times\\, this would be brutal watching a second time through.","true":true}
