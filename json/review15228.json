Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked the movie. I just couldn't stand the direction that Luke's character went in\\, he saved his father\\, but tried to kill kylo\/ben because he was a mild cunty teenager? I cannot accept it... The fan theories were all so exciting! This outcome was the most unexpected and also the least reasonable. I know Luke wasn't the main character but I still think he was a more serious and dignified character then how he was portrayed in TLJ. In honesty it ruined the experience for me (a long with the jokes). ","true":true}
