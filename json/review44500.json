Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Top two Star Wars movie. It didn\u2019t have the plot jumps a lot of the Star Wars movies have each story line ties to the main plot of the movie. People are just Butt hurt this isn\u2019t the guns blazing shoot em up movie they were expecting. Very well done. ","true":true}
