Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poor story\\, script and character development. Action and visuals as you'd expect for a Star Wars movie\\, but the most disappointing film of the entire Star Wars franchise.","true":true}
