Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a very different star wars film\\, probably explaining some bad reviews. It reminds me of Empire strikes back which was received quite poorly when it came out. This film has a great focus on characters and surprising developments. It addresses the issues that TFA was just a rehash and takes a lot of risks  Some bad reviews are seemingly just due to fan theories not coming true\\, which is bizarre. Go in with no expectations and you'll find a powerful film with rich development that rewards multiple viewings.","true":true}
