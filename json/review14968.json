Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just made an account JUST so I could rate this movie. Countless of reviews on here have already stated everything I found wrong with this sad attempt of a Star Wars movie\\, so you can just read those\\, because this is just for my pleasure of giving a half Star rating.","true":true}
