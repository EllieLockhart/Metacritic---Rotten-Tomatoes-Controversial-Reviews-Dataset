Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is no consistency within the movie\\, nor the entire star wars universe\\, it drags down the entire Star Wars experience while the movie breaks 4th wall several time to celebrate what it thinks is cleverness\\, but closer to emptiness with a drop of shallow. \\\"Subverting expectations\\\" by doing the opposite was a better plan for George Costanza than Star Wars","true":true}
