Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All style and no substance. Without delving to spoilers\\, this is full of potholes and they set alot of things up\\, in the previous film and in here\\, and set up for a good climax only to once again turn around and ditch the things they set up.","true":true}
