Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wish these 2 new ones could get a do over.  Disney has destroyed the storyline. So sad.Disney's only saving grace has been Rogue One. Lucas never should of let them touch it.","true":true}
