Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were several issues I just could not get past.  The scene with Leia being attacked on the bridge and then her return was to much like guardians of the galaxy scene .  I just could not get the emotional connection to this version.  I saw it three times and still came away just bored.","true":true}
