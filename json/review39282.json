Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film has too much humor involved\\, from the opening scene and onwards.  Too much feminism\\, not enough character development with Luke and Rey\\, bringing in new characters with no development and trying to make us have a connection with them\\, no good connections with the previous characters etc..  \\n\\nStupid scenes were abound in the movie\\, like Luke milking some sea creature????  I mean come on who on Gods green earth let this film through the writing and thought these type of scenes are well fitting in the Star Wars universe and story??  \\n\\nSnoke was not shown how powerful he was and had no development on who he was.  This film was just a total mess and both my wife and I were completely unimpressed and let down.  Wait until the movie comes out on blue ray to watch!","true":true}
