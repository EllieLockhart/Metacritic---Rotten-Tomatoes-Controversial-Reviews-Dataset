Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"People hate on this film because it\u2019s not the same old\\, good vs bad & plan to stop the bad guys and destroy their \u201cDeath Star\u201d. It pushes expectations and takes risks. People only say they want change but didn\u2019t like actually seeing it. Rian Johnson did a spectacular job. Mark Hamill preformed stunningly along with the rest of the cast. Much love for Carrie Fisher. Loved the visual effects\\, various costumes\\, creatures\\, and the PORGS! LOVED THE PORGS! Even though it does feel different\\, it\u2019s probably the BEST since Episode V.","true":true}
