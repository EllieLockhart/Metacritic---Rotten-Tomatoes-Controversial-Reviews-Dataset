Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It didn\u2019t need character development in the way a trilogy needs. They were destined to die so the back story isn\u2019t needed as much. The comedy is light not full Disney like XII and XIII. The feel is dark like empire strikes back\\, it answered a lot of questions people had and filled plot holes the original movies left. Though we don\u2019t know the characters we get the feel of what they are fighting for through self sacrifice. Even the droid captures the emotions of sacrifice for the greater good. The tie backs and respect for the original movie captured the magic of the original films. The new movies didn\u2019t do any of that. Luke should have been wiser in this film it was like Mark Hamill was playing himself.","true":true}
