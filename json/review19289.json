Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It\u0092s not quite a great movie but it\u0092s not a bad movie. I would say it has some moments that don\u0092t feel quite right compared to the other movies in this universe\\, but\\, it also surprised me with some good character development and some unorthodox plot twists which was refreshing after VII turned out to be more or less a predictable rehash of old tropes.\\n\\nI\u0092m now really curious to see how IX ties this all up.","true":true}
