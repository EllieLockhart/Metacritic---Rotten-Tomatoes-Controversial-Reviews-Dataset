Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Watched SW since I am a child. Extremely disappointed of Episode 8. Not only that the story is bad and full of mistakes\\, also the charakters are extremely boring and things we have never seen before are completely unexplained. Not even Yoda could survive in space. Luke is this old\\, unwashed\\, angry guy. And the bad guys never have a single success since they fight against Ray\\, how magically can beat everyone in any feeld she likes to. Totally not looking forward to Episode 9. \\nEffects were nice tho.","true":true}
