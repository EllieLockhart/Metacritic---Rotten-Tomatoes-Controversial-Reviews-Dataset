Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"WTF Disney?  What executive SJW just cuckholded everyone's favorite space opera?  This movie was truly horrendous.  Everything about it.  I cringed from open to close.  I would have happily walked out at any moment had it not been the one movie everyone is going to see and if I didn't want to find out just how bad the trainwreck was going to get.  \\nSpoiler Alert - it ruined Star Wars.","true":true}
