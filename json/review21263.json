Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went into this film almost completely blind. I had seen the first trailer\\, and a few snippets of information here and there. I ceased speculation\\, I stopped myself\\, and I think I had the better experience because of that. \\n\\nFor me\\, unlike the crowd\\, up until now\\, I held the original Star Wars (1977) as the best that Star Wars had... And now\\, forty years later after Lucas' masterpiece... \\n\\nRian Johnson's The Last Jedi... Is possibly the best Star Wars film we will ever see. This is the first Star Wars film that gave me the sense this universe\\, this galaxy far\\, far away\\, is lived in. Each of the four strands of this story weave together beautifully for a satisfying conclusion. \\n\\nEverything this film does emphasises that this film is Star Wars\\, but things are different\\, the legacy continues\\, but it has changed. This is not your father's Star Wars\\, even though my dad throughly enjoyed this film.\\n\\nThis film shines with what Star Wars is\\, not what the fans want it to be\\, don't expect this to be like Legends of old\\, because this film carves a new legend.\\n\\nI've seen this film twice in two days\\, and I fear that there will never be a Star Wars film greater than this... And I'm okay with that...","true":true}
