Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie takes Star Wars in a truly new direction\\, direction that for sure will divide fans\\, but for me The Last Jedi is an exceptional star wars movie\\, which I loved.\\n\\nThere were so many moments that reminded me why I love star wars in the first place. Just as a bit of context  when I left the theater for the Force Awakens I felt cheated\\, empty and not because Luke Skywalker wasn't in it. The story was just not progressing the way it was supposed to be\\, it lacked logic. Now though Star Wars finally truly feels new and original and I cannot wait for the future.","true":true}
