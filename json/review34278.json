Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The 53% audience score is bananas. I REALLY enjoyed this movie and the new and surprising direction Rian Johson took the franchise. Was it perfect? no. Were there a couple of things that I thought didn't quite fit? yes. But overall this was a fantastic film and I got almost everything I wanted from it.","true":true}
