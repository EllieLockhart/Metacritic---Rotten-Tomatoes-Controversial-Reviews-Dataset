Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not your typical Star Wars movie.  The first 7 star wars movies were action sci-fi films with.  While the last Jedi\\, has sci-fi and some action\\, the relationships and emotion seem to have more emphasis.  The movie has less of an epic feel than previous movies and feels more like a long chase sequence.  Overall the movie is mediocre at best and with a 2.5 hour runtime\\, I will not be giving it a second  chance.","true":true}
