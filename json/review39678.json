Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is actually a very good movie. The amount of people hating this movie with such a burning passion is truly shocking for me. I don't want to spoil anything for anyone who hasn't seen it yet\\, but there were very few things wrong with this film. It was a little overly long in some spots and had some strange things that I know people will find controversial\\, but it was a well made movie with a beautiful visual style and an interesting and actually thought provoking story.","true":true}
