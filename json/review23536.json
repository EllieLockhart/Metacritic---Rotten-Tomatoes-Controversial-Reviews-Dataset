Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved this movie and in the direction it went. Especially the dynamics and the obvious blossoming romance brewing between Kylo Ren and Rey. Luke's role in this film was wonderful\\, including the late and fabulous Carrie Fisher. What a way this film went. John Boyega\\, Kelly Marie Tran Tran\\, Laura Dern\\, and Oscar Isaac were the light of the film and made it worth while for me to watch it again!","true":true}
