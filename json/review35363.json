Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The juvenile humor in this movie is extremely offputting. Where JJ used Episode I as the framework for Episode VII\\, Rian thought Episode I was the perfect blueprint for a Star Wars movie. Jar Jar Binks is no longer the worst thing to happen to the Star Wars franchise. ","true":true}
