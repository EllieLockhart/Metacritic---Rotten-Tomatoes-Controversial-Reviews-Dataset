Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I so much wanted to like this movie\\, but I just can't. It is nice for the visuals and music\\, but everything else is just objectivly bad. Too much humor\\, many plotholes around the Force\\, the original trilogy\\, the force awakens\\, in the movie itself etc. So much in this movie makes no sense. I recommend watching AngryJoe's and Pewdiepie's Reviews of the Movie\\, they sum it up well. So disappointed.","true":true}
