Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dissapointing - looks past the stunning set pieces and surface level entertainment\\, we have a mess which ignore the set uo from episode 7 and spits on the character of Luke Skywalker - i suspect the director had little knowledge of the sw universe going into this and wanted his own interpretarion\\, which hit wide of the mark. Also the diseny style humour\\, though funny is overdone and off tone","true":true}
