Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best Star Wars movie ever made\\, but with so many non-sense choices (Superman Leia) and plot holes (DJ spoiling rebels escape without even Finn knowing it? And so much more) and over-saturated irony that makes it also the worst Star Wars movie ever made.\\nA golden piramid built on a ground full of sh*t.","true":true}
