Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars fan my whole life\\, I was born in '75.  This was a disappointment of a movie.  I don't see how they can fix this mess.  Too many issues on this movie to even go into details.  Side note\\, the first one the JJ did I thought was awesome.  Oh well\\, I will redbox Solo\\, only gonna get a $1.50 from me from now on until I see you can turn this around.","true":true}
