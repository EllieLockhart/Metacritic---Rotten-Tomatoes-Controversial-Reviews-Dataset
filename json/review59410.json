We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"\\\"There was a sequel...wasn't as good.\\\"\r\rThis isn't the game many of us wanted\\, but this is the story that ND wanted to tell. There are some truly great moments\\, but this game effectively destroyed everything and everyone that like minded fans loved from the first game. I think we all expected Joel to die. This was supposed to be Ellie's story. What we got was a pointless\\, miserable first half of the game with Ellie\\, and an action-packed kick-ass (save for a few moments that dragged on and on) second half of the game with a character that a lot of us hated and had no desire to play. There were points I didn't even want to continue playing. I felt nothing for Abby and her friends. I admit I am a huge fan of Joel\\, I got attached to and invested in both him and Ellie. And I never stopped hating Abby for what she did. But I didn't even dislike this game because he died.\r\rThis game is trying waaay too hard to push an agenda that it forgot what made the first game so great. Was the first game ground-breaking in it's plot or gameplay? Of course not. But we fell in love with the Joel\/Ellie dynamic. We fell in love with the side characters\\, the lore\\, and the world. I cared more about Tess\\, Bill\\, Sam and Henry\\, than I ever did about Dina\\, Jesse\\, or (especially) any of Abby's friends. This game is just an exercise in misery. There's no comic relief\\, there's no \\\"light\\\" to look for in this darkness. Even the feel good flashbacks with Joel and Ellie\\, which offered that dynamic we craved so much just made me feel sick. It's just bleak for the sake of being as bleak as possible.\r\rI got so sick of seeing Abby succeed and get her way in almost every scenario. Plot armor as thick as her arms. I love seeing more strong female characters\\, we all love to see it. But we already had that in Ellie\\, did they really have to push Abby on us so hard? Admittedly Abby is a good character\\, and if the story had been presented in a different order instead of the screeching halt at the halfway point\\, I probably could have at least felt better about her. But I never would want to play her for 10+ hours. Just no.\r\rI'm not going to say this is a bad game. This is a bad sequel.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
