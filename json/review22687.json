Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like most of the other comprehensive reviews that outline everything wrong with SWTLJ this review would have been no different\\, highlighting the same plot holes\\, terrible character development and a script that should have been condemned. However I don't have the the necessary care factor to highlight everything I didn't like about this movie in detail. I'll simply leave by saying this. You had a chance to do something special\\, something to be remembered in film history\\, something to be coveted by your peers and awarded in film loving circles\\, instead you slapped a Star Wars sticker on the box did the bare minimum and said that'll do. Thanks to the CGI team\\, well deserved. I'll be getting off this hype train now\\, this is my final stop.","true":true}
