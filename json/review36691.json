Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is  tedious and disappointing. So you know about my opinion\\, I am an original star wars fan from the 1970's seeing them as a child and then watching the middle three movies as a young adult [from pod racing to don't do it Anakin\\, I have the high ground].  My favorite all time star wars movie is The Empire Strikes back.  I was very excited when Disney bought the franchise and placed JJ Abrams in charge as his take on the Star Trek movies was fantastic.  The Force Awakens was a great movie and saw it 10+ times.  Loved Rogue One\\, very well done.  Could not wait to see the Last Jedi and what became of Luke\\, the movie lost my attention after 30 minutes and I was patiently waiting for it to find it's own  star wars path but never did. It simply did not touch that spark of feeling like a kid again and seeing the star wars universe though my childhood eyes like the force awakens achieved. Seemed like a corporate run movie where every department at Disney had an uninspired hand in the creation of this movie.","true":true}
