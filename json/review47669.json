Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When did star wars become \\\"star women\\\"?  Seems as though everyone making the movie\\, disney\\, the critics are all patting themselves on the back for the character diversity (read women).  The fans however\\, are writing the actual reviews. The movie had its moments but it seemed as though they were doing \\\"everyone gets a participation trophy\\\" since there was very little holding a real plot together. Leah can fly in space.........awful. Snoke can see into every thought but missed the part about the lightsaber pointed at his pelvis? I know this isn't about actual realism but if a  director strings together enough completely ridiculous scenarios it isn't a movie\\, it's a farce.  Unfortunately I laughed at the film not with the content.  Two years for this???? Why? Why? Why?","true":true}
