{"101487":155551,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My review of Star Wars The Last Jedi\\n\\nThe Positive:\\n\\nGreat visuals and some mind blowing special effects\\, some of the ideas and concepts i.e. Canto Bite were interesting even though not executed or realised sufficiently to make it satisfying. There were some magical moments like reunion scenes i.e. Luke & R2\\, Chewie & Luke\\, Luke & Yoda (even though Yoda looked a little odd) that were genuine & heartfelt. \\\"Some\\\" of the humour was on point and hit the mark and there were moments of shear brilliance. The problem is there weren't enough of these moment and far too many moments of disappointment or just moments that felt - well \\\"odd\\\" which takes me to the negative \\\"prepare to go into hyper-drive\\\"\\n\\nThe Negative:\\n\\nThe Force Awakens was branded a rehash of previous films and yes even though I would agree at least the story was coherent and made sense\\, the character development was satisfying and it set things up perfectly in regards to paying respectful homage to the past and creating mystery for the future (for future films to address). Everything I have mentioned here The Last Jedi tries to either undermine or undo\\, I honestly feel The Last Jedi is a victim of trying to hard to be what it needs to be \\\"Original\\\" and \\\"Unpredictable\\\" and in trying so hard to be these things it falls flat on every single hurdle\\,  so let me go into detail of what I thought was wrong with the movie.\\n\\nFirst off the Humour - The Force Awakens paid respectful homage to the original films in regards to recreating the humour recipe that those films created and carefully balanced the humour with serious moments. The Last Jedi literally tries to rewrite the rules with this\\, making it come across as a spoof or a piss take. The scene where Luke throws the saber over his shoulder could have been taken straight from an episode of the Simpson's\\, General Hux was turned into a bad stand up comedian repeating the same jokes over and over\\, which rather than funny comes across as very tedious in the end. \\n\\nOdd moments - There were a few really odd moments in TLJ\\, the one that springs to mind first and foremost is the character that should have been handled with so much care\\, because the actress is no longer with us. There were at least two moments in the movie in which could have been used to respectfully send off this character\\, but instead they decided to turn these ideal moments into a bit of a joke. The moment Princess Leia was quite literally turned into superman was such a strange moment and very awkward\\, an experience I have never had viewing a Star Wars movie. Not only did this make literally no sense at all considering Leia never had any Jedi training\\, it was such a disrespect to the character and talented actress whom is no longer with us. Luke milking a huge sea cow like walrus and drinking it\\, with a wink to the camera like it had been taken from an advert was again a scene that belonged in an episode of the Simpson's. Its moments like this that made me feel very uncomfortable as a viewer. Rey was one of the great characters developed in TFA\\, her character was developed really well by JJ Abraham's\\, she worked really well with the character Kylo Ren whom was consumed by evil but had a pull to the light side. She saw this character murder his own father in TFA\\, even referring to him as a monster in the previous movie yet in this movie she is getting all hot and bothered by seeing him with no top on - go figure!\\n\\nIncoherent story - The majority of this movie was one big chase and whilst some of it was entertaining from a visual \/ effects side of things it didn't make a great deal of sense. The little Maz Kanata snippet could have been taken straight from a video game\\, \\\"you need to find the master code breaker to progress to the next level\\\"\\, its almost like they needed to include this character and couldn't come up with how to\\, so they did this just to include that character. And whilst the Canto Bite segment was in theory a great concept\\, the execution was all wrong and the entire scene felt like it was a completely different movie entirely\\, completely unnecessary and a waste of half an hour where this time could have been utilised developing other characters that so desperately needed it. The whole Finn and Rose romance thing was unengaging and did not resonate what so ever and Poe's character development was absolutely pointless.\\n\\nPoorly copied scenes from previous movies being conveyed as original - The scene on the new planet Crait was practically a copy of Hoth but being conveyed as original when its not\\, Hoth was a much longer scene and added impact to a very tense part of Empire. This scene in Last Jedi being towards to end of the movie rather than the begging does anything but this coming across as kids playing with toys as oppose to a proper convincing war like Empire conveyed.\\n\\nUnfulfilled promises and unsatisfying answers to questions - TFA set up things so well story wise ready for an eventual pay off in subsequent films. Snoke was such a powerful character and hinted at being probably one of the most villainous characters ever\\, even stating himself that he'd been there from the very begging (before all the Star Wars movies). Yet he gets killed so simply that just makes you gasp and sigh in annoyance\\, almost like Tyson biting Holyfield's ear off and it abruptly and dissatisfyingly ending. Rey again such an important character in this new trilogy and it was set up so well in TFA in regards to her parentage mystery. She could have been a Skywalker\\, Solo\\, Kenobi\\, a descendant of the dark side or even an avatar kind of character being the chosen one \\\"Vader\\\" reborn. But no they decided to go with an overwhelming bombshell that topped any of these ideas - she is a little orphan mary sue with wino parents whom sold her for drug money\\, wow - never expected that! From an audience perspective these things are so disrespectful not just to the Star Wars heritage but comes across as a huge slap in the face\\, almost making it feel like Disney is laughing at us. \\n\\nHints at things that were going to happen but never did - Rey's training barely happened yet we are lead to believe she is now a fully fledged Jedi by the end of the movie. Luke's training as short as it was in Empire felt like an eternity in comparison\\, Rey is obviously very powerful with the force with barely any training\\, yet we are still lead to believe she is a nobody - eh OK? Showing Luke's X-wing submerged makes no sense unless he was going to raise it up out of the water at some point during the movie\\, (which would have paid great homage to Empire) and use it to fly and save the day as Jedi Master Luke - but it never happened. Instead he decided to stay on his cosy little island and use his force abilities to project himself\\, yeah that's a better idea let's go with that one.\\n\\nDisrespect to the foundations laid down in previous films and disservice to fans - BB8 is the new R2-D2 that much is for certain\\, as much as I love the character it made no sense to bring R2-D2 back to life purely to give us the map to find Luke or to remind Luke of the good O'l times\\, this was a disservice to the character originally created by Lucas. Everyone anticipated the return of Luke Skywalker\\, but the way they treated his character and the heritage of his character was a complete lack of respect. Luke was willing to sacrifice himself in order to bring his father (whom he'd only known for 5 mins) back to the light side\\, yet we are lead to believe that this is the same character whom is willing to murder his own nephew whom he'd been training for years all because he senses a little darkness in him? This makes literally no sense at all considering the characters development thus far and completely contradicts what's gone before.\\n\\nAll in all an entertaining movie\\, but a hugely disappointing Star Wars Movie that does not deliver on anything that was promised or hinted at in the previous instalment and pays little to no respect to the overall Star Wars Legacy & Lore.\\n\\nEnjoy!!","true":true}
