Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As someone who grew up watching Star Wars\\, in a family that truly loved the films\\, I was both thrilled by The Last Jedi\\, and totally unsurprised to hear that some fans 'hate it. \\n\\nFirst\\, I think we all need to pause and remember something vitally important in this: there will never be a truly awful Star Wars movie. Hold on\\, let me explain.. I want you to sit back\\, and expand your mind to include every movie made in the last 30 years. For the sake of argument\\, let's include indie but not B movies. Have that mass lying before you? Good. Now\\, take a moment and remember some truly awful movies you have seen. Movies with bad acting\\, shotty cinematography\\, poor sound\\, poorly constructed script..maybe it was more than one of the above.\\n\\nNow I want you to zoom back in to the Star Wars movies. I\\, for one\\, still get a little cringy about Episodes I-III\\, even for some if the reasons listed above\\, but if I remove the ingrained adoration and expectations that I\\, a born and bred fan\\, have for how a character 'should be\\, I can admit that the worst part of the whole first III episode business is probably that Episode I feels like 133 mins of intro. \\n\\nIn fact\\, Star Wars Episode I\\, is a fantastic measuring tool for even the most devoted Star Wars fanatic. Searching for Episode I on Google will present you with tags including 'kid friendly' 'bad acting' 'cringe worthy 'boring' and 'great music. Further scanning will present a Rotten Tomato score of 55%. While this surprises me\\, I have to say in this case\\, I definitely\\, as a fan agree.\\nHowever\\, what I absolutely cannot comprehend\\, as a fan or simply as a movie lover in general is how ANYONE could see these 2 movies and rate them equally. What!? \\n\\nWe\\, as one of the largest fandoms in the entire planet\\, have some pretty deeply held feelings and expectations for Our characters. I can testify personally to this. When I found out one of the major original characters would be killed in The Force Awakens\\, I simply refuses to see it until I felt I could be emotionally objective about that so as not to ruin the actual film for myself. I'll be honest\\, I watched TFA for the first time 4 days ago. YES. THAT recently. As a fan was it heartbreaking to see one of my favorites die? HELL YES! But while watching the film\\, I also was just as heartbroken to know what terrible parents my favorites had been\\, and that our new villain was of their creation. I was totally in love with Rey and amused by Poe and protective of Finn. I rejoiced in the possibility of a girl Jedi\\, and beamed with pride at my daughters' excitement. I also felt alarmed and panicked about Kylo Ren..waiting with baited breath for him to show any sign of light still in him. As a fan\\, I was as much in denial of evil being the offspring of his parentage as Luke 'disappearing. \\n\\nSo let me put it this way.. If you walked in expecting huggable old Luke\\, or an easily detestable Kylo Ren\\, or a less unstable Rey\\, then you don't understand how this gig works. If these are your gripes and reasons for low scoring TLJ\\, you do the creators\\, actors\\, and crew a great disservice. Simply put\\, ratings based on personal feelings and not actual quality are unfair.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi was beautifully shot\\, well written\\, well acted\\, with excellent scoring and awesome special effects. It included many good messages and superb emotional connections between characters. (Fan review::Luke is selfish and jaded with a questionable plan for redeeming himself\\, Leia was a fucking legend\\, Rey was impressively stoic while still being emotionally available\\, and Kylo Ren is the most compassion inspiring villain in my movie watching memory. If he didn't win you over as someone worth redemption in the TFA\\, he will now. Plus\\, he's beasty buff. Shootouts to Poe and Finn for being new favorites with convincing character growth and Rose for being a relatable\\, everyday hero.)","true":true}
