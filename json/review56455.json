Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The director was given the keys to the corvette and he crashed and burned.\\n\\nLuke Skywalker is Classic Americana and he was made a punchline.\\n\\nI can forgive the Force Awakens for being a reboot\\, and setting up future movies\\, but The Last Jedi did not deliver. It felt like a reboot of a reboot.\\n\\nPoor writting made for a shallow character played by Laura Dern\\, it created a whole nonsensical subplot which included the Finn and Rose characters.\\n\\nJJ Abrams better fix the franchise fast\\, or Disney isn't getting another dime of my money.","true":true}
