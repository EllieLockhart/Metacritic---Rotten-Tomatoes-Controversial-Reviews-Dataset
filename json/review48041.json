Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While parts of the movie were tacky\\, all in all the film was phenomenal to watch. It was stunning visually\\, and was very funny in certain parts. I felt that characters established in The Force Awakens were developed nicely and that characters introduced in this movie weren't wasted. It was a really good movie\\, but it was not perfect. \\nWhat could make it better?:\\nRecent Star Wars movies have made a habit of slow pacing until the third act. I believe that if the movie had the same pacing and character development as the third act\\, it would be a much better\\, and near perfect movie. \\nI give it an 8.5\/10","true":true}
