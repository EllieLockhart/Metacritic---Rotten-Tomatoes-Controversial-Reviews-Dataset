Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film comes off as a film for people with ADHD made by people on meth. It's one big threat after another without much time to breath or build character\\, plot\\, or real interest yet at the same time the whole film is just one long slow chase in space.\\n\\nIt was like Battlestar Galactica mixed with Empire Strikes Back - they even have a version of the snowspeeders against AT Walkers - with a pointless side story that goes nowhere with Finn and another one with Rey that ends with the death of someone who should have seen it coming. It's so disjointed and unfocused. It fees very much like a movie made by committee where different groups worked on separate scenes and plotlines but there was no one there to mesh it all together into a coherent story.","true":true}
