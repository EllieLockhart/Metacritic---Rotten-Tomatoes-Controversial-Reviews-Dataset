Again great gameplay but the story fell off a cliff. This storyline tanked the franchise for me. You won't get me to waste my time again. Metacritic seems to be blocking actual negative user criticism. So let's see if this gets posted. TO BE CLEAR: I don't appreciate behind classified as some sort of phobic because I didn't not like the game. My review is not malicious\\, nor the product of some conspiracy. Again\\, the story line was very weak at best  in my opinion. I loved the prior instalments and this did not come close.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
