Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointed with this movie..... so many things wrong with it... I don\u2019t even know where to begin... I\u2019m a huge StarWars fan and if anyone sees it and they \u201clike\u201d it\\, then they have never seen any of the other Star Wars... I will sum this movie up in four reasons why. 1) No answer for Ray and who she connects with. 2) Snoke just randomly dies? 3) and no epic fighting battle between Luke and Kyler Ren? 4) Leia has the force when she was flown into space??? What?!?!? This movie should\u2019ve been better but they ruined in. ","true":true}
