Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is like a forceful way of letting you know things like equality and diversity. the original starwars movies IV-VI; the force awakens is good\\, rogue one is good too: it shows diversity and equality in subtle ways that they add to the beauty of it as a whole. There are so many plot holes but these are the ones i felt that are so annoying. Firstly ray's character is like so unreal\\, you cannot relate to her story as a hero\\, she is too perfect? and why build her background story i such a way that she is related with the skywalker or kenobi\\, i have no problem of her being a nobody but building her story like that unbelievable. Secondly\\, the villains story arcs\\, well there is none..they just introduce them and killed them off\\, would they even matter at all? they seem to be just elaborate props. Thirdly\\, the journey finn and rose\\, utterly useless. Another would be no sense of chain of command. And i think they did not honor Luke because well in the prequels he believed that his father could be good again and with just a hint of darkness in his nephew he just decides to kill him. Why leave a map if you dont want to be found? Like its all a joke. Wouldn't it be cool if Luke really fought there\\, it would have been a more satisfying and appropriate ending for a hero like him rather than wither away at a planet.","true":true}
