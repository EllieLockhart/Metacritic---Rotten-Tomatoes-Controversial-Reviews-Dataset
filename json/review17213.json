Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really loved the movie. I've been a fan of the saga since I was a kid and this one was so refreshing in comparison to all the other films that share this universe. Even my father who's a hardcore fan as I am loved it\\, he thought it was an exciting and powerful movie.\\nI think that the hate that the movie is receiving comes from people who were blinded by their own expectations or spoiled themselves with false theories\\, and where waiting that their vision came true in the film\\, but that's what's so amazing about TLJ\\, it took everyone by surprise by taking an unexpected direction almost in every way possible.\\nI think the most pure reaction that I've seen was the one from my father\\, a person that doesn't theorizes or spoils himself in any form prior seeing a movie\\, a person who grew up with these universe deep inside his soul and loves everything in it\\, even the prequels\\, and that's because when these movies start he's immediately transported to these Galaxy far far away\\, and starts enjoying the ride.\\nI really think that if you can't put your ego aside and you end up hating a movie just because it isn't what you expected it to be then you're depriving yourself of being amazed and surprised by new things or fresh perspectives.","true":true}
