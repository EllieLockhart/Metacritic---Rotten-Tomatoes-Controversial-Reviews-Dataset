Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I gave this movie 1\/2 star only because Mark Hamill was in the movie\\, Rian Johnson ruined the series by making this crap of a movie. My father and I have been to EVERY StarWars movie together since 1977. We won't be wasting anymore money seeing these in the theater. ??.  It is a shame that he felt he had to turn the greatest movie series of all time into ??????????","true":true}
