Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An unoriginal movie that abused the source material by ignoring rules previously established in a sci-fi universe. The movie has a serious anti-capitalist bend that ignores how the resistance would actual work\\, and setting up the resistance as an organization that would rely on receiving materials out of guilt as opposed to paying for anything.","true":true}
