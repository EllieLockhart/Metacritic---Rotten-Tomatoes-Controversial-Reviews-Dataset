Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While this movie had amazing visuals\\, it felt as if the actual story was made up as they went along. Without spoiling anything\\, I would say that this movie  was not a disappointment however\\, the plot lacked any real focus which detracted from the story that they were trying to tell.","true":true}
