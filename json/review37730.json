Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There was more than one thing wrong with the movie\\, but I made an account just to say it was still amazingly enjoyable and quite simply magical. It seems like people just want something to hate sometimes and this is one of those things. I am a huge fan of and love the originals and I loved this movie as well. ","true":true}
