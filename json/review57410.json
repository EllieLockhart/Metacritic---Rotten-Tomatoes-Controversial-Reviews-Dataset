Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a huge disappointment to me. I was excited to see what was to come with the new Characters of Rey\\, Finn\\, and Poe as the old ones pasted the torch and closed out their stories. I enjoyed the Force Awakens\\, even with its flaws\\, but now because of this one I can't watch it either. \\n\\nThe humor in this movie was just bad and off-putting. If it wasn't just plain dumb\\, it was a complete tonal switch that disrupted any tension that the poor script provided. \\n\\nMark Hamill was amazing as always even though his character was a complete 180 of the original portrayal of Luke. There was no effort to endear Rey's character to the audience\\, and almost a creepy forced relationship between her and the main villain. Finn's character was great in the FA\\, fun\\, exciting\\, and hilarious. In this one he was turned into the janitor of the first order and sent on a meaningless side quest. Poe\\, \\\"the greatest pilot in the resistance\\\" was told to just follow orders and went along for the ride on an extremely slow and boring space chase. \\n\\nI loved Rogue One. I went and enjoyed Solo\\, even though The Last Jedi left a bad taste in my mouth. Unfortunately\\, I have no want or need to see Episode 9. Everything interesting has been taken out of this trilogy by Rian Johnson. What is left is not worth taking the time to go see. Good luck JJ.","true":true}
