Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointed. That was a terrible ending for the most iconic character of the franchise. And Snoke could have been a great character and story line. WTF Rian Johnson and Disney? So disappointed. ","true":true}
