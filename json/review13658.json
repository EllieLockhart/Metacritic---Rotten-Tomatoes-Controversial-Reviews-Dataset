Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If I could give this movie a lower rating\\, I would. This movie is now my least favorite movie in the entire Star Wars franchise. So much wasted time and energy in this movie. Maybe Disney thought Episode 7 was too much of a rehash of a Episode 4 so they decided to do something so different that everyone would be divided on it and no longer trust the critics. The plot holes alone make me question whether or not Disney bought critics and websites (including this one) so they could trick audiences into thinking this would be a movie worth seeing. Sadly\\, it is not.","true":true}
