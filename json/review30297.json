Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sci-Fi Movie - 7\/10\\nStar Wars Movie - 3\/10\\n\\nFor a casual viewer there is a lot to enjoy here\\, some humour action and adventure\\, it you just want to watch a film for a few hours and enjoy yourself and then forget about it you will have a good time.\\n\\nHowever if you are a Star Wars fan then this is awful\\, any gains in the wider universe made by our heroes in the original trilogy are now completely worthless\\, any character developments are also undone. The threads established in the force awakens are also undone\\, no one is of any consequence and can be killed of at random\\, so why should I care about any character when in 30 years time anything they have achieved is for nothing.\\n\\nIncredibly this somehow hurts worse than the prequels\\, disney has ruined my favourite thing not by being bad film-makers  (objectively as I say there is good work here) but by being lazy and sloppy\\, if the entire cast is killed off between this and IX I honestly wouldnt be that bothered. What a waste.","true":true}
