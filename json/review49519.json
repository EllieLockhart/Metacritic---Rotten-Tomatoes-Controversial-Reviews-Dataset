Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow disappointment is an understatement. As a action packed stand-alone movie it was ok. As a movie part of the Star Wars saga it was horrendous. Rian Johnson literally destroyed 40 years of Star Wars in 2 and half hours. How anyone can say this movie was great is baffling. Too many plot holes. What happened to the other force ghost characters??? Did they all go on a force vacation. Either your not a Star Wars fan and this was probably your first one ever or something fishy is going on with Disney and these critics reviewing the movie. Very sad to look back and see Mark Hamill's interviews. You can just tell he disagreed with it all and just faked smiled his way these past 2 years. Disney please give George Lucas a call and mail him a blank check. Tell him you need him ASAP. What a huge let down smh","true":true}
