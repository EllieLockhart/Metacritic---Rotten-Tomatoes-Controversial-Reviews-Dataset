{"101487":169698,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-03","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Starts of with a bang and then that scene with Finn and Rose comes along... This Rose character is only noteworthy for me in that she usurped Finn's place as the 2nd worst Star Wars character. The fact that so much of the movie was devoted to the 2 is unbelievable. But back to the scene itself...It just ruined the immersion for me. I would compare the experience to having great foreplay in a nice bedroom with great 5.1 surround music (the movie intro) and then having your girl\/boyfriends' parents barge in the room and start talking about calculating taxes for 5 minutes. It's going to take a while to get back in the mood after they've left. I feel like I only got back into that beautiful feeling of wonder cinema gives you (which Star Wars is particularly excellent at) in parts here and there after that.\\n\\nWhereas Rose and Finn are concerned\\, everything involving them is terrible writing. After the boring\\, disengaging technical talk between them and the later explanation of the same thing in differently boring language to Poe\\, this time with visuals\\, we get the whole casino\/rich-assholes-planet story. It never truly feels like a Star Wars movie in these scenes\\, especially within the casino. Everything seems manufactured just to show us that rich people make money off war\\, that nice shiny things hide ugly truths\\, and to make us feel bad about animal and child exploitation. And at the end\\, before they're rescued by DJ (the guy that can do everything that only this other very specific guy was supposed to be able to do\\, who they didn't even stumble upon\\, but who got introduced to them by the same event that prevents them from getting to the other specific dude) the climax of the scene is Rose (with yet another Knives Chau look of awe on her face) saying \\\"this makes it worth it\\\"\\, as if those animals they set free (not the children sleeping beside those animals mind you) aren't going to just be rounded up again in like 30 minutes after they leave. Adding to this\\, Finn states that at least they trashed the rich-assholes' casino\\, as if the damage made was anything the rich assholes can't fix with money. \\n\\nEnter Phasma...Ok\\, now we're talking! Wait\\, what!? That's it!? I was initially let down with her short screen time in TFA\\, but then thought that this was just a tease for a bigger role in TLJ\\, so I was ok with it. But...this? More limited screen time\\, only to be killed off? That's the end of the chrome trooper? What a waste. Then again\\, she might resurface from the ashes in Episode IX\\, but that would still make her an underused character in 2 whole movies.\\n\\nThe glorious ending to the whole Rose\/Finn saga is neither glorious nor an ending. Rather than letting Finn\\, a character who in theory was interesting but never lived up to much\\, have an honorable ending\\, they have Rose sabotage his sacrifice. To add insult to injury\\, after reversing\/denying (a lot of this going on in the movie) this climax\\, she spurts some nonsense about you not winning by defeating your enemy but by saving your friends\\, as if the 2 are mutually exclusive. As if she's giving us a pearl of wisdom here. Ridiculous. \\n\\nAnd what is the reason for the adventures of the worst characters since he-who-shall-not-be-named taking up all this space? Commander Holdo deciding to keep her plans all to herself\\, even when having a blaster pointed at her face by Poe. She could have just explained the situation right then and there\\, prompting Poe to go \\\"...oh\\\"\\, and embarrassingly holstering his gun. But no\\, instead\\, she starts a firefight between Rebel forces\\, on board the last Rebel starship. Wow. \\n\\nNow onto Rey\\, Luke and Kylo. I came across the term \\\"Mary Sue\\\" (feel free to read this as \\\"Marty Stu\\\"\\, the gender is irrelevant) while reading other reviews here\\, and I'm afraid it really is fitting Rey's character. I liked her portrayal in TFA as a young\\, rebellious\\, strong\\, independent girl. But this...they just went too far. After being able to effortlessly psychically link with someone else for half of the movie (I can live with that. Don't buy it entirely\\, even with Snoke's mediation but ok) she fights off imperial guards that put Kylo Ren\\, the guy that's trained since childhood under Luke Skywalker himself and then under Snoke\\, in a bind\\, like it's nothing. As if all the lightsaber training she needed was chopping that rock in half. Then again\\, she defeated Ren at the end of TFA\\, so that should have been\\, and was\\, for some\\, a pretty big exaggerated-power-level warning. Her bond with Ren was a very interesting\\, or even arguably\\, the most interesting part of the movie\\, and Snoke's death would have been a satisfying and very cool resolution to it\\, if it had taken place in Episode IX\\, but this conclusion meant killing off The Supreme Leader (now that title\\, unlike \\\"Snoke\\\"\\, sounds threatening) which feels incredibly cheap after never having gotten answers to so many questions surrounding him. Who was Snoke? Was he Sidious' master? How did he come to power? How did he get those scars? Is he a deformed human? An alien? Why on earth would you name a major villain \\\"Snoke\\\"? Nothing. Another expectation formed by TFA brought to an anti-climax. 3 years worth of nerd conspiracies lying on the floor with Snoke's severed body (Are we to read anything into that ignominious depiction of Snoke's lifeless face\\, looking like roadkill? Is Rian Johnson telling us this guy doesn't matter? That he never did?). At the end of Rey's story\\, when she faces the rocks\\, I thought she would blast them with the Falcon. But no. She lifts what is probably a few tons of rocks\\, again\\, like it's nothing. I'm all for strong female characters\\, but c'mon.\\n\\nThe training portion of the film is never satisfying like Luke's training with Yoda was. And there's not a lot of actual training ever going on. The dark hole scene was interesting\\, but it never really means anything. Wasn't that hole supposed to represent the darkness? Aside from the ominous animal bones there wasn't a lot of darkness or evil to be found down there. There was nothing to be found\\, actually\\, other than a reflection. The \\\"answer\\\"\\, by the way\\, to another buildup from TFA that was unceremoniously treated in TLJ. Is Rey Luke's daughter? Does she have Skywalker blood? Were her parents murdered? Nope. They were just some two-bit scavengers who sold her for food or drink. Oh and they're dead and buried back in Jakku. The planet where you were waiting for them to come back for you. Ouch.\\n\\nNow Kylo Ren. I would have assumed that he would have gotten past the rebellious-emo-teenager\/redemption point after killing his father\\, but still\\, he hesitates. It is just the beginning of the movie\\, and it is his mother in his gunsight\\, after all\\, so fair enough. But then he spends the majority of the movie stuck in his divide\\, his hesitation. We see it in his facial expressions. He has not yet fully committed himself to the dark side. What gives? Not until the end do we see that he was only playing the role to usurp Snoke's throne. Yet this does not explain everything. It wasn't just a ruse. You can still feel his doubt\\, him being split in two. Even after his final frame\\, you still don't see him as the main antagonist\\, the heir to Vader's name. Now with with The Supreme Leader gone\\, is this the main bad guy? Is this our generation's Darth Vader? Really? Now that Snoke (which is what they should have named the Porgs\\, not the main antagonist\\, but well...) is gone\\, literally the evilest of them all is General Hux\\, whom they make fun of and caricaturize throughout the film. He literally looks and acts like one of those angry young dudes holding tiki torches in Charlottesville\\, if you made one a general and gave him a starship to chase and kill people with. \\n\\nAs for Luke\\, I'm not quite sure what to make of his portrayal. I liked the idea of him living in seclusion\\, and when he finally agrees to train Rey\\, you think \\\"oh it's on!\\\". But in the end\\, we get more chasing\\, convincing\\, hesitation\\, fishing\\, and gross milk-drinking than actual training out of the Luke and Rey storyline. Then a welcome and unexpected guest; Yoda. Who after providing welcome insight and wisdom\\, literally sets fire to the Jedi legacy\\, and laughs about it. If we were left wondering when Luke was going to answer the question of \\\"why the Jedi should end\\\"\\, neither he nor Yoda really make this clear. Given the fact that the dark side is growing stronger while the light is diminishing\\, none of what Luke and Yoda say towards the Jedi having to end makes any sense. And about burning the Jedi legacy? The sacred religious texts? Another reverse\/denial. They're shown to be safely on board the Millenium Falcon at the end. Luke Skywalker's final showdown is briefly epic\\, ending in another reverse move; it's just a projection. I'm not sure if I like this or if it's a cop-out\\, but I did like his Obi Wan death. However\\, was this a cop-out as well? The very short fight scene between Luke and Kylo can objectively be considered anti-climactic considering the epic Neo-at-the-end-of-The-Matrix buildup.\\n\\nRegarding some classic characters\\, it feels like they were underused\\, contributing almost nothing to the story. Almost brushed aside. Chewbacca feels purposeless without Han\\, and is only used for Porg jokes. R2-D2 makes a welcome appearance\\, providing a great moment in the film\\, when he shows Luke the original message for Obi Wan that started it all. This prompts Luke to deliver the brilliant meta line of \\\"that was a cheap shot\\\". However\\, after this great exchange\\, he never appears again. Another expectation from TFA\\, when we see him dormant\\, waiting for Luke\\, ending in deception. Luke is back\\, so give R2 a minute and a half with him and put him back in the bin. The C-3P0 I lovingly remember from TFA as making every scene shine with classic portrayal and nostalgia is only semi-present here. He doesn't have that same charm\\, and save that last scene where Poe tells him to be quiet\\, he wasn't very memorable. He was just\\, there. \\n\\nLeia initially does her part\\, as expected\\, and then we get the \\\"Superman returning from space\\\" moment.    When did she become so powerful with the force that she can survive in the vacuum of space? This is probably the first reverse\/denial moment in the film. We see Leia's heroic death\\, except\\, not. All this serves for in the movie is to introduce commander Holdo\\, who only serves to unnecessarily cause an insurrection and firefight among the rebels\\, which\\, worse of all\\, sets up Poe to sanction Rose and Finn's adventure on the casino planet. I honestly cannot get over how poorly written this movie is. The worst part of the 2 hours and a half is definitely everything involving Rose and Finn's mission\\, but the worst part of that is the fact that it is a completely unnecessary and irrelevant part of the movie. A very long part. And to add to that\\, they never even complete the mission! The irrelevance of actions becomes apparent again in the end. Holdo's grand plan was to distract the First Order with the starship\\, so the Rebels could hide and regroup in the nearby planet. Half or more of the Rebel forces get blasted en route to the planet\\, have their hideout torn apart and are chased out of the planet again. No one in the Outer Rim even responds to their transmission\\, with only the Millenium Falcon appearing to save them. But before\\, we get Holdo's sacrifice. Could she not have done the kamikaze move\\, before\\, I don't know\\, all but like 6 spaceships were blown up by the First Order? Clearly\\, after the first spaceship was blown up\\, she should have realized that the distraction plan was out the window. I'll admit though\\, that visually the sequence was stunning\\, but it was much too late.\\n\\nOther minor things in the movie; The Porgs\\, the island nuns\\, the crystal foxes. Was there a point to any of this? The Porgs only serve for \\\"Baby Groot\\\" jokes (I haven't even seen either GOTG movies but I think I understand the reference people are making\\, at least regarding these things)\\, and obviously for merchandising cute plush toys. The island nuns come out of nowhere to unsettle the mood of the island scenes and provide comedic relief that no one asked for. The crystal foxes also come out of nowhere and only serve to look cute and show the Rebels the way out of the base. Kind of forced. Besides\\, they look even more CGI than the Porgs\\, which helps in making this movie feel and look like something other than a Star Wars film. I'm not against innovation\\, but much of the directing and editing choices made in this film threw me out of the \\\"Star Wars Universe\\\" immersive experience. Again\\, Kylo and Rey's story was very interesting\\, but their whole psychic exchange\\, at least visually and in tone\\, felt like something belonging to a different kind of movie. Same goes for the dark hole scene. The multiple Reys looked awesome\\, and offered a very cool and trippy opportunity to play with visuals and sound. Yet it felt like something that would belong in any other sci-fi movie\\, not a Star Wars one. Add to that the fact that the scene is completely irrelevant\\, as the only thing the cave shows Rey is her own reflection. It's all for show. This brings me to the showdown with the imperial guard. The scene looks awesome\\, but it doesn't feel like a Star Wars fighting scene. Again\\, I don't mind the films being altered a bit\\, updated. But if the prequels taught us anything it's that it is a mistake to stray too far from the original trilogy. JJ Abrams understood this (perhaps a little too well) with The Force Awakens. This is the same man who took the Star Trek franchise and turned it on its head. Then again\\, we had some welcome innovative moments in TFA\\, such as the stormtrooper fighting with the shock baton scene\\, but we go from that to a battle royale between 2 jedis and a room full of imperial guards. Again\\, I enjoyed the scene\\, but it visually felt like it belonged elsewhere. It's probably the fact that the movie in many parts doesn't have a very Star Wars feel to it that makes me pick on that scene.\\n\\nIn conclusion\\, I have come to understand what I read in passing before seeing this movie\\, about some fans wanting it to be removed from Star Wars canon. It can't possibly be that bad\\, I thought. It must be nitpicking about a specific thing in the movie. Unfortunately\\, that is not the case\\, and with great sadness\\, I join the choir calling for this movie to be removed from the saga. The best-case scenario would be for Episode VIII to be completely remade\\, under Abrams with a script by him\\, or honestly\\, by anyone else other than Rian Johnson. This was supposed to be this generation's Empire Strikes Back\\, and instead we're left with a movie more poorly written that any of the prequels. Shame on you\\, Rian Johnson. Shame on you\\, Disney.","true":true}
