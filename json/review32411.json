Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars is finally aiming beyond it's horizons\\, a fresh film that breaks from tradition and aim the series to new heights\\, expand the galaxy beyond the typical super powers. It took the best parts of the originals and aimed for a deeper and more complex setting. \\n\\nIt's not perfect\\, but no movie is. I can not wait for the sequel.","true":true}
