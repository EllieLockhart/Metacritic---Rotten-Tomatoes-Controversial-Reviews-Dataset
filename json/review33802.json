Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie. This trilogy now has no direction and it makes it seem like there was really zero connection between it and TFA. And what they did to Luke and how they sent him out? Terrible. And don't get me started about the Superman Leia scene.. Horrible horrible movie.","true":true}
