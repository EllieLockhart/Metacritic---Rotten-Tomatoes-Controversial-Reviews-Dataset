Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a life long Star Wars fan until now. I thought the plot was pretty weak and didn't really interest me. The characters were really uninspired and didn't really do anything. Finn and Phasma were both badly under used and frankly wasted. Above all I found what they did to Luke Skywalker to be a big let down. He was the biggest hero to me from being a small child and this felt like a strange and disrespectful insult to everything he stood for. Its sad to see so many bad decisions running a once loved franchise into the ground by damaging it's established characters. It sounds silly but this movie along with Force Awakens has made me dislike Star Wars. I was always the star wars kid but now it just makes me cringe. It didn't have to be this way but they seem to show zero respect for the fans and zero creativity. The Apple has fallen far from the tree.","true":true}
