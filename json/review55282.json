Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Leftist political subtext throughout this mess. While these films continue to bear the face of Star Wars and our attendant nostalgia continues to draw us to the box office\\, their makers have silently gutted the original archetypes and contents and replaced them for quick\\, repeated\\, extremely transparent swipes at all carriers of a Y-chromosome\\, as well as a new meaningless\\, incoherent portrayal of The Force\\, which shows up when it likes\\, means whatever it wants\\, and escapes value or even conceptualization. totally trash!","true":true}
