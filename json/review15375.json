Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love all the June 13 reviews!!!! They're better than the best movie! Presidents and Sit Com characters love The Last Jedi! Disney hills boost the rating of this film. But this film wasn't good\\, and Disney has rationalized it by attacking a specific demographic segment\\, as if that somehow makes the film better.","true":true}
