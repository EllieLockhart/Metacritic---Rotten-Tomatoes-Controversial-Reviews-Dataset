Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was really\\, really good. Adam Driver was phenomenal as Kylo Ren. For those complaining that this movie disregarded or ignored all the fan theories stemming from The Force Awakens\\, and left the viewer with unanswered questions\\, I would just like to point out that you are literally complaining that your own predictions ended up being wrong.  This film was apparently too unpredictable for some. To those complaining that Rian Johnson ruined their childhood hero\\, Luke Skywalker\\, by turning him into a broken shell of a man\\, I would say\\, \\\"Did you not watch the movie?\\\" Clearly\\, Luke has regrets\\, but they were all validated by Yoda\\, and Luke ended up pulling off the most heroic\\, sacrificial\\, Jedi mastery ever depicted in the films\\, saving the rebellion once again! I had some gripes with the use of humor in some areas that I thought could have done without\\, but overall\\, I thoroughly enjoyed the film (particularly Adam Driver's portrayal of Kylo Ren)\\, and cannot fathom where all these negative reviews are coming from.","true":true}
