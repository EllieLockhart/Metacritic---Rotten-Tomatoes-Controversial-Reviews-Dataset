Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney when Mark H. (Luke Skywalker) says I disagree with everything his character is doing in this new movie you might want to listen. Disney thought who cares Star Wars people will see it. And there right we did go see it. What a disgrace. Now see how many people will go see your next movie. I definitely will not see it and tell others to do the same. I\u2019ll take episodes 1\\, 2\\, and 3 over these new ones! George Lucas please come back! By the way you may call these new movies Star Wars\\, but for me and true Star Wars fans there are only 6 Star Wars movies to date. I will not include the Disney movies. What a joke. Yes both of them!","true":true}
