Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a star wars fan I just can't make my mind up about this film. I want to hate it but can't find enough evidence. the throne room battle scene is enough to carry this film. today I'm ok with how they dealt with luke\\, tomorrow I probably won't be.  it'll take 10 DVD viewings to come to a conclusion.","true":true}
