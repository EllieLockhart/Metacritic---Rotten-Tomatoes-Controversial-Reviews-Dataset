Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was an Abomination... Simply put\\, if you grew up with the Original Trilogy and are a diehard Star Wars fan\\, you're going to despise this movie more than any of the prequels. If you aren't a bigtime Star Wars fan\\, you'll be entertained by the shiny lights. \\n\\nThere isn't a character that they didn't RUIN with this movie aside from Poe Dameron. The porgs are forced down your throat in seemingly every scene of the movie (in particular\\, a whole nest of these heinous monstrosities find their way on the Falcon...) Luke Skywalker is a complete WUSS in this movie (which ruins all of his character development)\\, logical fallacies throughout the ENTIRETY of the movie (why was their fire raining down on Rey and Kylo? How did that cruiser WARP THROUGH A 1ST ORDER SHIP? HOW DID THOSE JUNKY SHIPS AT THE END EVEN FLY?)\\n\\nThis movie isn't just bad... Give it a little while for the hype to die down\\, and I guarantee this will be the most hated movie in the whole franchise.","true":true}
