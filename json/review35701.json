Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a train wreck\\, done in by bad writing and worse editing. This movie clocks in at two and a half hours\\, but manages to squander most of that time on side stories and fails to properly focus on a single protagonist (is it Rey or Luke?).\\n\\nIt gleefully ignores the set up from The Force Awakens and makes dumb jokes\\, wasting any emotional capital the audience has invested.\\n\\nCheap shark-jumping abounds: Leia's single use of the force in any movie happens here and involves her reviving herself and Force-flying through space. A Yoda Force ghost appears and cracks jokes about ancient Jedi texts shortly after casting Force lightning (no explanation is given as to this ridiculous expansion of the universe).\\n\\nThere are some good moments\\, including a fight scene with Kylo Ren and Rey\\, but overall the movie is flat\\, poorly paced\\, and boring.","true":true}
