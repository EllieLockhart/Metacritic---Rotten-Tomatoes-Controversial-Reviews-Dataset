Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie had much potential. It has some cool moments\\, but which are ruined some moments later. I had to cringe at some parts too\\, especially in the moments with Poe or Rey.","true":true}
