Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Take the super-negative reviews from some super-fans with a grain of salt. They're out of control! Last Jedi is incredibly challenging to me as a Star Wars fan. Yet it succeeds. Not simply because it challenges expectaions - that's not reason enough to recommend a movie. It succeeds because it's genuinely good...AND challenges expectations. I was surprised and moved. I really respect and enjoyed what they did. It made me like the prequels and the OT even more. Yes there are flaws. They are outweighed by the good. See it. Then see it again.","true":true}
