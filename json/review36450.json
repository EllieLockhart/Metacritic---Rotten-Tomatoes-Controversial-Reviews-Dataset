Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The most original\\, best acted\\, and best scripted Star Wars yet.  Rian Johnson has outdone himself. I'm not sure what audiences are thinking well the low scores-either fan boys who can't handle anything new and just want to rehash the \\\"cannon\\\"\\, or something funny is going on with paid posters or something. It's amazing-just sit back and enjoy.","true":true}
