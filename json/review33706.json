Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie. I didn't think it would be worse than Eps. 1\\, 2 and 3 but it pulled it off. Basically they're just going to make a political statement about bashing the 1%\\, burning down history\\, killing your parents\\, and \\\"feminism\\\" while either making our beloved characters into jokes (Leia is now Super Zombie Mary Poppins\\, Chewbacca is apparently now a vegan\\, and Luke is a hobo emo crybaby) or just killing them off. The characters that MADE Star Wars have been reduced to a modern day broken family of an immature deadbeat dad\\, and weak\\, enabling mother\\, that raised an egomaniacal serial killer and the crazy uncle that lives in a trailer in the middle of nowhere that talks to himself and rants about space junk and is probably banned from being within 300 yards of children.\\nThe \\\"comedy\\\" is cheesy and not Star Wars\\, the story was written for the modern-day brain dead movie goer that would rather have no storyline but plenty of pointless\\, stupid\\, mind numbing action and explosions with political turds thrown in for good measure. They don't even bother giving us a good character to try and connect with after they finish killing off the great ones. The silly Messiah character Rey\\, whose \\\"eyes have been seen before\\,\\\" practically a female Anakin prodigy\\, while having that Skywalker mechanical prowess to boot\\, is apparently just a thrown away nobody orphan. Why? So they can skip the awkward Leia\/Luke kiss and set up a romantic connection with Kylo\\, who by now has been turned into a character with zero lasting value except for looking forward to his death? The ONLY child of Han and Leia the ONLY kin to Luke (who was apparently an abstinate hobo) and they turn him into a d-bag temper tantrum throwing mass murderer. He can slice his daddy up but chokes killing his mommy... Whole family gone to hell\\, and Jerry Springer isn't there to give us a better show than this used diaper.\\nThe tone of this movie was \\\"Kill Myself.\\\" The movie kills Star Wars and the true fans see it.","true":true}
