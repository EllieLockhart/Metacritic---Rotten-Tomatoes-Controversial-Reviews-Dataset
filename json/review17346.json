Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I remember seeing The Empire Strikes Back for the first time and feeling devastated when Darth Vader told Luke that he was his father. And then seeing Luke successfully bringing out the good in him in The Return of the Jedi was such an emotional experience. The Force Awakens was good because it introduced new characters and gave praise to the originals. But The Last Jedi destroyed all of that. The struggle between good and evil that was so prominent in the original movies\\, so far\\, is missing in the new trilogy. Even more so in this latest installment. Not only do you see a Star Wars movie for the space battles but also for the light saber scenes. Why were they so boring in this movie? And the story? Character development? This was definitely not a Star Wars movie. You've failed your highness...","true":true}
