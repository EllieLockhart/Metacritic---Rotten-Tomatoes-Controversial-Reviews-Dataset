Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie had amazing cinematography with a fabulous story line. Everything is completely original and leaves you wondering what will happen next. Acting was amaxing\\,.only.one scene that I thought was a little odd with Leia. Definitely worth seeing!","true":true}
