Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Trying too hard to make something different with zero substance.  Horrible character growth\\, cheap jokes that serve no purpose to the story (Luke drinking monster milk).  Pointless side stories(casino planet)\\,  pointless characters(phasma) and uncharacteristic actions by characters we have seen grow(Luke).  Excellent special effects and sound\\, unfortunately could not save this Titanic(as in sinking ship) of a movie.","true":true}
