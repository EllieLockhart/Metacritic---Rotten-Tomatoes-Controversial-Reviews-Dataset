Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bad writing\\, typical action movie nonsense\\, some bad acting\\, and lots of holes. I couldn't help but derive some enjoyment due to it being star wars\\, but for me that was all it had going for it.","true":true}
