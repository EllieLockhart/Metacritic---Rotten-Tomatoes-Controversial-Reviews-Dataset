Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing film. I am usually in agreement with the critics but I left this film shocked and confused. Did the critics see a completely different film? Bad writing\\, bad storytelling\\, bad jokes\\, plot holes. I have not cringed so much in a film since watching Spider-Man 3. I know it's \\\"just a film\\\" but I am passionate about movies and had high expectations for this movie. This film isn't \\\"different\\,\\\" it's just bad. Rogue One was different and it was great. This movie felt like a generic blockbuster that could possibly be enjoyed by those who are easily entertained. There is so much wrong with this film but I am not going sit here typing it all out as many others have already done that. I will\\, however\\, give this film one star because of the strong acting from Mark Hamill\\, Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver. Also\\, the porgs are very cute\\, Crait was a cool planet (too bad it was underused) and the crystal fox creatures are adorable. I also enjoyed Rey's scenes with Kylo Ren. Those are the only positive things I can say about this film. It really is a disappointment.","true":true}
