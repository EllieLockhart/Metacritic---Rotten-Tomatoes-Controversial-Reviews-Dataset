Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing this a second time I have changed my mind on this movie. At first I was upset and mad at the direction of the characters. I still do not like the flying Leia scene but getting past that there are very enjoyable scenes in this movie. Im glad the movie was not predictable.","true":true}
