{"101487":148236,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just because it's surprising\\, doesn't mean it's good. Okay movie\\, had some awsome scenes and moments and good messages\\, but was totally out of place with TFA and the whole Star Wars sega\\, it seemed like Johnson went on the internet and looked up all the fan theories and checked them off his list\\, \\\"So I can't do this or this\\, man...i really wanted her to be a Kenobi\\, whatever\\, got to surprise the audience!\\\"\\, seems like the point of the movie was just to surprise the audience instead of giving them a good and fresh story\\, because there is so much more to the Star Wars universe than a fleet chasing a ship\\, a casino and a small island! Also\\, total disrespect to Luke\\, Mark Hamill even said he didn't agree with the way his character was going\\, totally agree. It seemed like the director and Disney thought of Luke as a burden and thought he chocked the other character developement. If that was really so\\, why dedicate the whole movie to Luke. As if they wanted to make him bad\\, that we would be satisfied he is gone. The character developement\\, there almost was none. Ray was stuck following grumpy Luke\\, learning three lessons that honestly anyone knew\\, did some soul searching\\, but eventually the only thing that really changes her is the realization that her parents were nobodies\\, altough the movie hints she already knew that and it was more the waiting for them to come back that bothered her. She believing there was  still good in Kylo Ren and wanting to fight for that was good\\, but also just like Luke. Poe was definitely the star\\, loved the way he matured\\, learning that it wasn't the goal isn't beating the bad guys\\, but helping and unifiying the good guys. Many unnecessary subplots(Leia floating through space?Rose and Finn)\\, characters(Benicio del Toro\\, Phasma\\, Snoke\\, R2D2...)\\, plot holes(Lightspeed crashing\\, really?Being the only ones fighting the First Order\\, no one answering their call for help\\, Luke's blue lightsaber?Luke astral projection?Luke who knowing and experiencing all the bad things his dad\\, SITH LORD Darth Vader did\\, sacrificed his life to save him because he saw good in him\\, even redeemed Anakin Skywalker\\, but suddenly\\, the minute he senses the bad in Ben Solo\\, his nephew and student\\, wants to murder him in his sleep???The whole build-up of Snoke\\, his extreme Force powers\\, rise to supreme leader\\, scars\\, conection to the Skywalker family\\, corrupting of Ben Solo\\, just to see him cut in half and no questions answered?The whole Phasma and Finn rivalry nonsense?). Yes\\, there was good and no\\, it wasn't terrible\\, but could've and should've been better. Definitely not their best decision and definitely not the best Star Wars film.","true":true}
