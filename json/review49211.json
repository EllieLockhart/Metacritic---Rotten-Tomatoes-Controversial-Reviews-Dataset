Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie. Everyone in this movie is either stupid or an ass. The only good sene is the throne room sene but then you realize how bad the fight choreography for the guards is.","true":true}
