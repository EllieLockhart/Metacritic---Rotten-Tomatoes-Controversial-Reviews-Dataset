Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the resurrection of Star Wars comes to a screeching halt. It resembled Space Balls more than anything else.  The dated humor and lack of any depth left me with a strong sense of disgust. The addition on Rose dilutes the film even more. Her stale sarcasm screams of utter childish indulgence.  Moreover\\, it begs the question..... why did they need to introduce a new character? Actually why even ask questions. This movie should have just never happened.","true":true}
