{"101487":181040,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is dissaster for the Star Wars brand which I am big fan of. Partyl stolen BS Gallactica\\, partyl copied original movies (really?)\\, totaly stupid dialoges\\, absurd plot (who the hell was the main evil guy that died so stupidly\\, why is Skywalker retarded\\, when he was one hell of a character\\, why the f*ck do he die\\, etc. )... How can you say that war just started when no ally answers your calls and you are left with only few transport ships :DDDD.. If all that is left of rebellion is 30 people.. no commnet.\\n\\nWhy is some stupid woman staying on the bridge saying she has to stay\\, when she walks there doing absolutely nothing\\, just watching  transporters die.. Even with the original plan\\, she wants to suicide\\, so why not the fuck turn it around and pretend all the rebels suicided to kill the main bad guy. Its so freaking stupid movie\\, that it beats even episode VII which I and my friends thought could never be beaten. \\n\\nJoda back? Why now\\, what the fuck? The evil pit under the island? Just stupid empty mirror? WTF? Random girl learning all the jedi powers\\, tricks\\, lightsaber stuff with abs no training? Why is it still only copy of previous episodes with differents characters?\\nThis is so freaking bad it makes me wanna hang myself :D \\n\\nThe only positive rating goes for the penguin like creatures that annoy the hell out of chewie (another pointless character there)\\, island joke with the falling stone  and poetic ending of random Harry potter controlling broom with his will gazing at the stars. \\n\\nPS I still feel like it was just mixture of Harry Potter and BSG.. \\nSo dissapointed that I write my first movie review ever\\, because normally I don't give a damn. \\n\\nSorry to say this\\, but even The Room is better movie than this","true":true}
