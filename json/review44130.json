Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To be fair\\, all Star Wars movies are riddled with plot holes\\, physics failures\\, and the occasional bad joke. That being said\\, almost all of them (especially the ones on this side of the decade) have compensated these minor flaws by making the movies so enjoyable to watch. Unfortunately\\, that trend ended with the Last Jedi. The excessive plot holes and complete disregard for science was painful\\, the character's motives were weak and unimaginative\\, the script was lazy and rushed\\, the attempts at humor were botched\\, and as a result\\, the few enjoyable moments that were present in the film were quickly trampled on and forgotten. Thoroughly disappointing to say the least. Here's to hoping JJ can save the trilogy with the third film!","true":true}
