Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow this movie is being panned hard by some p'd off fans\\, but honestly it was a gooder and if you're one of the tiny handful of people who aren't going to watch the movie because it's StarWars so of course you must\\, then please ignore the fans panning it and give it a shot.  It is really quite good.  \\n\\nSure bitter old Luke was a weird direction to go with that character.  Sure the whole plot on the Casino planet was pretty random\\, and the entire subplot that swings around it winds up being a bit of a lame duck.  Yeah the big reveals expected by fans after ep 7 were exactly the opposite of what people were hoping for in may ways.  But you know what?  After giving it some thought I realized that this was almost certainly the entire point.\\n\\nThis movie did not \\\"Destroy\\\" Star Wars.  What it did was destroy the idea that Star Wars is doomed to be an endlessly recurring series of now-iconic tropes designed to put money in the Mouse's pockets.  This was a Star Wars movie that forced me\\, a true\\, dyed-in-the-wool Star Wars nerd boy\\, to sit back and say \\\"well crap\\, I didn't see any of that coming.\\\"\\n\\nThe heroes ran about being heroic\\, but didn't prevail in the usual \\\"sneak aboard the big bad ship\\, do the thing\\, save the day.\\\"  They fumbled it instead.  Luke didn't turn out to be just the Yoda of the new series\\, but rather just a human saddled with the mantle of legend.  The endearing new Lando turned out to be a rogue decidedly absent a secret heart of gold.  The heroine is not a creature of prophecy or destiny.  The villain was no one you knew.  The great redemption of the goodish bad guy was not so redeeming.  The flashy action hero rushing out to save the day in a \\\"damn the torpedoes\\, and your orders\\\" kind of way learned that that is not a way to win wars.  After a while\\, the litany of broken tropes became pretty damn delightful.  An old hand like me was actually SURPRISED by a Star Wars movie!  Never saw that coming.    \\n\\nFor those of you so pissed by this movie you're demanding the director be hung from the highest branch\\, I'd point you in the direction of Star Wars: Rebels.  A great cartoon full to the brim of the satisfying\\, much-loved classic stories and scenes that fulfill all your day to day StarWars fandom needs.  This movie is not for that.  \\n\\nOh\\, and yes\\, it's full of big weird gaping plot holes and crud that makes no sense\\, even internally to it's fantasy setting.  So was the last movie.  And all the other ones for that matter.  If you're complaining about plot holes in a Star Wars movie\\, you have come to the wrong franchise.  \\n\\nAnd one last thing...  OF COURSE LEIA CAN BLOODY USE THE FORCE TO FLY AND SURVIVE IN SPACE!  She's as powerful a force user as has ever lived\\, she had like thirty years to practice with her Jedi Master brother\\, and it's been shown many times through the Extended Universe that the force can do powerful things at an instinctual level.  It was fine.  Get over it.","true":true}
