Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney made it clear pretty soon that this movie was all about women.\\nIt is really in your face. They did not even try to hide it.\\nLook at that giant bleeding vagina in the poster\\, complete with clitoris hooded Luke. \\nIt is\\, literally\\, a \\\"free bleeding feminism\\\" manifesto. Google it. That movement is real.\\nThe cannon aimed at the gate from which red rivulets emanate\\, is an all too clear metaphor of male sexual violence against women.\\nKylo Ren appearing shirtless to Rey was a clear attempt to hint at him sexually harassing her. Her reaction is very revealing.\\nIt's not a joke. They used the STAR WARS appeal to lure people (especially males) into the theaters in order to lecture them about female supremacy\\, male ineptitude\\, evil nature and violent attitude toward women.\\n\\nThe real title of this movie is Star Wars - #MeToo","true":true}
