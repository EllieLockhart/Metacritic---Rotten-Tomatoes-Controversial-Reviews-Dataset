Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is really too much to say that is wrong including the fact that they changed the philosophy behind the force and all sorts of things. The First Order is not scary... it's laughable and led by idiots. The opening scene lost me. But ultimately it felt more like a bad Star Trek spin-off than Star Wars. Rian Johnson admitted that he has never read any of the broader Star Wars lore and it showed. It simply wasn't Star Wars.","true":true}
