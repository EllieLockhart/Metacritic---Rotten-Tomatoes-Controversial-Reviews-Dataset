Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie made me extremely sad. Star wars is a a saga that has built up a unique and interesting universe over the last decades and it was all destroyed in this movie. The story made no sense\\, characters were idiotic and uninteresting\\, and the decisions made in this film completely destroyed pre existing possible plot lines set by previous films. The actors\/actresses in this film are not at fault\\, only the people in charge of directing this movie. They made a movie that was disappointing and made no sense rather than a movie that would be in people's memories for a long long time. I will not watch any future films nor will i purchase any further merchandise thanks to this movie. DO NOT WATCH.","true":true}
