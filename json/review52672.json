Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All style with no substance. A visually beautiful movie that lacks story and any continuity with the Star Wars Universe. I walked out of the theatre not overly happy\\, but not overly upset either\\, just \\\"meh\\\". Upon reflection though\\, this movie will make any fan (not Fanboy) of Star Wars furious. The \\\"Disney-fication\\\" of this universe is so apparent and off-putting\\, I really don't know where they can go from here.","true":true}
