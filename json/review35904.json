Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is the worst Star Wars film\\, mainly because Rian Johnson dumped all the story threads setup in The Force Awakens and ignores the Original Trilogy character motivations. Mainly his treatment of Luke Skywalker is soooo out of character. His explanation of the fall of the new Jedi Order is rushed and so jarring with what people know of Luke from before. Dumb!\\nAnd the Rey back story has now totally made her a Mary Sue\/Gary Stu as in two films she's not really progressed as a character or earnt any of the skills she uses. She just does everything and everyone likes her. Virtually the definition of this type of story writing that's normally confined to fan fiction.\\nAs a life long Star Wars fan this movie has destroyed this trilogy\\, and casts a shadow of doom across the previous trilogies. Meaning for many we'll have to ignore these new films and pretend they never happened. Which surely is the opposite of what Disney would want? Gain a few new fans\\, but lose masses of their old fans. Even those that stick with the franchise after Jar Jar Binks!","true":true}
