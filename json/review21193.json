Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I watched is last night and the negative reviews are all correct. I watched a strip down version on a stream and without the visual effects it is extremely lazy story telling.  I just can't understand how Disney could let this be released with all the competition such as Game of Thrones\\, Stranger Things and Walking Dead being such amazing storytelling. This movie is so lazy that 80% of the scenes are recycled from the 3 original movies.","true":true}
