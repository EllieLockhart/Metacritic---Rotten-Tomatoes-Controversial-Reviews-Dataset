Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie gets half a star for looking gorgeous but minus 4.5 stars for screwing up the all time greatest hero of the galaxy.  The legend of luke skywalker was trashed \/ shit on by this movie.  We waited years to have Skywalker return and this movie shit all over our expectations.  If you love Star Wars\\, pass on Sequel trilogy as Star Wars ended properly with 1 thru 6.","true":true}
