Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So upset to say this. I love star wars\\, i have for nearly 30 years. I love everything in the extended universe every movie\\, video game and book.(including movies 1-7)\\n\\nThis movie was GARBAGE for so many reasons I can not express in this short review. Ryan and Kathleen should be embarrassed. ","true":true}
