{"101487":149377,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-07","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Last Jedi's shortcomings are too numerous to remember...\\n\\n- Its awkward\\, self-aware humour. \\n\\n- Its shambolic narrative structure (including a superfluous subplot on a casino planet that goes nowhere and achieves nothing).\\n \\n- Its bizarre portrayal of classic characters (Leia Poppins... Luke the teet-milking\\, petulant preteen... the man who redeemed Darth Vader\\, contemplating murdering his nephew in his sleep for thinking bad thoughts). \\n\\n- All the questions it disregards: Who the hell was Snoke? How was he killed so easily? How did he turn Kylo Ren? Who were the 'Knights of Ren'?' How did Maz Katana get Luke's (and Anakin's) lightsaber from Bespin? \\n\\nIf you want to see an actual heroic film that is moving and deep\\, watch \\\"Darkest Hour\\\" instead. Now THAT is good storytelling... and its true!","true":true}
