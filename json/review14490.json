Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hated this movie. It has ruined the Star Wars saga. For me its non canon. The writer and director should be force choked\\, diced with a lightsabers\\, fried with force lightning and fed to the original trilogy Rancor. Okay maybe that's a little extreme but in all seriousness this movie was horrible. The actors did great the fault lies in the story. The character of Luke Skywalker was done a horrible injustice. There was no proper light saber duel\\, we were given expectations (Rey's heritage) that were total let downs\\, Admiral Akbar was casually killed off (upstaged by a pink purple monstrosity-- thank the Force that character is dead so I won't have to see her again) Snoke was killed off without ever revealing who he was\\, Finn should have had much better character growth from the previous movie\\, Lando should have been in the movie (maybe Finn's father?) a long section of the movie dragged\\, and last but not least in a real Star Wars story there is no problem that can't be solved by jumping in an X-Wing and blowing things up!","true":true}
