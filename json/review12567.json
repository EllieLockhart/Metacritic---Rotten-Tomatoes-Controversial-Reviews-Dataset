Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't believe what Disney and Rian Johnson have done\\, they have destroyed the best movie franchise of all time in 2 1\/2 hours. Even the prequels were better than this crap\\, hands down. Do not waste your time and money supporting this trash.  So angry and disappointed\\, I hate what these idiots have done to such a great franchise. The overrated idiot Johnson gave us all true fans a huge middle finger\\, and I hope he and all the Disney execs rot in hell for destroying such a beloved\\, storied franchise. So disgusted.","true":true}
