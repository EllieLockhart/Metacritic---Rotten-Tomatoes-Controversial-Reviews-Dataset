Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible film\\, extremely boring and alot of stupid jokes that don't hit the mark\\, you just don't care about all these new characters because they're all so bland. It's like Disney has managed to hypnotise people into thinking that these new star wars films are good or even watchable. They have dumbed down Star Wars to appeal to the mass market and it has obviously worked with the amount of people going to see this film\\, it's a real shame.","true":true}
