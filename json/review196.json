As aEqual parts soap opera drama and absurd craziness\\, Yakuza 0 is a terrific entry point into the long running and very popular Japanese underworld drama. As a starting point for the two main lead characters of the series\\, Kazama Kiryu and Goro Majima\\, it shows what lead up to the first game and the causes for how they became the people they were at the very beginning of the main story. As a newcomer to the series\\, it was nice to see the characters in almost their base form and see what drove them towards the events that will happen in the first game.\rFor those that don't know and might be interested in this series\\, the Yakuza series is filled to the brim with everything that's over-the-top. Whether it's the story\\, the combat\\, or the crazy weird side quests\\, this game throws everything and the kitchen sink at you. Starting with the story\\, as stated before\\, this is a great starting point for the series and for people to get into it. It hits on alot of stuff that seems like it will carry over to the following games. While the entire game is in Japanese\\, you can tell that the actors they got for this are top notch. Especially those who played the main two leads\\, Kiryu and Majima. And while the story goes deep into soap opera territory\\, especially and most notably towards the end\\, it's still a very good story. Set along side a wonderful soundtrack that beautifully captured the main events perfectly\\, the overall cinematic feel that basically everything in this game has really sets it apart from other games.\rThe combat is where things get a little dicey for me. I've heard it compared to old school beat-em-ups like Streets of Rage. I'm personally not a huge fan of the system. You seemingly just point your character towards an enemy and mash buttons till they are dead. There really aren't very many combos and the game relies too heavily on counters as trying to set them up is extremely difficult because the lock on system is not very well done and far too loose when trying to lock onto one enemy in a large group of them. It could use a little more refining going forward.\rWith so much to do and see in the game\\, it's hard to pass up on this. I had to take a point away because of the messy combat system and the soap opera-y tone the story took on late. But I'd highly recommend this to anyone who wants to get in on the ground level. Especially with the upcoming release\\, and proper\\, remake of the original game due to come out in a month or so.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
