Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This may have surpassed Empire Strikes Back as the best of the saga.  OUr new Hero finds her way\\, as Kylo Ren descends fully into darkness.  Luke struggles with his own demons and learns as much as he teaches.  There is a full range of emotion in this chapter\\, I laughed\\, and cheered\\, and I cried - and not just over Carrie.  An absolutely incredible Star Wars experience.  I cannot wait to see the final chapter.","true":true}
