Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My wife and I loved this movie\\, and had to read many articles to figure out why others didn\u2019t. This is a great movie if you come to it without expectations of what should happen. They tell an amazing story as long as you are open to it\\, and aren\u2019t wanting your favorite fan theories to be confirmed. ","true":true}
