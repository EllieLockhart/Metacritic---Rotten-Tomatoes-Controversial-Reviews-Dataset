Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It driven the story foreward atleast\\, to many people die just to introduce the movies to a \\\"new generation\\\" and have a clean start. It felt now more like a kids disney movie with cuddly big eyes pets all over almost saying \\\"i am groot\\\" and suffers from the same flat jokes than part 1 - 3 did. \\n\\nThe most amazing thing tough is that\\, despite hightly developed AI and Androids they are STILL not able to invent Crouise Controll so everytime one heroic guy dies leaving himself behind to fly the ship straight foreward from the enemy while the others escape.","true":true}
