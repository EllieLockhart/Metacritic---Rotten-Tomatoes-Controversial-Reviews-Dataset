{"101487":96854,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-24","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"1.  Didn't finish plot lines open from TFA. \\n    -  TFA made Rey's parents a major storyline. Unsatisfactory\\, explanation in the last Jedi\\n    -  Why is Rey is such a strong user of the force?  TFA is guilty of this as well. How can someone who has never had training able to wield a light saber so proficiently she is able to defeat Kylo Ren\\, a character who is made out to be the next Vader. \\n2.  Comedy felt forced\\, cheesey\\, and out of place. \\n    -  dialogue between Poe and Huck\\, eliminated the tension in the beginning\\n    -  Luke milking the space creature\\n    -  ....\\n3.  Story of Luke doesn't logically follow the character in the original trilingual \\n     -  I don't buy that Luke would kill his nephew after sensing an \\\"inkling\\\" if the dark side. Keep in mind that the original Luke spent the entire original series trying to bring back his father from the dark side. \\n4.  The space chase\\, tactically did not make sense. \\n    -  why didn't first order send a few of their ships to hyperspace ahead of the rebels and cut them off?\\n5.   The purple haired lady withholding her overall plan from her subordinates didn't make sense. If she hold disclosed her plan\\, the whole casino side quest would've been unnecessary. \\n6.  There's too much wrong with this movie for me to list. \\n7.  The only positive was that it was beautiful visually. The hyperspace ramming scene was cool. The fight between ray and Kylo against the elite Garda was well choreographed\\, if unbelievable (still not sure how Rey became one of the proficient users in such a short amount of time). \\nI really wanted to like this movie. There's just too much wrong just from a story telling perspective. Cheesey and forced comedy; unexplained \/ unsatisfactory resolution of plots from the TFA; the injustice to Luke; unebelievable plots( even for science fiction); unnecessary plot lines(casino); \\nI'm not giving away my money to see the last installment in theaters\\,  I'll wait to rent on Prime or Netflix.","true":true}
