Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Actual trash\\, makes no sense if you watch the rest of the movies\\, is only good if you are some random guy who has never watched a star wars movie\\, no wonder this is the worst rated star wars movie.","true":true}
