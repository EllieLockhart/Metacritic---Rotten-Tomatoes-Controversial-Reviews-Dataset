Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was the first Star Wars Movie I didn't want to see again immediately afterwards.  Just watched it on Netflix for the second time and my position has not changed.  It is almost as if Rian Johnsom either never saw the original films or wanted to piss core fan group off.  I have heard films aren't supposed to be made for fans.  If fans pay an outrageous ticket price for a stupid storyline that does not get them excited about future installments\\, then Disney leaves money on the table because core fans won't just show up because it is Star Wars.  \\n\\nDisney really needs to rethink the decision to allow each director to write their own films.  There is no way to satisfactorily save this story line in the next movie.","true":true}
