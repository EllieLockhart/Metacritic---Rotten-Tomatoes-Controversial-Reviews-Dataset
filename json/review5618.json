Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"didn't even feel like star wars\\, the first scene has ONE x-wing take out all of the defenses of a dreadnaught star destroyer... all down hill from there .. YIKES\\, gonna try really hard to delete this from my memory.","true":true}
