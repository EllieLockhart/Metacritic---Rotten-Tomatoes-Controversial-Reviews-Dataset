Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a huge Star Wars fan. But this film was altogether disappointing\\, they ruined my all time favorite character Luke\\, plot was all over the place\\, and too many unanswered questions(snoke). Do not waste your time on this movie\\, stick to the originals.","true":true}
