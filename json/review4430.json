Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Cenas grandiosas n\u00e3o fazem um bom filme\\\". Esta \u00e9 uma verdade que se aplica ao Os \u00daltimos Jedi. \u00c9 um filme que faz tudo errado: tenta dar o protagonismo ao novo\\, apagando o passado. O destino \u00e9 uma met\u00e1fora perfeita disso. O problema \u00e9 que essa estrat\u00e9gia \u00e9 burra. Sobretudo quando feito num filme repleto de furos no roteiro\\, sem coer\u00eancia\\, desenvolvimento de personagens e solu\u00e7\u00f5es ex-machinas a cada 15 minutos.","true":false}
