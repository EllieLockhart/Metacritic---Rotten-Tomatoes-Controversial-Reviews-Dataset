Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely terrible. Easily the worst Star Wars movie out of all of them\\, including the Holiday Special. You would think with the success of Rogue One that they would have learned a few things since TFA but evidently they did not. I definitely feel this was a waste of money.","true":true}
