Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"It really was a let down I was very excited to play this but in the 20 hours that it took me to beat it 16 of those hours was so boring it felt like doing the same mission over and over again but in a different location. And the direction they went with the story was so dumb and it made it so useless and boring I really didn\u2019t care what happened I just wanted to beat it\\, which I regretIt really was a let down I was very excited to play this but in the 20 hours that it took me to beat it 16 of those hours was so boring it felt like doing the same mission over and over again but in a different location. And the direction they went with the story was so dumb and it made it so useless and boring I really didn\u2019t care what happened I just wanted to beat it\\, which I regret because the ending was so unsatisfying\\, empty\\, and threw the whole journey to the trash.I didn\u2019t feel anything for the characters I hardly paid attention because I was in a rush to continue Ellie\u2019s story and was forced to play as a wwe super star for 10 hours!!! That part really put it in the grave for me it was almost unbearable but I somehow did it\\, I already have some friends that deleted the game after finding that out.If there is a 3rd installment I hope she wakes up and the whole thing was a nightmare because that\u2019s what The Last Of Us part 2 is. And what ever game ND is making next don\u2019t let Neil lead it i don\u2019t want another **** story.In conclusion don\u2019t buy this it\u2019s better if you just watch clips it\u2019s not worth your time it\u2019s better to forget this thing and move on I\u2019m really glad this wasn\u2019t a lunch title for the ps5.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
