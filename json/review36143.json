Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi was a refreshing take on the Star Wars franchise. The movie subverts all the expectations the audience had\\, it was nice not being able to predict what was going to happen but still adhering to the Star Wars tropes. However\\, this is in no way a perfect movie it did struggle with pacing inconsistency and the dialogue in some scenes was questionable.But this is a Star Wars movie so Shoddy dialog went hand in hand with the cool explosions.  People seem to place this franchise up on a pedestal\\, claiming the originals to be masterpieces but they were\\, in fact\\, a fun\\, family action movie\\, with silly dialog\\, fun characters\\, and lightsaber duels. The Last Jedi offers all this up and I think it delivers on all. I walked into the cinemas to see a Star Wars film and that is what I got.","true":true}
