Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie has great moments\\, which are absurdly butchered why those \\\"disney times\\\"  or \\\"puns\\\" that clearly are not intended other that to appeal kids. Older fans will find those a bit annoying. Despite that\\, the narrative is good and far better than the previous episode.","true":true}
