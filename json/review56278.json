{"101487":170352,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-23","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\, the second instalment in Disneys Star Wars Trilogy\\, sadly\\, falls flat on its face and doesn't put our heroes in any new situations to what they were in the last film. \\n\\nInstead\\, we get silly moments that don't make sense\\, (you know which ones I mean..). Forced unlikeable character(s)\\, meaningless side plots\\, editing issues\\, characters telling the audience information we already know\\,  a whole array of conveniences\/Mary Sues\\, past character arches being rewritten\\, cringe-worthy dialogue\/ scenes (Luke Milking). And still a somewhat\\, heavy use of putting familiar things we have seen or heard before from the original trilogy. Whilst at the same time\\, completely throwing out all the questions and theories set up from the last film. \\n\\n*Quick Spoiler* \\nAs well as this\\, with Luke dying and Han being killed off beforehand\\, God knows how they are gonna write out Leia. Due to the untimely passing of Carrie Fisher.  I hope they don't CGI her face on to someones else body like in Rogue One. \\n\\nBefore I move on to the positives\\, there is one issue I have with this film\\, it seems some \\\"real world\\\" political viewpoints are creeping their way in\\, which isn't really needed I believe. Due to this franchise being a fantasy space opera.\\n\\nHowever\\, there are some elements of the film that I thought worked well or I liked. Such as the visual effects and CGI being mindblowing\\, as well as the musical score\/sound design is on top of its game like always. Costume and Set piece were great\\, as well as Adam Drivers performance being the best yet!. The fact that (as of now) the protagonist isn't related to the Skywalker family. \\n Plus\\, \\\"Porgs\\\" ain't as annoying at all. However\\, apart from this\\, the film isn't the worthy sequel it should be.  \\n\\nOverall\\, I feel that with the failure of Rogue One and now this under Disney's belt it seems like this 4 billion dollar purchase of this franchise isn't what they thought it could be. Due to the franchise being what it is\\, there isn't much room to move. On one hand\\, people will complain if they play it too safe and keep it nostalgic and heavy with fan service. Whilst\\, on the other hand\\, People will also complain if it's too original and doesn't have things they remember. \\n\\n So in the end\\, It seems the Star Wars Universe isn't as big or as adaptable as they hoped for. I recommend you give this one a pass. And see what they have up there sleeve for the last instalment in this saga.","true":true}
