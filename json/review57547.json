Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was like Star Wars by your pretentious film student roommate who hates Star Wars.  There were some good bits\\, but by and large this entire movie was just one large sledgehammer of disappointment straight to the face for me\\, a huge Star Wars fan.  Mischaracterizations\\, missed opportunities\\, pointless characters\\, more problems with hyperdrive functioning at exactly the \\\"speed of plot\\\" instead of by any rational or reasonable measure...and also thanks\\, Rian Johnson\\, for letting me know that all of my heroes will fail me and life is pain.  Like we don't get enough of that in the real world.\\n\\nI guess the porgs were cute.  Ugh.  Call me when Chewbacca and R2 get more screen time.","true":true}
