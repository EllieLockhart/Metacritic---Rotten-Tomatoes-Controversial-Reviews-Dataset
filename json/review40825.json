Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie builds and builds and builds nearly the entire time\\, and then wraps up with a near perfect\\, beautifully poetic finale. Didn\u2019t care for some of the campy moments that these movies can\u2019t seem to live without. But they do bring a bit of lighthearted humor to an otherwise generally dark and serious movie. Overall a beautiful film. Low fan ratings are most likely due to a difference in the film vs. expectations. Don\u2019t listen to those hacks. See this movie. Then make plans to see it again!","true":true}
