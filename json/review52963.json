Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A pretty trainwreck. Terrible pacing (unnecessary subplot destroys any tension)\\, huge waste of creative capital\\, no character development\\, and so many 'gotcha!' moments that it's painful.\\n\\nCharacters literally hide their plan just to create synthetic movie tension.\\nThis movie doesn't set up an interesting third installment of a trilogy\\, it ruined the overarcing plot with by changing the director who got creative control.\\nIt's on Netflix\\, it's worth seeing but\\, I wouldn't watch it twice.","true":true}
