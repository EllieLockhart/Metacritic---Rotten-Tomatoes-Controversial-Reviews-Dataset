Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the best written and best acted Star Wars film since Empire and the Star Wars film that goes the farthest in asking it's audience to challenge itself. Driver and Hamill put in exceptional performances and the practical effects and Kurosawaesque visual style harken back to Star Wars' roots.","true":true}
