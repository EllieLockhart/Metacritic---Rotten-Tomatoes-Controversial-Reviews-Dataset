Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie's conflict\/resolution rollar coaster every five minute through out the painfully dragged out 2h30m+ film is enough to drive anyone to the point of begging for the credits to roll\\, but the unforgiving TLJ continues to disappoint with every tease at a dramatic ultimatum. If a main character had been killed off at least I would have some emotional attatchment to the film but even then they decided to unburden may expectations. Questions begat more questions. Existing characters are contradicting or untouchable and new characters are unnecessary and forgettable. If it were a film by any other name I would not be so harsh on my criticism but this was inexcusable disrespect to the franchise and characters that i have loved from childhood. Extremely disappointed in TLJ and hope Disney gets off the high horse and treats the franchise with respect in Episode 9.","true":true}
