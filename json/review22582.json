Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let the past die\\, kill it if you have to!\\n\\nThis was not only the words that Kylo Ren spoke to Rey\\, but also the words of Rian Johnson to a generation of Star Wars fans. This is not like any previous film in the saga and for that\\, makes something old and familiar feel new and fresh again. \\n\\nRian Johnson took risks and expanded on the mysticism of the force which was a huge gamble that paid off by clearing the slate for our new heros in Episode IX!\\n\\nAbrams has a difficult task ahead of him and doubt he will be able to eclipse the sheer brilliance of The Last Jedi!","true":true}
