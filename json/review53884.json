Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"HORRIBLE\\, HORRIBLE\\, HORRIBLE!!! I\u2019ve loved Star Wars since I was little....Rian Johnson has completely butchered the story and ruined it!! This movie is garbage and truly broke my heart as far as Star Wars goes. We go from an amazing plot and setup with TFA only to have every element completely forgotten. THE LAST JEDI IS NOT A STAR WARS MOVIE ITS A PEICE OF S***!! Johnson obviously knows nothing about the story of Star Wars or its characters. They should\u2019ve just stuck with J.J\\, no wonder they brought him back along with other writers who actually understand the story. I don\u2019t know how they are going to fix this pile of dung though! Also what an amazing disconnect we have between these obviously paid critics who love this crap movie and the general public. I can\u2019t believe I just gave a Star Wars movie half a star out of five. It should be no stars\\, but I have to respect Mark Hamill and the rest of the cast for their attempt in trying to salvage what could\u2019ve been amazing character performances.","true":true}
