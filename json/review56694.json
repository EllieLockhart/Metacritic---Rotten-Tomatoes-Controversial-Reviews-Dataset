Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The majority of this movie made me feel like I was watching the OJ car chase. With all of the amazingly creative minds at Disney\\, how in the world did anyone ever say\\, \\\"Hey\\, instead of Hux just blowing up the Resistance cruiser\\, let's just slowly chase them through space for 18 hours and wait for them to run out of gas\\,\\\"? That is the best you've got Disney?\\n\\nI would really like to give this film 1 star\\, but I am giving it 2 Stars for a couple of reasons: 1 - there are some amazing scenes (Poe taking out the surface cannons on the dreadnaught\\, Rey and Kylo's fight scene\\, and Luke's finale). The problem is that overall story arc was virtually non-existent. A few good scenes strung together without a good plot to tie them together is not a good film. 2 - This is not a sequel to The Force Awakens. There is very little that carried over from one to the other. I am giving the extra star with the hope that this film is setting up Episode IX to wrap everything up nicely in the end. The second star is a star of hope.\\n\\nAs an admitted fanboy\\, it pains me to not love a Star Wars movie. While there are some problems with the prequels\\, I still love them. This is by far the worst Star Wars movie of all time. It would have been better had Holdo had Al Cowlings pilot the cruiser at the end. I just hope that OJ was still on board when Holdo jumped to light speed.","true":true}
