The game mechanics are just like the first game with some additions to it. The story is phenomenal and gets you invested in it early on. The story is scary\\, frustrating\\, happy\\, exciting\\, and depressing. You'll feel all sorts of emotions through this game and that's exactly what Naughty Dog wanted\\, for you to feel the pain of the protagonist. They wanted you to want revenge\\, to be angry\\, and the reviews reflect that. They want you to see the grey in things\\, that not everything is black and white. The decisions made by characters in this game and real decisions any of us can make if pushed to the breaking point of loss and sadness. They made some BOLD moves in the story and I think they're excellent. I cried\\, it was hard to see this story play out.\r\rThe Last of Us 2 is now my favorite game of all time. I'm now on my third play through and I plan to keep going. The world is huge\\, the story is long\\, and there's lots to see along the way. Get this game and be ready to feel all sorts of emotions. It's worth it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
