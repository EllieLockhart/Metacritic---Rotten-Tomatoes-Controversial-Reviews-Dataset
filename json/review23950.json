Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Man I really wanted to like this movie. I even tried to convince myself my initial disappointment leaving the theater was unwarranted after a couple of days. Unfortunately there is simply no excuse for what they did to Luke\\, the entire middle part of the film\\, or the new \u201cprotagonist\u201d Rose who has the personality of a wet log. Please someone take this series away from Rian - he means well but is completely incompetent. ","true":true}
