Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"THE most disappointing Star Wars movie to date... So much hype and it failed on a dramatic scale! ...so disappointed\\n\\nIt goes to show just how exceptional Rogue One actually was!","true":true}
