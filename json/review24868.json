Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My favorite film so far. Been a fan for 25 years and it produces some of the most visually stunning scenes of any Star Wars movie. Daisy and Adam were fantastic as was much of the supporting cast.","true":true}
