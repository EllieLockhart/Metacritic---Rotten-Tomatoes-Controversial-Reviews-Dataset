Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film destroys and undoes much of what the original 3 films set out to do and dishonors the characters of the past immensely.  It is an affront to the genius story George Lucas created and it is a clear example of why\\, overall\\, Hollywood is struggling and suffering.  Weak character\\, weak writing\\, great special effects\\, and a moment here or there that illicits a bit of emotion from the viewer.  Not the life changing saga of deep characters you actually care about.  Could have been worse I guess.  Or I've gotten too old.","true":true}
