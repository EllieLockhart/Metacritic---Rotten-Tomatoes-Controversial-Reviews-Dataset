Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely the worst movie of the year! so many plot holes and dumb moments i cant believe this is a SW movie. And what he did to lukes character is unforgivable. what a way to kill all interest in the next movie. A lifelong SW fan heartbroken.","true":true}
