Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a Star Wars fanboy for most of my life and this movie surprised me in almost every way.   As much as The Force Awakens was A New Hope remake this took everything about Empire and did it differently. Every time I thought I knew what was going to happen they went a different direction.  I've read about some of the under tones of the movie but I didn't see them.  Go in with an open mind and this is one of the best Star Wars movies ever.","true":true}
