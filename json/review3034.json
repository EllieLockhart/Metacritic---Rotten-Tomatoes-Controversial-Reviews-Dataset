Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bad pacing\\, inconsistent characterization\\, writing that is obviously contrived for ~drama~ rather than anything else. I can see why Mark Hamill and Oscar Isaac didn't like this\\, and why Daisy Ridley doesn't want to play Rey after the trilogy's over. As a lifelong fan I feel let down and I don't think I'm going to watch the next one. :\/","true":true}
