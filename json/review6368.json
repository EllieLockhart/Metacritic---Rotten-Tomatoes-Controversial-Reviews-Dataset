Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney ruins a once great movie universe for money.\\n\\nSometimes breaking away from the old to make way for the new isn't the best path when those very same characters were responsible for making Star Wars so great.\\n\\nEpic fail\\, Disney.","true":true}
