Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm being generous by giving this a 2. For the special effects alone I raise this above a 1. Like many of us die hard star wars fans\\, I'm shocked how bad this is. I saw this in the theater last year. Now a year later I got to see it again on tv and if anything\\, its worse that my theater experience. Its all about the writing. This is what they came up with?","true":true}
