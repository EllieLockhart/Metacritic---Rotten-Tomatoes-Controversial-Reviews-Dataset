Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Complete and utter garbage. I have been an avid\\, almost RABID fan since '77. This is the end of the franchise for me. Utter garbage. If you're one of the guys who thought \\\"Wow\\, Star Wars would be a LOT cooler without Jedi and space magic\\,\\\" you'll love this movie. But if you're that guy\\, you're not a Star Wars fan anyway. Go watch Buck Rogers or Star Trek or literally ANY OTHER SCI-FI FRANCHISE without Jedi and enjoy that. I'd give it less than a half a star but I don't think it will let me.","true":true}
