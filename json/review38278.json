Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worat star wars movie.  Bored to rears.  None of the characters make sense.  What happened to all those cliffhanger questions from Force awakens.  Either got ignored or the answers were head scratchers.  As unsatisfyomg as a sequel could get do to boredom and stupidity.","true":true}
