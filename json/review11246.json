Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly my least favorite movie experience I've ever had. So disappointed in the pointless and unsatisfying story. A positive is that it is breathtakingly beatiful. Full of plot holes and thematic imconstistincies and my least favorite movie ever made ( not that it's objectivley the worst movie\\, I just personally hate it).","true":true}
