Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not Star Wars.  This is a vehicle for Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson to push a social agenda for those people they feel like need more representation in the Star Wars Universe.  This movie was supposed to be for young girls\\, lgbt\\, animal rights activists and vegans what Black Panther ended up being for Black people and it failed miserably.   The entire continuity of the franchise was wrecked by an attempt to drive the narrative in a \\\"whole new direction\\\".  And don't get me started on the lack of character development...Rey is one of the most poorly written sci fi characters in the history of cinema.  She's got all the cheat codes\\, a Super Mario star and God Mode activated.  I actually ended up rooting against her by the end of the movie.  Her character is a Mary Sue experiment gone horribly wrong and the lore was totally gutted to fit around her.  And Daisy Ridley's stiff acting doesn't help.  I could go on about Leia Poppins\\, Grumpy ol' Luke (RIP)\\, Canto Bight\\, Chewbacca the Flunky\\, the Yo Mamma joke\\, or the Purple Haired \\\"General\\\"\\, but I won't.  Until Disney rights the ship I will boycott any future Star Wars projects.  That's how terrible this movie is to me.","true":true}
