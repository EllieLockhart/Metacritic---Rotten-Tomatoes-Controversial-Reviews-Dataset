Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely horrible!! Disney pushing the PC casting and poor storyline has ruined Star Wars...i almost thought they it was Margaret Cho in the movie...there is no magic in this....only poor storyline with same old story \\\"oh we can turn him and make him good\\\" over and over and over...newsflash Disney that was already done with Darth Vaders storyline...find something new to write about..","true":true}
