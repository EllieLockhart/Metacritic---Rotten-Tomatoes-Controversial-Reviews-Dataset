Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm really shocked that this movie only got 59% on user critics. \\n1. You are not a true Star Wars fan if you did not enjoy this movie because it brought back a lot of the originality of the original Star Wars trilogy\\, which I found happily nostalgic. \\n2. This movie is filled with badass actors that really live up to the force of the Star Wars movies. (Pun intended). \\n3. Star Wars VIII: The Last Jedi exceeded my expectations. In a way\\, it is somewhat easily tied to Empire Strikes Back because of how situations are faced and how it leaves you in wonder. It is filled with  great one-on-one character interactions\\, punny jokes from time to time\\, and action-packed fight scenes that leave you thinking \\\"holy shit\\, did that just happen?\\\" Great movie. Loved it. Mind is blown because of its awesomeness. If you are a true Star Wars fan\\, you will really appreciate The Last Jedi.","true":true}
