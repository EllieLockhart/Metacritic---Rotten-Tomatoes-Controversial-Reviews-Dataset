Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"[Spoiler Alert] This movie forgot that it was a sequel to Force Awakens. You know all those open questions people have been debating for years? They are all ignored. And instead\\, a very long\\, uneventful story is given to us that doesn't really make sense\\, uses almost all actors as extras\\, and doesn't tell us anything. These is no story to this movie at all. Nothing happens. This is the worst star wars movie by far. It \\\"looks\\\" like a star wars movie but we literally learn nothing about the world in which this takes place. I'd rather watch Jar Jar Binks all day long\\, than watch this.","true":true}
