Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am not a fan fiction or extended universe junkie. And I didn't love the prequels\\, but they were tolerable.  They had some magic moments.  This movie had none.  As a stand-alone movie I could see how it could get a good review\\, but as a Star Wars movie\\, it is an epic fail.  I am not just saying that because it does not follow my preconceived notions of what should happen.  I am saying that because it is not consistent with the previous films.  Not even TFA.  I felt like Rian Johnson was giving the middle finger to all star wars fans on this one.","true":true}
