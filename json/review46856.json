Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well\\, this movie is not that bad\\, ok two halfs of the movie are just crap lets face it but the other half is actually preety good; I know that if two halfs of a movie are bad the whole movie must be bad\\,right? not at all\\, because when this movie fly it fly high","true":true}
