Its major flaw\\, and the reason I've not awarded it a 10\\, is the pacing\\, and how major events within the story are placed within the narrative. The game often feels bloated\\, and the urgency sometimes fluctuates as its characters root through draws and lockers for equipment\\, and without many real environmental puzzles\\, the game often goes through the motions until the next cutscene.\r\rThere are no heroes in TLOU2's bleak and relentlessly grim world\\, and the game frequently reminds you of this as you hack\\, dismember\\, and shoot your way through a stunning post-apocalyptic Seattle over the course of three days. Thankfully\\, there are reprieves: TLOU2 is scattered with beautiful flashbacks\\, which take you away from the endless violence and threat\\, and these moments are when Naughty Dog are able to bring life to its survivors. These flashbacks often tug on the heartstrings without any hint of over-sentimentality too. Aside from its main characters\\, whilst TLOU had compelling side-characters\\, aside from Dina\\, TLOU2 does not. This is not to say they are strictly unlikeable (bar Manny\\, a by-the-numbers womanizing Latino male stereotype)\\, but are not particularly memorable either. The game lacks a much needed nuance in some of its characterisations\\, but\\, to be fair to Naughty Dog\\, the game's treatment of Joel and Ellie's tumultuous\\, yet touching relationship remains the soul of the game\\, even if these moments are relatively fleeting.\r\rIf\\, as a player\\, you are emotionally invested in its themes of desperation\\, vengeance\\, guilt\\, and forgiveness\\, and most importantly\\, willing to play it with an open mind\\, the last few hours remain as gripping as any game released. Even gamers with no emotional investment in its story and characters should really find the game's visceral combat\\, its immersive world and breath-taking surroundings enough. It's undeniably a polarising game\\, but one thats story should be experienced for what it is\\, and not what it isn't.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
