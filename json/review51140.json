Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely HORRIBLE. Lets kill the last 40 years of what we know Star Wars to be. OH did I mention there is not even a single Light saber fight in the movie. It was HORRID.","true":true}
