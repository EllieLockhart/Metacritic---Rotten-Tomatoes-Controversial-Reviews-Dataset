Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Until now\\, Star Wars has used traditional\\, libertarian themes that nearly everyone agrees with. It's a story that relates how freedom is challenged by a misguided and corrupt government\\, allowing an evil dictator and empire to emerge\\, and how family\\, friendship\\, spirituality\\, love and defiance can win the day. If taken any further or used as commentary on the state of affairs in 2017\\, it will be divisive.\\n\\nUnfortunately\\, the Last Jedi is being used as a vehicle to promote an agenda that is contrary to the Star Wars founding. If nothing about this movie feels right\\, it's because every aspect is used to push the director's and the Disney head's political and social viewpoints\\, even if the movie goer is aligned with those views. George Lucas is right; the Last Jedi is beautifully made\\, but spectacle alone is not enough if the tone is entirely reversed. For now\\, Star Wars is out of balance.","true":true}
