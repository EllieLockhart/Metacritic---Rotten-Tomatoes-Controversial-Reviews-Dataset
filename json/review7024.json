Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*edit changed from 1\/2 star to 1 to avoid not being calculated in the score as I heard per rumor.\\n\\nTerribly disappointing movie. Many plot holes and completely out of touch with the fundamental foundations that made Star Wars beloved\\, The writer \/ directer selfishly forced down our throats his valued scenes at the expense of any cohesion\\, authenticity\\,or believability . Months after seeing this movie I am still painfully aware of how awful it was.","true":true}
