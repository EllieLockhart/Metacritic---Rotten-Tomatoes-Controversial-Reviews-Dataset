Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first and final acts are entertaining. The second act is a dumpster fire. Overall\\, the movie is very choppy and lacks a coherent focus. So much potential is simply wasted.","true":true}
