If you never played the first game you probably will give this game a solid review but based on playing the first game would say that some of the character choices didn't fit with how the first game ran. The story also show from the trailers that they where going in multiple directions with this game and left me feeling disjointed. I currently don't see myself buying a third game of the last of us part 3 if they have one only way I would buy a third game is if they did a prequel like red dead redemption 2 where they cover the life of Joel and tess and bill and Marlene and Tommy and Ellie mother covering the last 20 years even if it includes the comic.  If you have never played the fist one probably better to play part 2 first or else you probably won't feel to good about part to these are just my opinions so don't let my review stop you from buying or renting the game. Just did what you have to do.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
