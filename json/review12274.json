Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am not suprised\\, but i am dissapointed that so many viewers didn`t like the film. People who understand film do at the other hand agree that the film is fantastic. So why this diviation? Because the average film consumer are not used to devoloping a sophisticated reflection on music or film.","true":true}
