Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have a feeling the same fans who railed about The Force Awakens being too much of a nod towards and\/or redo of the original trilogy are the same fans who are so upset that The Last Jedi took some chances and moved the overall narrative into new directions...I loved this movie!","true":true}
