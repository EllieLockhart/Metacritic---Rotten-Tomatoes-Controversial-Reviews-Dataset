Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was such a great movie and to me one of the best in the franchise\\, people need to stop complaining about every new movie that comes out because it's not the originals. It's the sequels for a reason. TLJ handled the new characters well and the newest characters even better. The story was engaging and for the people saying it's an empire rip off are reaching so much. The comedy was handled well it was all funny and didn't feel forced. Everything about the movie was amazing. ****spoliers**** Yodas appearance was so unexpected and was handled amazing showing that even the old Jedi master knew how flawed the Jedi were. Through the movie we were lead to believe how weak Luke was only to see how powerful he actually is. Luke's death scene was beautiful with the twin suns showing his story coming full circle and also that he was sharing a moment with Leia with the twin suns and when he dies it only shows one sun. In my opinion this movie is the best they've ever done and better than Empire. It's sad that this movie is gonna be hated on because this fan base is the most toxic in the world. Lucasfilms could literally do nothing and the SW fans would shit on then for it. They give us what we ask for and for some it just isn't enough. Overall 10\/10.","true":true}
