Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is so much unjustified hate for this film. Some of the simpler fans can't handle the fresh new direction Johnston has taken. Don't forget that J J Abrams was the executive producer for TLJ\\, so anybody who said that Johnston \\\"ruined\\\" what J J set up are woefully uninformed. \\nTLJ is an amazing film that nobody could have predicted. Perfectly cast\\, amazing action\\, juicy plot.\\nThe Skywalkers had their era. These are new films with a new generation of characters to assume the mantle. People need to let go of the past heros and move on!\\nWill definitely watch again and again!","true":true}
