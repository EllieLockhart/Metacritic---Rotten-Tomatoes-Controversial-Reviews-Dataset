Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a  good movie if you think of it as it's own movie instead of as a Star Wars movie.  It has lots of action\\, beautiful visuals and is a decent sci-fi movie. Unfortunately\\, this movie really doesn't belong in the Star Wars world. It  didn't address the big questions from The Force Awakens and Rian Johnson did a terrible job when it comes to character development. At times\\, it seemed  like a Star Trek movie instead of a Star Wars movie. I now understand why Mark Hamill confronted Rian Johnson and said he fundamentally disagreed with everything in the script about Luke. Without spoiling anything\\, it upsets me as a Star Wars fan that the director didn't listen to Hamill's advice.  Rian made this HIS movie with HIS rules. I'm all for change and character development\\, but Johnson basically destroyed the Star Wars franchise as we know it.  I can't help but feel bad for JJ Abrams too...he has his work cut out for him when he directs the next movie. So\\, I am giving this movie two stars.  As a sci-fi movie\\, it is decent and deserves 2 stars. However\\, as a Star Wars movie\\, it earns zero stars because it just doesn't feel like a Star Wars movie. I wanted to like this movie\\, but Johnson missed the boat big time.  This is not the Star Wars movie you are looking for.","true":true}
