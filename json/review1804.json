Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a very intense Star Wars fan\\, I've taken a lot of time to process what Rian Johnson did with The Last Jedi since it was so shocking. The Last Jedi was the boldest Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back. However\\, unlike the beloved classic\\, the eighth episode of the Star Wars franchise misses too many marks to reach the same heights. Johnson's plot involving Kylo Ren\\, Luke\\, Snoke\\, and Rey is fantastic and feels like Star Wars while exploring new ground. It also makes The Force Awakens' retreading more forgivable since Luke's character very clearly addresses this theme of cycles with his cynicism. The Resistance plot more than anything is what drags this movie down as the fleet drags through space. The introduction of Rose seems very forced and there's very little tension to this subplot--just annoyance at the bickering between Holdo and Poe. Overall\\, the movie is not as bad as people will cry\\, but not quite as good as the critics want us to believe. Johnson did a pretty good job overall and while I'm not the biggest fan of everything in The Last Jedi\\, I still enjoy it.","true":true}
