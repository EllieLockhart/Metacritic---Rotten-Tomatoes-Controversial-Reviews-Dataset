Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had so much potential\\, but just crashed and burned. 2.5 hours where nothing happened. No questions about Ray or Snoke were answered\\, in fact\\, more questions arose. Luke acts out of character the entire movie. He constantly believes there is good in Vader\\, who kills hundreds of people\\, but tries killing his nephew in his sleep. Yep\\, makes sense. The Vise Admiral refuses to reveal her plan\\, for absolutely no reason. This results in a pointless plot point that involves a horrible\\, episode 1 type scene\\, with animals running through the streets of that casino town\\, and Poe trying to take over the ship. NONE OF IT MATTERED.  I REPEAT\\, ALL OF IT WAS POINTLESS. Yep\\, lets endanger and let most of our fleet get destroyed\\, let everyone lose hope\\, but not tell anyone our incredibly simple plan. Oh\\, also Luke projects himself\\, which is so exhausting it kills him\\, yet milking and drinking a random alien is ok....... WTF","true":true}
