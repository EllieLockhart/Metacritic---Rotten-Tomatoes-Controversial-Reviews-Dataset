Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was hands down and pants off the worst production that has ever had the Star Wars brand attached to it. \\n\\nOn the upside the actors worked their damnedest to salvage the script handed to them and it shows. The special FX is also in line with what you would expect of a modern day multi-million dollar production. \\n\\nBut that is where the praise ends. There are bewildering inconsistencies between this entry and The Force Awakens\\, a disastrous filler arc\\, near-zero character development\\, and plot holes so glaringly large that even the Death Star couldn't possibly erase them in a single lazer blast.\\n\\nAll in all this film insults your intelligence as a viewer with it's antics. I firmly believe the writers\\, as well as director Rian Johnson should consider a new line of work.","true":true}
