Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Utter disrespect towards the protagonists of the saga. How cand ou finish the story of Skywalkers with no Skywalker alive? Leia will not be on Episode IX according to Kennedy and Luke is dead. Luke was the one supposed to make it to the end. Of course they would kill him\\, but it made sense later\\, not now. Good luck to JJ working with what Rian left. On the bright side\\, unpredictable\\, but so much so that they did not mind if they unpredicatbility bordered on the ridiculous. Many plotholes. Does not leave much of an intrigue for the next episode.","true":true}
