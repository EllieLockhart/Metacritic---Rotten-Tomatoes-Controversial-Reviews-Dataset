Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When I left the theater\\, I felt that this movie was a passable continuation of the sequel-ogy. It wasn't satisfying\\, as too much of the movie tried to grow the side characters and bungling the effort. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley's acting and character arcs are the only upsides to this movie.\\n\\nWith some more time to mull on the ramifications of TLJ\\, I'd have to conclude that not only did I disliked it\\, but that it's also a bad movie. It undermines the work spent in the original trilogy and Force Awakens on characterization\\, in-universe consistencies\\, and overall tone. It's also unnecessarily long\\, spending far too much time setting up silly situations for character development when that could have been better done in more succinct ways. Much of the character development in A New Hope\\, for instance\\, occurred on the Death Star itself. If instead Han and the original gang needed to have their characters developed by searching for a mcguffin on Tattoine\\, that would have been wholly removed from the clear and present danger of the plot. Similarly\\, the entire Canto Bight subplot could've occurred on the pursuing ship with no loss in meaning while gaining cohesion to the larger plot. Overall\\, this movie is irreverent to a fault\\, and is precisely the kind of movie I dreaded from the person who wrote and directed the hot mess that was Looper.","true":true}
