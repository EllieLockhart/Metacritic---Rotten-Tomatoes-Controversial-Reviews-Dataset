Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had heard mixed things going into this film\\, even from friends of mine who tend to be much less critical of movies than I am. I liked Force Awakens enough to be somewhat hopeful for this movie. What I found is that basically\\, all of the elements I liked about Force Awakens were toned down\\, and the elements I didn't enjoy were turned up to full blast. \\n\\nThis film suffers from Revenge of the Sith's tonal issues\\, being an unfriendly mixture of extreme drama and violence as well as poorly implemented attempts at humor. I often found myself laughing in spite of the movie\\, incredulous at times when I was thrown for a loop by how ridiculous or ham-handed the story or storytelling had become. It's obvious that this movie was crafted to heavily appeal to a new generation of fans\\, but Millennial humor and Star Wars are a poor mix.\\n\\nThe film does handle its more dramatic elements quite well and there are some strong performances that help you care just a bit more about the plot and the characters. But for every great scene or powerful performance\\, there are ten times as many cringe inducing jokes\\, motivational speeches\\, CGI monsters\\, rehashed scenes\\, and stolen elements from past films.\\n\\nIt's not far-fetched\\, perhaps it's even necessary to say that this film is on par with the prequels in many ways. This film all but erases any mystery that was established by its predecessor. It's a bold statement about the bold new direction being taken by Star Wars.","true":true}
