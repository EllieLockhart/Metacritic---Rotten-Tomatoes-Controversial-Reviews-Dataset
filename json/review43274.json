Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a disappointing movie at best. The story made no sense. The humor was forced. And the characters that we have grown to love and know are not themselves at all. There were whole segments without any points to them at all. The way they showed force strength in some individuals was very unrealistic with what we know the Jedi powers to be in every movie\\, comic\\, and book ever. Overall this movie is the greatest disappointment of our lives.","true":true}
