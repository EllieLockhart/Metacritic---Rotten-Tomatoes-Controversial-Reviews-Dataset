Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A bad movie\\, not just a bad star wars movie. The scenes were all over the place\\, most of the plot made no sense\\, and they kill the lore and dont respect the basic laws of the star wars universe. Plus every actor is a comedian\\, and luke drinks tit\/balls milk. Rian should be ashamed.","true":true}
