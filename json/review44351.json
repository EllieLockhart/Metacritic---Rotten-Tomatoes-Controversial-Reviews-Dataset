Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many plot holes\\, pointless characters\\, story lines. It was a big sloppy mess. There wasn\u2019t even a decent lightsaber fight. It looked cool\\, but it doing for me.","true":true}
