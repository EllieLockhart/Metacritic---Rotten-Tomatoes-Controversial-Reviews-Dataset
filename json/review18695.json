Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I truly enjoyed The Last Jedi. There are a few plot holes\\, as there are in most movies\\, put they are easily overlooked because the movie moves the saga along. It neatly hands the future to a new group of heroes (and bad guys) while giving their predecessors their due. I thought it was Mark Hamill's best performance EVER.","true":true}
