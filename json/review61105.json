Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"It's an absolute shame that Naughty Dog continues to prove that no game company is infallible. The story has been ripped of it's charm and is now full of nothing but cheap shock value and parts meant purely to just cause anger. Spoiler part: The story has been immediately ruined in the first few hours when Joel is killed off for shock value. The angry child of a girl who did it is one of the main characters now and you play as her for a large part of the rest of the game. The story tries to be spun as Ellie being the bad guy for going after revenge\\, even though she literally watched Joel's head get beat in in front of her. Ellie is then to the side storywise\\, and is a very one track personality for the remainder\\, instead of the very lively and deep character she was in the previous game. Some games pull the \\\"flip the player character trick\\\" well; TLOU 2 is not one of them. Pathetic showing from Naughty Dog\\, and I genuinely wish I could get a refund.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
