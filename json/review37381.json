Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The problem I have with The Last Jedi is with the many different plots happening\\, especially with the Canto Bight scenes. All the characters were poorly written and I didn't care any of them. The stuff that was built up from The Force Awakens was discarded and questions from it were ignored. While the visual effects and music were good\\, the plot\\, characters\\, and dialogue were awful.","true":true}
