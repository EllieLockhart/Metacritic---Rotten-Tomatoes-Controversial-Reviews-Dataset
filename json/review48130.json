Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While there were a few plot points missing such as the origin of Snoke\\, and just the entirety of Phasma's character\\, but the story had plenty of fantastic character development. Was it as good as Empire? Absolutely not. Was it as fun as Empire? More. I would still recommend this movie to anyone.","true":true}
