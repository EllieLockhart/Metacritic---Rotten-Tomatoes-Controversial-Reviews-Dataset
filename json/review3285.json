Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Been a fan since the beginning. This was an entertaining movie from start to finish. Funny how three major criticisms are consistent with the original trilogy. \u2014spoilers\u2014 The fact we know nothing about Snoke\\, what did we know about the emperor in the first trilogy? Also Obi Wan became one with the force without being struck by Vader. Why couldn\u2019t Luke do the same and more after studying the force for 40 years. Also\\, there has always been an element of humor in Star Wars movies\\, more so in the original trilogy. In this world where everyone wants instant gratification and can just binge watch to get answers. Star Wars has successfully restored the sense of mystery of the unknown that I left the theater with for every movie in the original trilogy. For example\\, I had to wait three years without internet to understand what the hell happened in empire strikes back (force ghost\\, your father\\, move objects!\\, crazy stuff). How many answers did we have back then? The mystery of the force has always been one of the best parts of the Star Wars saga\\, glad it is back. Crazy the rage. Be open minded and enjoy!","true":true}
