Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Half of this movie was rendered entirely un-necessary (the movie equivalent of a make-work project) due to giant plot-holes.  The half that didn't suffer from this was quite good\\, but unfortunately I was a bit distracted since it really stretched 'suspension of disbelief' to the breaking point.  In a weird way this has redeemed the prequel trilogy\\, I guess?","true":true}
