I was amazed by it and right after finishing wanted to shout into the world how amazing the game is. So don\u2019t let yourself be too influenced by some of the hate (not saying there can\u2019t be legitimate criticism!) and just play it\\, you will not regret it. The story holds up\\, and while it is very dark and leaves you kind of depressed for a few days after playing it\\, it will just really stick with you. If you don\u2019t like consuming that kind of media\\, which is absolutely legitimate\\, you might want to stay away from this one. ND definitely took some risks story-telling wise\\, but they greatly paid off in my opinion. It\u2019s a top 3 game of the decade for me.  P.S.: Really do yourself a favor and play TLOU 1 right before\\, even if you\u2019ve already played it. It\u2019ll make you care for the story and the characters so much more and you\u2019ll pick up on things that you might\u2019ve missed otherwise. TLOU Part II is definitely not a stand-alone title in my opinion.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
