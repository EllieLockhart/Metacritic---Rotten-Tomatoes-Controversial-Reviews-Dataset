Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke's character was a complete 180 of his original character ark - was very disappointing. Finn's character was never progressed - pushed aside for too much rey and kylo. The Republic's capital system was destroyed but suddenly there are 0 republic planets? Doubtful. Overall\\, force awakens and rogue one were far superior recent star wars movies.","true":true}
