Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I felt like the plot itself was messy. A bunch of unresolved conflicts and plot holes also with poor character development in new characters and all around a bad movie plot. This movie was extremely disappointing and I fear for what\u2019s next. ","true":true}
