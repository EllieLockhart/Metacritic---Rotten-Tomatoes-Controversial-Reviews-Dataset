It is annoying how the social justice scenes feel gratuitous and not linked to any plot or character development. They\u2019re just included to virtue signal. However\\, that\u2019s not my major issue. The major issue is that the first game felt like a zombie apocalypse... it was barren\\, it was moody\\, it brooded. After playing the first game that feeling stuck with me for days. The characters you came across felt human\\, they left their mark on you and you moved on. Joel was a grieving father on the brink of a breakdown\\, the complexity of his character - desperation and grief with hope and tenderness for Ellie - was so well written.I\u2019m about 5 hours into part 2 and it feels like a high school melodrama. The characters gossip and chatter constantly. The social justice scenes serve no plot points. It\u2019s bubbly like a JRPG. Don\u2019t get me wrong I\u2019ve enjoyed Final Fantasy games in the past but that\u2019s not why I\u2019m here. I\u2019m here to go back into that world I saw in the first game. I\u2019m left disappointed.Naughty Dog have used up all of my \u201cbenefit of the doubt\u201d now. I will not be pre ordering anything again.It\u2019s actually quite sad\\, I wanted this game to be made for so long... and this is what we get... :-(\u2026 Expand","true":true}
