Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi featured a very weak plot that had a few bright spots. The movie seemed to go out of its way of introducing new characters that served no major purpose and left more us with more questions than answers. Overall this was a disappointing installment that seems to have left Episode IX with the impossible task of wrapping up all the loose ends of this continuing story.","true":true}
