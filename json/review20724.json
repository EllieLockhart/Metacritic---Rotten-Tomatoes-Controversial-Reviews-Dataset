Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I walked out of Force Awakens after sitting thru that pile of trash thinking\\, man what did I just see and this young gentleman walking out beside me uttered under his breath\\, \\\" That movie effing sucked!\\\" Yes\\, I thought that's the feeling I have\\, and the next day after having really thought about it I realized not only did it suck\\, but Disney killed Star Wars. The Last Jedi is another corporate slap in the mouth to SW fans\\, another steaming pile of dung wearing Jedi robes disguisING it's intention of totally ruining a great movie franchise. How any adult that likes good films could walk out of the theatre and not hate this movie is beyond me.","true":true}
