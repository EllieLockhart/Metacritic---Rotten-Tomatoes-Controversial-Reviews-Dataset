Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not terrible\\, just disappointing. There were some good moments\\, but they were overshadowed by moments with only one comment for all of them: Why did this happen? Why wasn't it done differently?????","true":true}
