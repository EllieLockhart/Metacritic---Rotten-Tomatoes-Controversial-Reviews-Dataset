Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film on first viewing shcoked me and it was that shock that i mistook for amazing film work because frankly this film is wrong in terms of a continuation from 7 and I believe what the main issue was is that rian johnson wanted to send us in a direction we werent expecting when in fact we wanted this film to be more predictable in terms of story for example admiral akbaar in charge instead of laura dern and luke after talking with yoda lifting the x-wing the apprentice finally doing what he couldn't in episode 5. That would have neen far more compelling than what basically is to new people we dont really care about and are fighting for no logical reason a terrible star wars film on par with phantom menace","true":true}
