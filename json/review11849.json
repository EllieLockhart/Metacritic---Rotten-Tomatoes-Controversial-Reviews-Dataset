Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How was the Last Jedi disappointing? Well\\, I just saw it for the first time yesterday on Christmas. I'm not a Star Wars fanatic like my 34 year old man-child son but I was a bit disappointed. I was expecting Luke Skywalker to be overly eager to accept and teach Rey in the ways of the Jedi but Luke was a major jerk! It seems that Luke is still struggling with his inner conflicts from being a young Jedi so that is why he \\\"sucked\\\" as a Jedi Master and teacher. Also\\, Luke seems to be on the borderline between the light and darkness which affected his successes and failures in teaching a new Jedi generation. And the biggest disappointment\\, Luke pulls a Yoda and just disappears so does this mean he is no longer part of the franchise? Well\\, Carrie Fisher sadly has passed away and so we lose Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher for the last one!? I know Abrams\\, Lucas\\, and other Star Wars dreamers want to conclude this whole series but you guys are killing us older and original fans from the 70's if you just leave us with Chewbacca\\, R2D2\\, and C3PO.","true":true}
