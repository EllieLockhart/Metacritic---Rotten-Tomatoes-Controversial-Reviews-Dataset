Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not a good movie. Now I must admit\\, in my opinion is was no way possible that it could be a good movie considering the abomination that was The Force Awakens. It's as if they producers forgot that Return of the Jedi happened. Still not sure how the empire falls then all of a sudden there is this \\\"First Order\\\" that comes and magically takes its place. Still not sure how we have a Sith aka Ren who gets beat up by a kid who has never picked up a lightsaber in her life....Anyway\\, this movie was more of the same. Lame characters\\, Sith master aka Snoke who is easily beaten by a kid with no training and that same Sith who was beaten by that same kid in the last movie. Luke Skywalker hiding on a planet for no good reason at all....please will someone end this abomination. The only reason it made any money at all was because it's Star Warsand people like myself have to see it because I'm a big fan. Those days may be coming to an end though. I will not see a ham Solo movie. And I may not see episode ix...please can some one make a real Star Wars movie that takes place during the days of the old republic when there were multiple jedi and Sith?????","true":true}
