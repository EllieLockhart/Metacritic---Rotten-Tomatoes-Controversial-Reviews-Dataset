Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"The Last Jedi\\\" is one of the best Star Wars movies\\, certainly better than any of the prequels. The action and emotion are all up on the screen\\, and THIS time around the acting and characters (especially Oscar Isaac as Poe) are better-drawn and more satisfying. Sure it's formulaic\\, but no more so than Batman 9 or James Bond's Quantum of Skyfall Death. Having said that\\, this film also breaks several SW tropes. It is inspiring the way Disney\\, et tal show here that they are unafraid to move past things from the series you'd think were sacrosanct.For me\\, the only negative for these sequels is Adam Driver is a terrible villain. He's not scary at all. Kylo Ren is more akin to the guy holding up the line at Starbucks on his cellphone\\, than an intergalactic monster with telepathic powers. Disney seems to be setting the stage for a new generation of SW characters. A movie series this rich and successful and renewable won't stop after 9. But will they ever be able to recreate a level of empathy for the next generation that we all have for the first one?","true":true}
