Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was it. This was supposed to be what the prequels couldn't be.This was the movie that was supposed to catapult the sequel trilogy into a historic finish that would become a staple of cinema history for years to come. This was supposed to be what Star Wars of a new generation looked to become. This was supposed to be perfect.\\n\\nInstead? It sprinted the first hundred meters\\, limped to the final lap\\, and crawled its way across the finish line. All while taking in the great sights of the environment in which it was failing. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi was easily the most disappointing Star Wars film of the Skywalker saga\\, falling prey to the complete 180 turn from its very safe and traditional predecessor\\, simply because it needed to take \\\"more risks\\\". When all the movie is praised for is its challenges to the original six films\\, what became lost is what it could get away with (which was a lot) simply because of the name attached to it. Rian Johnson was not thinking of this film as the middle act of the trilogy\\, almost as if Disney handed him the final scene of The Force Awakens and just telling him\\, \\\"Here. Do whatever you want with this\\, we don't give a damn. Just make us some money.\\\"","true":true}
