Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If not the worst movie in the Star Wars franchise\\, then tied for it.  My wife and were both ready to walk out early on.  We stayed for our kids\\, one of which wanted to come for his birthday.  They enjoyed it\\, so there's that.  They gave it the following ratings: 9 yo: 9\/10.  15 yo: 8\/10.  16 yo 7\/10.  17 yo: 7\/10.  Wife and I each gave it a 2.5\/10.","true":true}
