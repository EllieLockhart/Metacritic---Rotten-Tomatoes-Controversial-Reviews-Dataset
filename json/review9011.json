Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fucking awful beyond words! Rian Johnson should do jail time for murdering the star wars franchise. Also\\, there's something very strange afoot when every fucking professional critic has praised this shit heap! It's frightening that they have all conformed to such sacharine praise\\, I suspect it's because of fear of reprisal from the PC brigade. Jesus\\, I can't believe how bad this film is\\, is all a bit kafkaesque and George Orwell rolled into one. And no\\, I'm not a bot\\, a racist\\, a chauvinist or alt right member\\, just a very disappointed star wars fan\\,  sorry ex star wars fan.","true":true}
