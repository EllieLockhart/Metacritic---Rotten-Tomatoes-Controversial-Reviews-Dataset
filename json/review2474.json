Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A very sad day for the Star Wars franchise.  I think the Disney braintrust overreacted to people crying TFA was too much like ANH. Weve now gone 180 degrees astray. \\n\\nThe biggest travesty was the disdain showed to characters that built the Star Wars legacy. Ackbar's death seemed like an afterthought. Luke became a lame old man\\, then croaked. Phasma didn't see the character development that she was very much deserving. The only death I liked was that of snoke\\, officially having him succumb to the \\\"rule of two\\\"\\, so to speak.\\n\\nWho knows where the franchise goes from here. What I saw as a promising start with TFA became the raging dumpster fire that is TLJ. What sad sad happenings.","true":true}
