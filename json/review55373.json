Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it! Rian Johnson brings fresh eyes to the world's most iconic space opera. It's simultaneously easy to digest and enjoy\\, while also providing satisfying and intriguing answers to JJ Abrams' mysterious Force Awakens. In true opera-esque fashion\\, he brings never-before-seen battles\\, fresh drama\\, Yoda-approved Jedi spirituality\\, and graphical mind-bending visuals.","true":true}
