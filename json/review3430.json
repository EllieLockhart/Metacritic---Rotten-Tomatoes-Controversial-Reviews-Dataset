Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Best movie since empire. Sorry to those who think cause it didn't explain every one of your theories it was terrible but looking back did any of the original star wars movies explain anything or were they just inspiring and entertaining. Maybe a prequel trilogy on the rise of Snoke will please you???","true":true}
