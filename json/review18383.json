{"101487":141432,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is a dark time to be a Star Wars fan.\\nIt has been heartbreaking to see the fan-base torn asunder and pitched against each other in a polarising and vicious debate.  \\nStar Wars has always been a progressive and political force in our galaxy.  It is an allegory of forces as old as humanity - republicanism vs dictatorship - as seen in the makeup of the OT Rebellion (diversity) vs the Galactic Empire (homogeneity).\\nIt is a story of hope over despair.  Seemingly\\, despair has won.\\nRian Johnson's interpretation of the Star Wars fable was facile and needlessly nihilistic.  In the lock-step age of Trump\\, Putin\\, Xi Jinping\\, Kim Jong Un and Duterte there is a need for inspiring stories and heroic feats in the name of democracy and hope.  Even worse\\, it has given ammunition to misogynists and racists who see this film as the agency of SJW gender politics - and in effect has undermined the hard won gains of progressive movements.  Feminism\\, as personified by Rey and Holdo\\, came across as irrational\\, extreme and absurd.  The diminution of Fin (and the ludicrous scripting of Rose) did nothing for ethnic minorities - actually\\, it belittled black and asian actors with cheap stereotyping.  \\nThere was an opportunity to explore the depression and despair of Skywalker but it was poorly rendered on screen (not Mark Hamill's fault\\, it was the script).  Alone on an island disconnected from the Force\\, haunted by the past - this backstory offered an intriguing arc for redemption and might have been truly inspiring.  If Johnson had appropriated Jacki Chan's Mr Han as the model for Skywalker\\, then we might have had some empathy and emotion.  Even better\\, referencing the Prospero in Shakespeare's The Tempest would have given Skywalker's story depth and dimension.  The Island itself could have been a character\\, filled with visions\\, magical and capricious\\, a hot spot of the Force\\, Dark and Light - a source of a Truth for which Skywalker was obsessively seeking.  Instead\\, we got the sea cow\\, fish-nuns and the porgs - new low points in the Star Wars bestiary.\\nCan you imagine the thrill of seeing Skywalker\\, rejuvenated by the training of Rey\\, raising the X-Wing from the shallows\\, tears streaming down his face\\, as he accepted the challenge of facing Snoke and the inevitability of death?  That's what overcoming depression means.\\nAnd Rey ... Rey ... what might she have been in the hands of a talented writer.  It was more important to explain her growing power than subvert expectations of her lineage - that was childish of Johnson.  On the island\\, under Luke's care\\, she might have learned that she was trained\\, her memory repressed\\, that she was hidden on Jakku for her protection.  Luke might have explained to her that though her parents were ordinary and humble\\, that she was gifted as a child in the use of the Force\\, that the Force is thus a universal trait of lifeforms in the galaxy - not an inherited legacy.  The Oliver allusion to broom-boy is apparently meant to achieve the same idea - really?\\nA fantastic sub-plot might have been that Snoke\\, appreciating Rey's power\\, might have released the Knights of Ren to hunt her down.  Instead\\, let's go to Canto Bight ... \\nWith TFA\\, JJ Abrams must take some responsibility for the decline of the franchise.  Like The Lord of the Rings\\, Star Wars has succeeded because of a compelling context\\, a rich implied history which stretches back thousands of years.  The success of the Old Republic was underpinned by the Jedi ... so how is it that the Jedi are described by Luke as failures?  He knew that Palpatine unravelled the Old Republic from the inside - the Jedi\\, only at the very end\\, were betrayed by corruption and self-interest.  So\\, how did the New Republic become reduced to a Resistance?  Abrams needed to do a better job at world-building\\, so that we might understand how the New Republic has declined and from where the First Order has risen.  The best film and literature reflects its current context.  Imagine if the First Order was an ISIS like movement - the fundamentalist remnants of the Empire - its malevolent leadership in hiding in the outer rim\\, orchestrating terrorist attacks\\, building an army over time (Mandalorians) to finally settle the matter (now that would have been some Ep IX).  Johnson's concept of a galactic struggle for ascendency has been reduced to an asinine space chase in which the New Republic (aka the Resistance\\, the Rebels) is reduced to a platoon strength detachment in the Falcon is simply pathetic.\\nDestroying the past\\, desecrating monuments\\, burning books are all characteristics of vandalism - not enlightenment.  Johnson's thesis about failure isn't even original\\, nor is his conceptualising of ambiguity - these ideas were handled brilliantly in Empire.  There can be no stronger exemplification of the slender thread that divides light and dark than the confrontation between Skywalker and Vader on Dagobah.  \\nWith all the talent available to Lucasfilm and Disney\\, how did this happen?  In my view the franchise was never healthier\\, the fan-base never more expectant\\, than in the weeks leading up to TLJ.  That this mediocre film did as well as it did is evidence of the enormous contemporary appetite for a story of hope and redemption and the return of Luke Skywalker.  \\nTragically\\, that enthusiasm is now all used up - I\\, like many fans\\, feel completely betrayed and demoralized.\\nRian Johnson's writing lacked maturity\\, understanding and control.  Thanks to Disney and Kennedy\\, he certainly didn't lack for ambition\\, opportunity or power - or failure. \\nI wonder if the lesson will be learned.","true":true}
