Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By far the worst of the Star Wars saga. I wondered what it would take to make me actually want to watch The Phantom Menace\\, well TLJ did the trick. The Force Awakens wasn't great\\, but it did leave fans with open storylines that we wanted addressed. Well everything good in the Star Wars saga was undone by TLJ. I kept waiting for the orphans to break out in \\\"It's the hard-knock life\\\". If you haven't seen TLJ\\, go watch the trailers and call it a day\\, they are infinitely better than the movie.","true":true}
