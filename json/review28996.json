Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really enjoyed this film! it takes you in places you don't expect to go. And its not a perfect movie\\, but one i will enjoy seeing for years to come. I can't wait to see how they close out the trilogy.","true":true}
