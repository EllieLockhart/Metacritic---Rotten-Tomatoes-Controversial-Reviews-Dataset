{"101487":114373,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Criticisms of Last Jedi: 1. Nothing happened\\, the only difference at the ned of the movie was that Luke is dead\\, 2. We didn't find out anything about the most interesting characters\\, rey's parents were nobody\\, snoke was nobody\\, kylo is still a brat 3. the side storyline was pointless to the plot of the movie and the extra characters did literally nothing\\, also they released a bunch of domesticated animals who would obviously not survive on their own or just be recaptured the next day 4. there was no moral or purpose to anything and there was no motivation for the bad guys\\, not sure why Ren didn't kill Hux 5. Luke's force move thing has never been seen before in star wars and was way lamer than him being able to stop all those blasters using the force 6. Snoke was completely useless and the reveal that kylo was going to chop him in half was so painfully obvious\\, he was basically taunting kylo into doing it 7. I thought that the whole 'She already has everything she needs' speech by Yoda seemed eerily reminiscent of communism when they burn books because past knowledge is not useful (turns out she may have kept the books in the Falcon\\, which\\, if true makes it slightly less bad). 8. That code breaker guy was an obvious traitor\\, not sure why that was a surprise.  9. There were also no good lightsaber battles at all :(. 10. Did you notice that the bombers somehow could literally 'drop' bombs in space and they fall to the target\\, how does this work?? All that being said\\, the hyperspace destruction of the imperial fleet was epic\\, yoda showing up in animatronic form was cool but overall the movie just seemed to have no purpose and didn't explain anything that I wanted to know. The worst thing that\\, admittedly\\, is common to the Star Wars franchise as a whole\\, is that the bad guys are SO useless and stupid. They overwhelm the good guys with force and weapons but are completely garbage at using them.\\nAlso\\, Leia is just going to be dead at the start of the net movie so she gets no send-off whatsoever.\\n\\nOverall the movie is a huge disappointment. I left asking all the same questions I had at the start of the movie and just not feeling entertained.","true":true}
