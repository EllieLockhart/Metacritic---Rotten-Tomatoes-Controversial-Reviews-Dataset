Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm an original 1977 fan. I have seen all the films and only hated TPM. I will say this about TLJ. IT ROCKS! It is the MOST ADULT STORY in ALL the Star Wars movies. I loved Leia\\, I loved Luke and I get him. I would have reacted the same way if I new I had to kill my sisters son....I would said F**k it and sat on an island too. The arc for Old Man Luke was FANTASTIC. I won't say anything else but know that I've been SO upset with all the moaning about this film DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT (while these same folks hated the TFA because it was too similar to the original Star Wars) that I had to take the time to signup to this crazy website and spend my time posting a review. This film is not a remake AND I'M SOOOO HAPPY FOR IT. This was brave and fun and shocking and wonderful. I have seen it twice and plan to see it again. If you don't mind spoilers or if you've already seen the film...take a peak at THIS MATURE SPOILERISH REVIEW of this film....https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mp9QHrKlV54&t=2s","true":true}
