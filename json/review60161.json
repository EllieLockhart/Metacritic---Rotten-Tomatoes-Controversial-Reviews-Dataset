We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Honestly\\, I think that this game was what it was supposed to be cinematically and so much improved from the TLoU1 mechanically. Storyline(spoiler after disclaimer) - Ellie and Abby\u2019s arch\u2019s make sense if you consider them as real people rather than characters in your story. PTSD\\, sorrow\\, sadness masquerading as revenge\\, and finding closure without finality are all real and I felt it all. I felt the rage and bloodlust after (spoilers until next paragraph) Joel\u2019s death. I felt the confusion at finding all the dead in Seattle\\, I felt the tiredness at the end of day 2\\, the confusion and sense of duty as Abby\\, and when I was at the farm with my family I felt like I\u2019m done but\\, can I just leave it like that. Once I was in this fight with Abby\\, I just didn\u2019t want it to be so personal\\, why couldn\u2019t I just shoot her. Why are the developers making me do this\\, imagine being Ellie in that fight. \u201cWhy do I have to kill her? I\u2019m so tired. I\u2019ve come so far. Is this really what I want or just what I think I need to do. This does nothing for Joel. This kid will die if I kill Abby. I just want this to be over.\u201d And so she chose it to be over. To choose herself and her conscience over revenge. I loved it. Also\\, it had some of the unfairness of real life. I did all this **** to get the surgery kit for her to get merc\u2019ed come on. Lol The story was great if you\u2019re willing to let go of\\, well basically yourself\\, and realize Joel had a good heart yes. But he was far from perfect and made bad decisions\\, and was ultimately as selfish as everyone in that godforsaken world\\, and as Ellie have to go against that mentality in the end. Game mechanics - I liked everything the changed from the first-Finally I have a knife-I can jump-I can craft arrows-I can dodge and get into real brawls-I can make silencers-I can go proneIn general the gameplay was smoother and cleaner than a game from 2013 nothing to write home about. Cons-It felt too easy...? I played it on the hardest mode and it felt pretty easy to kill anything\\, my ammo was usually full\\, my backpack was usually full\\, I found all of the cards. I hope they drop a harder update but that\u2019s about all.Thanks for reading!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
