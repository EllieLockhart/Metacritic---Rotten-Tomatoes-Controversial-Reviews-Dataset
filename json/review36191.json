Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was not a perfect film - many questions are still left unanswered from The Force Awakens. However\\, it was everything a Star Wars film should be: fun and compelling\\, with a story and characters that an audience can connect to. Looking forward to Episode IX to see how everything is tied up.","true":true}
