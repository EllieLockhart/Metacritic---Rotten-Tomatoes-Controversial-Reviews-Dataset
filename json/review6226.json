Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney has ruined star wars. Episode VII was a soft reboot\\, way to really branch out. Episode VIII is more of the same. Disgraced Luke's character. The casino scene was terrible. Physics was thrown out the door more than most sci-fi movies. And the final skimmer scene on the salt planet made absolutely no sense what so ever.","true":true}
