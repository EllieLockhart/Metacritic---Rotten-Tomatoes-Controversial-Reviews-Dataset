Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had many good parts in it but those did not our way the faults. These faults include a pointless side quest and killing off interesting unexplored characters in place of new bland character that did nothing to advance the plot. This movie had a lot of potential but unfortunately it fell flat.","true":true}
