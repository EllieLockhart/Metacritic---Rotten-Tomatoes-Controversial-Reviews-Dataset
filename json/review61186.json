The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I don\u2019t see why everyone is so upset with the game. There is valid criticism of the game\\, but everyone who is review bombing just because Ellie\u2019s gay\\, Lev\u2019s trans\\, and\/or Joel died is pretty dumb. Yes\\, Joel died in a terrible way that he didn\u2019t deserve\\, but that\u2019s kind of the point. This is a post apocalyptic world for christ\u2019s sake\\, a lot of people died in horrible ways. It\u2019s a messed up world where messed up stuff happens to messed up people. Anyone upset that a character died is playing the wrong game. And Joel\\, Jessie\\, and Yara\u2019s deaths being so sudden is really shows how unforgiving this world is. Also\\, the revenge plot didn\u2019t bother me that much. It may be overly used\\, but I felt like Naughtydog put their own twist in it. Ellie\u2019s one true fear is ending up alone. And her leaving Dina on the farm is pretty stupid\\, Ellie feels like she has no other choice. She can\u2019t sleep\\, she can\u2019t eat\\, she being constantly reminded and haunted by Seattle\\, and she feels like it\u2019s going to effect JJ. In her mind\\, the only way to get everything back to normal is killing Abby. Rationally\\, the play knows that it won\u2019t help anything\\, but Ellie isn\u2019t being rational. She\u2019s been traumatized and plagued with terrible thoughts. The one thing she could possibly do to stop it is kill Abby. At the end she doesn\u2019t\\, which a lot of people are also upset about\\, but I really liked it. She thinks of Joel. She thinks of the years she hardly spoke to him after finding out the truth about the fireflies. She thinks o the big he before his death when they were finally going to start trying to better their relationship. She thinks of her decision to try to forgive him. But I think she also thinks of everything Joel has done. He hurt her. He basically killed all of the fireflies. So I think she understand Abby in that moment. They are one in the same. She was essentially trying to avenge her father\u2019s death\\, just like Ellie was. So she let her go. And she ends up alone. And she loses the one thing that still connected her to Joel. Playing guitar. I think it\u2019s perfectly tragic. With all the time and effort she spend trying to avenge him\\, she lost him. No one really deserved what happened to them\\, but that\u2019s the whole point. This game left be emotionally broken for a really long time after I finished my first play through\\, but I feel a lot of what people are criticizing about the game was done very intentionally. So I\u2019m probably biased\\, but I really liked the game\\, and I hope this community gets to a point where we can all have meaningful discussions without the hate. Because the game isn\u2019t perfect\\, but I don\u2019t think it deserves what\u2019s happening to it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
