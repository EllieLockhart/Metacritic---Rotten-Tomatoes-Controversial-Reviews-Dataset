Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Can you imagine going to see a Superman film in which Superman refuses to fly because he feels depressed? Or a Batman film where Batman does not drive his Batmobile because he forgot how to drive?  That's how I felt when I saw Luke Skywalker in this film.\\nThe way Luke Skywalker's character has been treated here is unforgivable.  It has ruined the whole Star Wars story for me.  Mark Hamill the Actor deserves an apology from Disney.\\nThe story\\, the script\\, the unfunny humour\\, this film is a disaster.\\nK Kennedy and R Johnson should resign.  I would not be surprised if the next SW film has pansexuals and romantic stories involving droids.\\nThe only way to fix this is to delete The Force Awakens and the Last Jedi from the canon.  Start again\\, and this time have a clear storyline and follow it through until the end.  Don't make up the story as you go along\\, it doesn't work.\\nCrappy film\\, I don't recommend it\\, I ended up missing Jar Jar Binks.","true":true}
