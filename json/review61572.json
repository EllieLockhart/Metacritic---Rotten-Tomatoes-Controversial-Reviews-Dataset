It allows so much more complexity in levels and lord this game is brutal. When you shoot someone with a shotgun their limbs will just explode\\, headshots when preformed the body will just stand still for a split second before falling to the ground as his friends call out his name. Gameplay 10\/10\rVisuals\\, well it's Naughty Dog what you'd expect but do a favour for me and turn off the motion blur it looks much better. Visuals 9\/10\rNow story is a little hard to explain without any spoilers.\rThe game is split into two segments\\, one were you play as Ellie and the other where you play as a girl called Abby\\,. Why? That's a pretty heavy spoiler but this game takes the approach of \\\"You're the villain in someones story.\\\" That's all I can say The story is weaker than LOU1 but a good story none the less. Story 7\/10\rGive this game a shot. I'm not promising you'll like it but I am saying it's worth giving a shot.\r\rP.S: Can we remember that the internet has different opinions and try not to **** on each other because of that?\u2026 Expand","true":true}
