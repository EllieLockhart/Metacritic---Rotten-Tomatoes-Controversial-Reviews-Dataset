Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson takes a lot of risks here and I think more than often\\, it pays off. It's a beautiful looking film with some hilarious and completely bizarre moments that only spice up this franchise more. It probably goes a bit too far in concluding a lot of the story\\, given that there's another installment in the saga to come\\, and I'm not sure if the Finn - Rose relationship quite works\\, but it's still one of the most vibrant and unique films of the franchise that I'd probably come back to more frequently than \\\"The Force Awakens\\,\\\" as there's a lot more interesting arcs and material to deal with\\, that's paced very well.","true":true}
