Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It\u2019s a good movie\\, very entertaining and engaging but as a SW fan I feel it wasted several important characters giving into the wishes of Disney to move on to their own SW. I find it disrespectful that not only it completely destroys the Skywalker bloodline\\, it leaves it in the shadows leaving Kyle Ren as the last Skywalker (since Carrie Fisher is dead and eventually princes Leia will be too). They wasted Solo\\, and now Luke and Snooke after they build up so much anticipation for both characters. I don\u2019t agree with completely disregarding what made te backbone of SW in order to make something \u201cnew\u201d when they already had the new upcoming trilogy to have their own Disney-SW. what a waste","true":true}
