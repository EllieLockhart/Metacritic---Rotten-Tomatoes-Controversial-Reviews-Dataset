Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wish I could go back in time and do not watch it. I went out of the teather with my eyes bleeding and my heart torn apart. This movie feels like a treason. Everything they did with all the major caracters and the story seens wrong and out of alignment to me. Apart from the special effects\\, which are great by the way\\, all the movie is a painfull and very long bad history that contradicts the previous movies\\, especially Force Awakens.","true":true}
