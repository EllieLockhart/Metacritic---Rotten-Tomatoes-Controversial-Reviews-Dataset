Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worried about Rotten Tomatoes.\\nI checked a few pages of the negatives reviews (one or half star) to understand the low andience score\\, and a lot of them looks fake.\\n\\nNo profile pictures. Short\\, weird profile names\\, much like mine. Because\\, like me\\, they seem to have just created their profiles just to bash this movie.\\n\\nShort texts\\, repetitive and simplistic arguments\\, written by brand new profiles.\\nUnfortunately all indicates that Rotten Tomatoes can bem manipulates by an army of fakes.\\n\\nBtw\\, Star Wars 8 ia great. Don't mind the weird score here.","true":true}
