Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"So I'm seeing alot of negative reviews from ppl who haven't played the game all the way through.  It's a 25-30 hour game\\, so most of these reviews are from ppl who are only partially through the game. I know what happened. Everyone seen that \\\"you know who\\\" died. Turned the game off\\, and ran to give they're bad review. I get it. I was upset to. But the more I played. The more I realized what they did was pure genius. I was so upset about Joel dying that I didn't want to give Abby a chance. And before I realized it\\, she was growing on me. And tbe reason for that was because her and joel are alot alike. What she did was fucmed up. But so was a lot of what Joel did. We never got to see Joel do a bunch of terrible things\\, we just heard about them. This game was more about abbys character transformation\\, the same transformation we seen joel make in the original. This game is an absolute masterpiece\\, and I hope it will get the credit it deserves in time. I know everyone wanted another Joel and Abby Story\\, I did too. But what we got was so much better\u2026 Expand","true":true}
