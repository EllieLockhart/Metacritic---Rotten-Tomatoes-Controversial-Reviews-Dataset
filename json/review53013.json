Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a long time Star Wars fan\\, after watching this movie I felt like crying. Visually pleasing\\, but that cannot redeem the terrible writing\\, shallow characters\\, bad humour completely out of place and lack of respect towards the Star Wars legacy. It felt as if the director\/writers couldn't be bothered to watch any of the previous films. It could've been amazing\\, but it failed in so many ways that I can't begin to count. There are people who have waited for over 30 years to see Luke Skywalker... only to see him turned into a lame character with just as much of a lame death. Two weeks since I saw the movie and I still remember it from time to time and get frustrated. For people who aren't hardcore fans\\, this film might be an enjoyable flick; for me\\, it destroyed any interest in this new trilogy - I'm just going to pretend this movie never happened. At least the prequels had the decency to have their own script instead or re-hashing the original trilogy...","true":true}
