{"101487":132556,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you enjoyed this movie I would love to understand why. I tried to love it\\, I was super excited for it\\, but was colossally disappointed. This is not just a bad Star Wars movie\\, its a BAD movie. There is basically no plot\\, the movie could be summarized into episode 9's opening crawl\\, yet its 2.5 hrs long! \\n     It really felt like Rian Johnson waltzed into this movie\\, took everything ever established in the star wars universe\\, threw it out the window\\, and decided to ignore every mystery and story line from episode 7. Then made an incoherent movie with plot holes big enough to stuff Jabba the Hutt into. I don't even know  where to begin\\, so from the beginning... Apparently bombs drop in orbit? No weightlessness in space? Fine\\, this I can get past. But the idea that Snoke's HUGE flagship\\, and convoy of star destroyers can't take down one lone cruiser? For 18hrs????... In the opening scene\\, one First order ship destroys an entire rebel base from orbit\\, yet one cruiser can avoid destruction from a whole fleet... The First Order must be the most loony bunch of fools ever.  There is no aura of respect or control for the first order\\, they literally seem like a bunch of bumbling idiots.\\nAs for the Holdo part. The idea that Admiral Holdo wouldn't at least tell the people on board that she has a plan? Even if she doesn't tell them the plan\\, she'd say \\\"trust me\\, I have a plan\\\". NOPE\\, I'm going to make you think we're doomed\\, that way you can conjure up your own\\, great\\, crack pot plan\\, that seems exciting\\, send off Finn and a potentially cool character on this plan so that it can be an utter pointless waste of screen time\\, that serves no purpose except a political message. And introduce another potentially cool character that we give 0 development\\, and still don't know if He's the guy they wanted.\\n       That covers the plot holes\\, now for the other crap. Killing Snoke. I have no problem with Snoke Dying in this movie\\, what it does to Kylo is very cool\\, and is one of the highlights of this movie. But if you\\\"re going to hype up a bad guy like this\\, give him that much mystery and power\\, please for the love of goodness let us get to know him. Even if you don't give him a backstory\\, give him screen time\\, let us get to fear and respect him. I felt no emotion when he died\\, it was just a surprise\\, and surprise is good\\, but its not enough. \\n      The way Luke was treated I thought was awful\\, If he returns as a very meaningful Force ghost in episode 9 there can be redemption\\, but that was rough. The only meaningful thing he did in the entire movie was the ending; which was cool\\, but would have been way more meaningful if he had shown up in person. We never did get a true Luke\\, Leia reunion... \\n    Rey's parentage I have no problem with\\, she is welcome to be a nobody. The problem I have with her\\, is her unprecedented ability to use the force. Even if she's stronger with the force than anyone\\, ever. The way she just does all this crazy stuff without training is not true to the established universe. Luke\\, who was being trained\\, struggled to lift a few small rocks on Dagobah. Untrained rey lifts tons of them with no problem. It seems established rules in the universe are again ignored.\\n    The way Anakin's light sabre is handled\\, is curious at best. Luke lost that thing 30 some odd years ago in cloud city\\, wouldn't he at least be curious about where she found it? Maybe not\\, but the huge deal that was made about the light sabre in episode 7 now makes no sense. Why did it call to Rey? How did Maz get it? Based on the way it was treated in episode 8\\, it would have made more sense to have never brought it back into episode 7. \\n      Also\\, the map that is so significant in episode 7 is completely ignored in this movie. Episode 7 makes a big deal about finding this map\\, its on Jakku\\, why? Did Luke make the map? Why did he hide it on Jakku? Apparently its beside the point. I just find it ridiculous that episode 8 made episode 7 utterly disposable.\\n      I'm done ranting. I could get into the ridiculous Holdo light-speed thing\\, or Superman Leia\\, but I choose not to. JJ please salvage this train wreck as best you can\\, and fans\\, let Disney know that we're not pleased. If nothing else\\, we want a movie that makes sense. This was utter Horse S%$#!","true":true}
