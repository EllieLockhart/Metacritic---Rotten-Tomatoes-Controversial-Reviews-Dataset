Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While not perfect\\, The Last Jedi is certainly one of the more mature entries in the franchise's long history\\, and earns every minute of its run time. Sure\\, lightsaber fights and Joseph Campbell stories are fun and familiar\\, but sometimes it's nice to see the things we love grow and learn along with us.","true":true}
