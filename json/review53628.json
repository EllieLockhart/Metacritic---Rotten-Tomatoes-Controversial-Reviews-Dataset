Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Firstly\\, there was too much forced humour that did not work for me\\, especially at what were supposed to be serious points in the film. Previous star wars films have managed to be funny without trying to ram as many slapstick gags in as possible.\\nNext they butchered Luke Skywalkers entire character\\, this was not the same hero from the original trilogy. Also killing off the last of the jedi order is pretty ridiculous\\, and Rey is not trained enough to be considered a jedi.\\nThe chase scene through the casino could have just been cut from the film completely\\, was a waste of time\\, should have used that time to focus on Luke training Rey","true":true}
