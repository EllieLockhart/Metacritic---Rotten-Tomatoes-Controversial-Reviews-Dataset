Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was 7 years old when I first saw Star Wars.\\nI was blown away by Luke Skywalker and what he was able to do.  Then Empire (still the best) and Return.\\nThe other 3 movies were all about anything but Luke and I really wasn't interested.  So when I heard about the new trilogy was being made I was very excited to see what Luke had become since his last scenes in 1983.  So TFA starts and I see Luke for 3 minutes??? Are you kidding me? So let get this straight\\, I was 13 and waited until I was 45 to see Luke for 3 freaking minutes and HE DOESNT EVEN SPEAK!!! So 2 years pass and TLJ comes out and Luke is an old washed up\\, non Jedi master who has run away from the fight to die on an island? This is not what I waited for\\, Disney might as well have pulled their pants down and deficated on the Skywalker legacy.  For the first time in my life I can say I have no interest in anything Star Wars related.  I will not go see episode IX.  I totally agree with the 53% fan review.  Good luck Disney\\, you'll need it.","true":true}
