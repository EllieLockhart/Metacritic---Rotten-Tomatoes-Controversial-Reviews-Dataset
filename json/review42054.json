Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie makes the prequels seem like Oscar winners. Jar jar binks was a better character than these shallow characters forced upon us. Good space fights give it the only positive. After waiting 30 years for Luke to be the ultimate Jedi I left the movie feeling betrayed and like something was stolen from me. I will not see episode 9 or any other \\\"star wars stories\\\"  ever again.","true":true}
