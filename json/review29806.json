Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Right now 85\\,487 user ratings on RT have it averaging 3.3\/5 stars and overall 57%.  I'm scratching my head. I don't always agree with the critics but this time they are dead right.  This one is one of the best in the franchise yet. Better in every aspect than TFA\\, and hits harder than Rogue One for sure.","true":true}
