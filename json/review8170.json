Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic movie. Go see it. I've gone twice now. I loved seeing Luke again. I love the new cast. Good to see the torch getting passed on to another generation of Star Wars Rebels. I guess some people were not happy or something. Not sure why. I loved Star Wars since I was a (80's) kid. Overall\\, 100% worth the ticket price.","true":true}
