Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a piece of ??.  I had to watch it a second time to realize that whoever produces this should be flipping burgers at McDonald's.  Ruined the Star Wars legacy forever??????","true":true}
