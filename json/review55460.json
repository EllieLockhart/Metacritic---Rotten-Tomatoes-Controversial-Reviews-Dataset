Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mixed feelings for this one. On the one hand at time it feels like Star Wars\\, and seeing the old heroes is fun. On the other hand many of the ideas appear to be copied from good sci-fi shows but don't feel like Star Wars. This movie definitely operates in a completely different genre compared to the classics and some of the creative decisions appear to have been taken simply to go against the conventions of Star Wars\\, and not as a way to create a richer universe or dig deeper on the motivations and personalities of the characters. You end up pretty confused as to what the purpose of the film is and what several plot artifacts are there for. Other than that\\, it's a piece of unconsequential entertainment and nothing ressembling a classic. I will never watch it again and doubting if I will go to the cinema for the next installment. Lucasfilm should learn from Marvel and decide what genre they're operating in.","true":true}
