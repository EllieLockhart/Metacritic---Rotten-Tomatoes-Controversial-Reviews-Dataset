{"101487":138054,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-06-16","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Initially when I sat in the theater with my son to see this film\\, we were  both very excited to see where the story and characters would go. Between the two of us our reviews were mixed at best. Some amazing scenes in the film were overshadowed by terrible blending of futile sub-stories. Background stories that could had been utilized for further character development rather than fillers.\\n\\nUnlike the flowing appeal of the other franchise films\\, 'Last Jedi' felt forced\\, superficial\\, and cluttered. It was evident that there was little to NO focus on continuing a richer character development. It had many moments where I questioned how many rewrites the screenplays had\\, how many scripts were we really looking at on screen? The opportunities were there\\, the script was not. \\nUnlike the many\\, I really love the new introductions of characters. I love all characters of Rey\\, Kylo\\, Finn\\, Rose\\, Poe...I would had hoped for more for this characters. \\n\\nFree Advice: The audience needs to fall in love with the characters\\, not just shove characters in without real elaboration. 'Force Awakens' began this process (beautifully)\\, while 'The Last Jedi' struggled to maintain story telling through-out.\\n\\nAs far as the plot\\, plenty of predictable twists and turns. So much so\\, I hope for the next there is canon...not CGI fillers with a few garnishes of canon. I don't mind new twists to canon\\, as long as it flows. \\n\\nI'm not an elitist about the canon\\, but there are plenty of moments of \\\"WTF\\\"---it makes for cringe worthy moments. Lost moments of superb story telling.\\n\\nSeven months later after seeing 'Jedi' in theaters\\, I can't recall the ending at all\\, I recall some parts in passing. It was forgettable and that's distressing.\\n\\nSadly\\, there is nothing there that stirs the spirit to see the next. It's so disappointing to say this about a franchise I had staunchly loved for so long. But money is money...Time will tell if we will take the bait again. \\nSadly these films are becoming politicized\\, it's NOT so much of what is in the films that are the issue. It's the echo chamber of of blame and moral outrage that people hated from these films. \\nThere's so much of it\\, I've tuned out ANYTHING from LucasFilm\/Disney on social media or likewise. Bad reviews\/opinions\/ are blamed on the evils of white and\/or sexists. Are there such things in the world? Absolutely\\, but not every negative review should be treated as the Anti-Christ. But it's what we are hearing more of via the media.\\n\\nAs for my 19 year old son? He feels the same about the rhetoric surrounding this film franchise right now\\, as do many of his male\/female friends. It's considered pablum.\\n\\nAs a parent to three kids\\, I want them to love Star Wars as I did as little girl. I wasn't born when the first Star Wars hit theaters and was an infant for the second. However\\, I fell in love with the adventures and characters from Star Wars from the moment I watched them. I was raised a classic feminist\\, so I never thought twice about who played what role in the film. All I knew was\\, I wanted to be a female Jedi and kick some ass.\\n\\nMy family is mixed AF\\, as most Americans are. Yet we've focused on our differences...so much so now\\, the utopian future of living together in harmony seems even farther away. Why is that? Why has it gone to this place?  Racism? Sexism? Capitalism? Political Opportunism?\\n\\nFor us\\, we want well developed films of heart and passion. Not superficial pandering. Even with the dated allure of the first films\\, there was heart and passion and sense of adventure. Force Awakens? I really enjoyed it\\, despite moments of mixed canon and other points that could be made. It was memorable and fun.\\n\\nI hope\\, for the sake of childhood nostalgia not just for me but for my kids\\, something can be resurrected with that excitement and allure that many love about this franchise without burning down the coliseum completely with moral outrage. If one isn't careful\\, this is how influence can be stripped away...all with a tweet.\\n\\nTL;DR: I've added my two cents\\, uselessly.","true":true}
