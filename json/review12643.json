Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can understand why some fans are upset but it\u2019s not as bad as some will make out. Yes\\, it has plenty of flaws\\, and could be re-edited to make a shorter far better Star Wars movie but the stunning cinematography and gasp moments just pushed it over the line to make it a better film than any of the prequels. Go see it and judge for yourself. You will be entertained! The jokes will make you laugh even if they are in the most part out of place. ","true":true}
