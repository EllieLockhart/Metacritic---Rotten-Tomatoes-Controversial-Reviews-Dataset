Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing whether compared to its predecessor or not\\, The Last Jedi fails to carry on the momentous story that The Force Awakens started. By wasting its runtime on anything but character development\\, focusing the entire plot on a minor conflict in a major war\\, and lacking emotional depth\\, Johnson clearly wasn't the right person to pick up where Abrams left off. The Last Jedi may be a blockbuster but it's a let down to all Star Wars fans.","true":true}
