Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rubbish. 45 minutes of dragging followed by another 45 minutes of disney merchandising props (porgs and crystal critters)\\, with 20 minutes of useless story hanging on a poor plot point. The star is there because it is visually stunning. Storywise\\, it is utter shite and whoever wrote this was so clattered and was high up enough at disney that no one dared to look and say \\\"wait\\, what?\\\"","true":true}
