Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What the heck happened to leia?!? why does she have a lightsaber and a beard? is she a ghost now? (I really hope she's a ghost so she can talk with the goblin thing more.)\\n\\nI really liked main charector girl and main charector boy\\, I hope they get together. but evil main charector boy might marry main girl XDXD \\n\\nbe prepared for a lot of plot points that dont make sense and a story that goes nowhere.....5\/5 stars!","true":true}
