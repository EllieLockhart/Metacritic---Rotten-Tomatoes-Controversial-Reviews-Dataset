Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had a strong feeling that this was going to be the best star wars film of all time\\, maybe even on par with Empire. But unfortunately the movie focuses more on lowering expectations than it does telling a good story. This can barely even be called a sequel to the force awakens because it ignores practically all the possible plot ideas brought up in the previous movies. And that might be the movies greatest fault\\, instead of adding on to the story of the force awakens\\, it would rather try to just be its own movie even though it needs to build off the previous movie. The new locations are bland or pointless\\, the characters are either derailed\\, wasted\\, terrible or overpowered\\, there are multiple plot holes that Rian Johnson himself has to explain almost every day\\, and most importantly it just isn't an enjoyable movie. I'm that guy that likes the prequels\\, and I will say without any regret that this movie is worse than attack of the clones.","true":true}
