Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is so bad I created a RT account just to warn you never to watch this! I don't know what drugs the critics were on when they watched it\\, or if they marked it high as they were scared of the Starwars fans or afraid of not getting paied off by Disney\\, but this film made the new Fant4stic movie look like a Oscar winner! I would rather watch the prequels 1000 times before watching this total crap again. This film it that bad it makes you feel angry\\, it throws out everything you were looking forward to from The Force Awakens. It tries to force a  feminist statement onto you but has the complete opposite effect\\, as you end up hating all the useless\\, worthless and dumb females in the film. The directors tried to make the women stronger by making all the male characters\\, even dumber\\, idiots or bad guys.\\nIf you like Starwars DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM or it will kill the franchise off for you like it did for me.\\nThe last Jedi.....well the Last Starwars film I ever see!","true":true}
