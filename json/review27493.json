Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall good movie. Definitely some things that felt like they were pulled from Empire. Still not sure how I feel about where they took Luke\u2019s character. The constant theme that is seen here is that past things were left to die. The Saga is now truly moving forward on its own merits. ","true":true}
