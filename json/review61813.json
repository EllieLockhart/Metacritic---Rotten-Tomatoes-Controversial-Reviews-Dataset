Joel\\, just like Luke\\, gets completely s**t on just to \\\"subvert expectations\\\"\\, a slap in the face of all fans of TLOU part 1.

I don't know what they were thinking when they wrote this\\, but they clearly missed the mark\\, at least with fans of the original. A low score is given for ruining and killing off one of the most beloved and interesting characters without even giving him a proper ending or purpose.
