Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"91%?  People are forcing themselves to like this terrible movie.  Don't really like any of the characters including Luke surprisingly enough.  Kylo Ren is a sissy and Rey is basic.  Poe is the only character with balls and all they do is punish him for not blindly obeying authority.  The movie begins with them running from the first order and ends with them running from the first order.  I don't need my Star Wars movies to be great\\, all I ask is that they don't suck.  This one sucks....FIX IT DISNEY!","true":true}
