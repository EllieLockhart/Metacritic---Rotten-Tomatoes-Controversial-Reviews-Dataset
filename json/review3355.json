Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Besides a visually stunning movie\\, Kylo Ren at some points and the performances of Mark Hamill and beloved Carrie Fisher this movie would get 0 stars. Obviously anything dealing with Finn and rose was abysmal and added nothing to the movie\\, including the overt political tones used frequently. Leia flying through space is iffy at best\\, this version of Luke Skywalker must be a clone because this cannot be the same like from 4 through 6 and I grew up on the prequels. I love women with a passion like 10 thousand suns but why Star Wars has to be this gender battle where all the men are incompetent is just confusing. A lightsaber battle was not seen in the movie. Rey and Kylo fight praetorian guards cannot count. Anything regarding the force awakens is now mute thanks to Rian Johnson's complete fuck you to Abrams and any fan that has watched Star Wars 4\\, 5\\, 6\\, 1\\, 2\\, 3\\, and 7 excluding the decent but forgetful rogue one. Trash Rian\\, and hopefully you've seen the video or Mark Hamill reacting.","true":true}
