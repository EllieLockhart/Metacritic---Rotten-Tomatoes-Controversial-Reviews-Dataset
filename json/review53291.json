Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Completely ruined star wars. From first scene with ridiculous prank phone call skit i knew the film was going to be bad. Its star wars not space balls. The film just got worse\\,  it was completely disneyfied...targeted for 10 year old children. Destroyed all of the arcs from tfa...my god what was leigh..mary poppins flying in space. I cannot understand how people like this film.. it is not star wars material. I mean what's the next film going to be about? Seriously bad film was very disappointed....can you tell?","true":true}
