Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How did they think sjw crap was going to fly? Serious fans are weeping at the flaming dog turd that is now Star Wars. I hope Disney slips on a crack and breaks its mother back.","true":true}
