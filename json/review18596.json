Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It looks like a star wars movie\\, it feels like a star wars movie\\, it can be enjoyed like a star wars movie\\, but something fills off \\, there is something that stops it  from actually being a star wars movie.... oh yes... killing frekkin Luke Skywalker before he had an actual normal lightsaber duel\\, or ... I dont know crushing one of those new ATATs with the force or something\\, fly an xwing perhaps\\, he's one of the best pilots after all. I honestly love this movie and I truly hate it so 2.5 stars (balance to the force this movie brought )","true":true}
