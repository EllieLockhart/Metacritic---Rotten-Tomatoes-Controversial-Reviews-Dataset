Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Finally had the chance to watch the Last Jedi and I came out not impressed. I thought the force awakening was actually a better movie and Rogue One being the best released since Disney became owner of the franchise. The last Jedi never got me into the movie and just felt the same from start to finish. I was waiting for the suspense to build up but to many plot holes through the entire movie. I was very disappointed with the character development from Snoke and hopefully the scene of reveling Rey's parents was a lie. Snoke literally just was sitting around using the force like a god his demise was very disappointing. I thought this movie had a great potential but writing\\, plot holes and character build up failed\\,","true":true}
