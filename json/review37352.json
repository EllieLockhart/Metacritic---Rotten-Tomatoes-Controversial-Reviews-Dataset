Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The point of the movie seems to be men are impulsive and short tempered and need to be saved by patient strong women.  I like strong female characters\\, but this movie is just pandering.  I'm afraid if this trend continues it will actually push men to chauvinism.","true":true}
