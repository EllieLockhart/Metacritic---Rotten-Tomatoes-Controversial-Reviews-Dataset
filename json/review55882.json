Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really dissapointed. Not only at the movie\\, but also with the \\\"critics\\\" reviews. The Last Jedi has great visuals\\, some awesome scenes\\, and some great actors. But having that do not makes a movie. A real movie is about a story and about character development. TLJ do not have either. Not only that\\, it do not honour the saga it's supposed to belong to.  Forced humor\\, in a Disney way\\, not the \\\"cheesy scifi\\\" humor of the original trilogy\\, no. Instead the Goofy pointless kind of bad humor.  Great actors and characters are wasted. Stupid things and Deux Machina moments used to \\\"justify\\\" the original mysticism of the saga... And all around a script so poorly written is painful to watch a second time.  I get the \\\"is a child movie\\\"\\, \\\"is an entertainment piece\\\"\\, and all that. I didn't expect a Kubrick intellectual plot. Only a SciFi movie which honoured the characters of the past\\, portrayed a nice farewell to Luke\\, Leia\\, Palpatine\\, etc.\\, introduced new\\, exciting heroes and villains\\, and set the story forward. But no. Hollywood\\, Disney\\, Lucasfilm\\, Kathleen Kennedy\\, Rian Johnson\\, and all those has this problem of downplaying films because they think people are stupid\\, and then try to convince us that there was a plot where there is nothing but thin air...  Movies are about stories\\, not vignettes and awesome scenes...","true":true}
