Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was such a disappointment. It held no respect or regard for the spirit of the Star Wars world. From the first scene of the movie to the last\\, the tone was flippant and careless. If you love Star Wars and cherish the characters\\, do not see this movie. It only serves to destroy everything that you hold dear. It was an onslaught of bad jokes\\, uninteresting plot\\, and nauseating marketing ploys. It spectacularly fails the new characters that The Force Awakens so carefully brings to light. I never thought I'd say this but it makes episodes 1\\, 2\\, and 3 look like Oscar darlings in comparison. I so badly wanted to walk out of this movie\\, but kept hoping that it would somehow salvage itself. Spoiler alert- it did not. Rian Johnson must not understand that the true Star Wars base expects more than your average superhero movie. Ugh. : (","true":true}
