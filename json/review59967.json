Part 2 is much more controversial in terms of storytelling. Agree or disagree with the first few hours of the game. It get\u2019s better and better throughout playing and it has one of the most intense endscenes  of all gaming for me. Music absolutely gorgeous and much darker than the first one. Fyi Mac Quayle from \u201cMr Robot\u201d worked on the score too along with Gustavo. This sequel is much more creative than the first one in terms of gameplay. The fact alone\\, that enemies are crying for their shot friends is just terrifying to look at. Dog\u2019s are crying too if you shoot their owner btw.. The only issue that I have with this game are some long passages throughout playing the second half of the game.\r\rTry this game with an open mind if you played the first one.\r\rOne thing\u2019s for sure. Player which did not play the first one are 100% satisfied with it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
