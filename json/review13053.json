Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know how anyone could dislike this movie. They fixed everything wrong with the force awakens and created  a whole new view of how the force works . Is it perfect no but it's fun what more do you want .","true":true}
