Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great continuation in the Star Wars Universe. While this directly goes against alot of the format of the original movies\\, I appreciate that they take from Legends Canon in painting a universe where not everything is clearly Good vs Evil. Having the decisions of the characters have real consequences puts this solidly in line with the direction that Star Wars canon was going into the NJO series and i love that this was carried through and brought to life in a whole different way. Can't wait to see the last movie in the Rey saga.","true":true}
