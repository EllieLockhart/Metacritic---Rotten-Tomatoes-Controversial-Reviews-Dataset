Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was rather disappointed. The huge build up on major Characters only to kill them off. Why bring Luke back if he wasn't actually going to do anything???? Last Jedi is a huge let down. Noticed many of the other patrons in the theater felt the same way. Save your money\\, watch it on Netflix.","true":true}
