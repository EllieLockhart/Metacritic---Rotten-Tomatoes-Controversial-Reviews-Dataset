Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have spent two days\\, deliberating.  The bottom line is\\, the only redeeming factors is the Rey-Kylo evolution\\, and several action sequences.  And\\, the characters and aome dialog are likeable.\\n\\nBut wow\\, the plot line forced activities of pointlessness\\, Luke ending is very disturbing.  It just sucky sucks and the insults to legacy of what was accomplished and great characters of episodes 4 through 6.  I mean\\, please.","true":true}
