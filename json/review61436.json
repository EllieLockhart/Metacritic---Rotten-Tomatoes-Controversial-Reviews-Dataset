Some people said that the game is trash either because of Joel's death or because of a bad ending or I even heard a few people saying that they don't like that game because of Ellie being lgbtq and stuff.\rI heard that some didn't even see the whole game and already don't like the game. Some even said not to buy the game...\rNow I don't mean to attack the people who don't like the story or the game itself but I think that it's actually kinda sad that so many people hate the game already because of the story. But like myself of course everyone has their own opinion and everyone has the right to share their own opinion to the game with others.\rThe story is actually pretty intersting but also kinda sad because of stuff like Joel's death and Ellie being alone in the end. It's only realistic that people like Joel die one day because one way or another everyone dies one day. I can understand why Joel got killed\\, it's because he just had many enemies and the killed people to survive just like everyone else. And Abby in this case wanted to take revenge. After Joel's death Ellie wanted to take revenge on the people who killed Joel and that's completely understandable because I would probably do the same. I think that Ellie actually made the right decision to let Abby go in the end and if Ellie killed Abby then there's a possibility that Lev wants to take revenge on Ellie if he survived his injuries. In the world of the last of us it's really hard to trust someone because everyone has to fight to survive.\rIt's just sad that Ellie was completely alone in the end especially to think that in the first part of the last of us she said that she was afraid to end up alone one day.\r\rThe graphics of the game itself were perfect. It even had so many little beautiful details that made the game so realistic. It's just amazing.\r\rStuff like the health bar or listen mode were actually a little better in the first game of the last of us. The health bar was better in the first game because it was easier to see how much health you have left and the listen mode was also better because you could see a little better which way your opponent was facing.\r\rSo in my opinion the game was just really beautfiul and realistic.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
