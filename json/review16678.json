Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I need to watch this again as I can\u2019t believe it was as poor as I remember. my initial thoughts are that I feel let down it did not live up to the hype there was to much humour the plot was vey disjointed and a certain clip involving space and a lady actress was the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve seen in a Star Wars film I really considered leaving at that point. This is the biggest film franchise in the world with the might and money of Disney behind it now if this is the best they can do just finish this trilogy off then leave it before all the movies get tainted by this poorly executed film.
