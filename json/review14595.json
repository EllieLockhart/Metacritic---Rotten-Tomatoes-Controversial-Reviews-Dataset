Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a Star Wars fan my whole life and  grew up on the prequels. However\\, I watched the Force Awakens and thought it was an okay movie but was really looking forward to the last Jedi because of Luke. However\\, Luke was not in this movie. Mark Hamill played a totally different character. Also\\, every man in this movie was torn a part by the woman character to make themselves look superior. It was a horrible movie.","true":true}
