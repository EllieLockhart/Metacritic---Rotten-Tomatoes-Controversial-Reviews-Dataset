{"101487":129260,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"\u00cfA \u00cfA praise KEK Shadilaaaaay!! your beloved childhood hero\\, you can put'im in that dark place of yours...\\\" - Empress Kathleen Kennedy\\n\\nN\u00b01 SW french fan here\\, I'm a 75% SW phemotype\\, a vast walking memeplex. I'm that annoying guy who pisses off the wife and his entourage with SW and who has read pratically all the books and played all the games\\, I won't go too much into details but to make it short\\, Star Wars is my f*cking life. And I'm here to make a review and also a mourning\\, because my Star Wars is no more. \\n\\nSo here's my honest review with SPOILERS: To sum up this steaming pile of horsesh*t in three words: Chaotic\\, inconsistent and frustrating. These wankers of pseudo cineasts had 10 years to cook something of value for the fans\\, they have all the money\\, they had countless descent materials to inspire from... and\\, that's all they can come up with?? this is absolutely unforgivable\\, this is a middle finger to the legacy\\, a childhood rape of a cosmic magnitude. Disney\\, Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson should be sued for this abomination. \\n\\nThe script is horrendous as well as the directing\\, there're lots of amateurish technical issues and poor camera angles choices that really shouldn't be there. The Marvelisation is horribly strong\\, the dialogues have no substance\\, nothing stands out\\, the jokes are torture to watch\\, unnecessary smartass cr*p that fell flat everytime. I didn't feel one second in a galaxy far\\, far away. These new actors are wooden and just don't have the talent to immerse the audience and make believe just one bit\\, they look disconnected most of the time\\, it all felt forced and superficial. There is no backstory to any characters. Heaps are there for no reason\\, just to fill the gaping voids. They show no distinctive traits beside their skin color\\, they are shallow\\, dull and forgettable\\, most seem to be there just to make a statement of \\\"diversity\\\" than anything else. The antagonists are worthless and boring\\, and were more childish than menacing\\, I personally don't think I've seen a lot of women in the empire side\\, did you? (besides Kate Dickie and Gwendo\\, both from GOT)\\, most were white males\\, how f*cking surprising!... let's move on\\, the lightsaber duel choreographies were not memorable nor impressive and there were way too few. Artistically speaking\\, the design lacked originality & innovation\\, there was a massive amount of bad taste\\, it's insane. The ships are among the most uninspired and ugliest I've ever seen\\, there was one moment where Boyega and Del Toro were exchanging words in the back of some f*cking ship and it literally looked like a random empty kitchen in inox from a restaurant. The Casino part\\, holy sh*t-d*ck\\, THAT.. was for me the nail in the coffin\\, what in the sh*t were they thinking??! This section of the movie was extremely anticlimactic\\, needless to say that it didn't feel like SW at all. I should've left the cinema from that point\\, but my loyalty to SW made me stay 'til the end.  \\n\\nDisney has ruined the epic saga for good. This movie is a force feed sh*t unconvincing propaganda\\, poisoned with the current Western political trends and virtue-signalling. Men are portrayed as reckless\\, impulsive\\, dumb animals and women as compassionate rational beings; \\\"wooo! yaaay! masculinity is toxic\\, GO MATRIARCHY!\\\". In this new installment\\, the way the Force is represented is baffling\\, mind boggling. From the communication power between the Mary Sue and Kylo to the preposterous scene where Leia flies like Superman in space... come on\\, give me a f*cking break! the force doesn't make you a \\\"god\\\" and that's not how it works! I cannot believe the creators validated this f*ckery! Lot of details didn't make any sense\\, as well as the character's decisions throughout this whole mess; Disney doesn't care about what has been done previously and tramples on the SW foundations like a new dictatorial regime. There's a total disregard and disrespect of the jedi philosophy. 1) Luke during training session telling the Mary Sue to reach her feelings\\, are you kidding me?? this is not a valid jedi advice considering the jedi code 2) Yoda coming out of nowhere\\, looking like sh*t and with a very doubtful Post-modernist brand new mentality\\, destroying in a snap the tree of knowledge (ala Nazi style) and then telling Luke to live in the present and stop focusing on the future\\, meaning literally: reject what sets you apart from the primitive kingdom. What a fabulous idea! And for some reason\\, our supreme valet Rian Johnson decided that the long time dead can come back and interact with the material world! GENIUS\\, if we pursue with that logic\\, then where the heck is Ben Kenobi\\, Anakin\\, Qui-gon Jin\\, Samuel f*cking Jackson etc..? why don't they combine their forces together to stop the Evil Empire once and for all? 3) There's an overly glorifing portrayal of sacrifice\\, as if sacrifying yourself for the collective (because you're jacksh*t) was the most heroic act ever! NAUSEOUS!\\n\\nAnother thing that I find disgusting and disrespectful\\, is that these c*ntbags of movie makers killed the Admiral Ackbar to make room for Holdo\\, you know\\, the Sam Neil's side kick in f*cking Jurassic Park! f*cking brillant\\, innit? ..and you know what? as expected she doesn't fills the shoes. She was completely out of context with her SJW-LGBT haircut and role in the movie\\, calling Poe a Flyboy\\, where do you think you are? In TOP GUN? go back to the Dinosaur Zoo you error of casting. And Phasma... Why the hell is this character still there? the most useless\\, unsatisfying villain in the history of the cinema\\, who.. let me remind you\\, gave the key to destroy the Death Star 2.0 on EP.VII\\, to see Phasma still parading with her glittering armor like in some f*cking d\u00e9fil\u00e9.. Just NO\\, this is totally abnormal\\, she should've been judged and thrown into a dungeon on Dromund Kaas. By the way I'm still searching in my memory where is that powerful man who hates women that Daisy Ridley talked about in a premiere interview.\\n\\nJohnson and Kennedy took the liberty to destroy our childhood hero\\, the man who liberated the galaxy from the Sith. They decided to portray Luke as an irresponsible coward who hides on a random friggin' island\\, and btw certain details in his behaviors didn't fit with his personality (the way he throws without a single consideration his father's Lightsaber\\, the awkward wink to C3PO\\, and the inappropriate hand gesture \u00e0 la Tony Stark). The fans wanted an epic lightsaber duel with Skywalker! not some sh*tty trick \u00e0 la Douglas Quaid from Total Recall or some old fart move ripped off from the Matrix. They made him die for no valid reason like a vulgar fart before the setting sun. I MEAN\\, F*CK YOU!! \\n\\nThe OST by John Williams is alright I guess\\, does the job but nothing memorable. Compared to his previous work on the Anakin Arc\\, this is lazy microwaved stuff. \\n\\nThis is an enormous tragedy\\, George Lucas should've never sold this license to Disney\\, and I wish there could be some kind of petition for claiming back Starwars to the fans or Mr Lucas and finally stop this atrocity\\, enough is enough. To me\\, the Star Wars movies ends with The Return Of The Jedi and goes on with the Timothy Zahn Novels\\, the rest can royally f*ck off. This is a movie made for a specific crowd\\, for the Marvel audience\\, the fatherless generation\\, the low of the low\\, the vulgar monkeys without pre-fontal cortex trapped in unrestrained consumerism\\, and hopeless victims of the economic pressure\\, drones without sense of what is artistically valid and what is not\\, selfish betrayers of mankind.\\n\\nps: Sorry for all the writing mistakes\\, English is not my first language.","true":true}
