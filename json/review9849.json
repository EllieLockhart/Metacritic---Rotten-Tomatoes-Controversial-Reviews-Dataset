Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great addition to the saga. The characters have depth. The conflict is interesting and complex. The biggest weak point is the fact that we never get a back story or explanation for Snoke\\, but he felt too much like a bland Marvel villain from the start so I'm glad they ditched him. Other than that the movie was great!","true":true}
