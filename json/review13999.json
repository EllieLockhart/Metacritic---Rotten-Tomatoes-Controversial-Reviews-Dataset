{"101487":132630,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-08-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you have to explain why your movie is good\\, it's bad. \\nRian Johnson has been on the defensive ever since The Last Jedi came out\\, and for good reason. Many praise Johnson for breaking the mold\\, or for upending expectations. But there is a basic logic to storytelling and movie-making. I never got good marks for saying that 2+2=5. Despite any protestations that my teacher did not \\\"get it\\,\\\" and that I was playing with the formula\\, I still got an F. People use forumlae because they work. Chief among the sins of The Last Jedi is the absence of any backstory or motivation for Snoke. We watch him die\\, without ever being told why we should care. Nor do we see any progression in Rey's skills. She is simply extraordinary\\, was born that way\\, and that's just the way it is. We could have a five-minute movie with that sort of development: Rey is amazing\\, the end. \\nJohnson comes close to some profound statements. It is a fascinating idea that light rises to meet the dark\\, and\\, of course\\, vice-versa. Luke's self-imposed exile makes sense in that context: he refuses to allow the dark to rise to meet his extraordinary \\\"light\\\" power. To explain the inexplicable rise of the First Order\\, it could have risen to meet the rise of the light. That may be too generous\\, but it almost works. It almost works\\, until the moment Luke goes against his newfound middle-road ethos\\, and engages Kylo Ren in a Skype battle (and perishes for his telework trouble anyway). Johnson also comes close to a \\\"certain point of view\\\" storytelling with Luke's near-murder of Kylo\/Ben\\, but it falls flat. \\nJohnson again violates his own ethical thesis when Rose saves Finn. We have been shown that self-sacrifice is useful and necessary\\, only to see a badly-developed romantic interest attempt to kill the guy who's trying to make a difference for good\\, speechify\\, kiss him\\, and then pass out. \\nSpeaking of Finn\\, his character development is non-existent. He made a choice to leave the First Order\\, almost deserted\\, but found his courage in the first movie\\, only to go back to his deserting ways at the beginning of the second movie. And the one who catches him\\, whose sister has just died for the cause\\, somehow falls in love with him after a jaunt on one of the most infamously-bad side-missions in all of cinema history. \\nAnd then\\, there's Space Leia. Rolls eyes. \\nThere are some good elements\\, but the awful elements of the movie vastly overpower those few interesting scenes. I feel I have to add my objective comments to help overcome the senseless encomia coming from the professional critics. There is a major disconnect between those who are paid to review this movie\\, and the people who paid to watch it. I trust that history will help put this movie in perspective as an extremely flawed\\, untethered bit of shlock.","true":true}
