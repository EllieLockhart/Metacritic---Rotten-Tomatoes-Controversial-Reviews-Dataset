Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is a fine example of why critics should not longer be trusted. It sucked\\, massively. Awful acting\\, cheesy unfunny jokes\\, a plot that didn't correlate to the actual story (bizarrely) and unbelievable special powers suddenly appear.\\n\\nAwful.","true":true}
