Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Though it is not a Star Wars movie some fans would have hoped for\\, it is still a great\\, enjoyable movie that set out to do things differently from the same things that has been done before\\, either from the original trilogy\\, games\\, and\/or novels. I totally get where this movie is going for\\, though there are some unnecessary bits to the story\\, it's not as bad of a movie some \\\"hardcore\\\" fan said. I agree that this movie raises more questions than answers\\, and has various problems with it\\, it's still an enjoyable movie that you could watch with your kids.","true":true}
