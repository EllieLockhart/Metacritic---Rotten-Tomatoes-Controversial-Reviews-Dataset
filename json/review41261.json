Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is absolutely trash on so many levels. They have killed star wars\\, I will never pay to see another one.\\n\\nThe visuals and sound are good\\, but that counts for nothing\\, that is par for the course for any modern action movie.\\n\\nThe plot of this movie is boring\\, absurd\\, and full of so many plot holes and bad lines it is impossible to comprehend how the script was approved.\\n\\nIn addition the film failed to pursue any of the established story lines in favor of pushing Rian Johnson's self important themes. That's not subversion\\, that's not creativity\\, that's not being bold\\, it's lazy writing\\, it's TRASH.\\n\\nOn top of all that old characters and themes have been disrespected beyond repair. The arrogance of these people\\, to trash the characters and themes that are the ONLY things getting the audience to the theatre. I will never watch anything related to Rian Johnson again.","true":true}
