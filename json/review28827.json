Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rating 5 to counter act the absolutely undeserved ratings so many \u201cfans\u201d are giving this film. This film has some issues. An entire sequence that I think is unnecessary. And some small dialogue blurps that I think weren\u2019t good. BUT the good outweighs the bad. Without spoilering anything\\, this movie takes so many turns and twists and fleshes out the force so much more than any other Star Wars film. and I think that progression in the mythos is fantastic.
