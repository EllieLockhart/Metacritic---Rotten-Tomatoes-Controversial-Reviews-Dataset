Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first hour doesn't really fit with the saga that ensues.  It has moments towards the end...after a woke up.  The problem:  It's not Star Wars anymore.  It's all dream-filled time warps to make us question what is real and not real....what is time itself....bla bla bla.  I get it....it's cool....but the teleporting of souls is just too far out of the galaxy that I grew up with.","true":true}
