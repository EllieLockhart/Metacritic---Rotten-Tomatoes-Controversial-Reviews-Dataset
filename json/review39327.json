Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is an absolute mess\\, terrible writing. There are episodes of Dragon Ball Z that have more dramatic tension\\, character development and meaning. \\n\\nAnother issue I have with the film is how much identity politics and progressivism is shoehorned into the plot for no other reason but to hijack the franchise for political propagandising. This is coming from someone who believes in these issues\\, and thinks that film is a great medium for exploring political themes. However\\, I just think it is condescending to the audience and distracting to use the film as a vehicle for making 100 different political statements-good screenwriting should not make the audience feel as if they are being lectured\\, pandered to or patronised and Last Jedi does all of these things with an obvious wink-wink nudge nudge to vegans here\\, and whole scene dedicated to illustrating the issue of mansplaining.. as if mansplaining is somehow an important topic to be covered in the Star Wars universe? \\n\\nThe original SW films were great because they had a very simple and easy to understand theme-dysfunctional families\\, and bad fathers\\, and there was a main conflict that gradually built up between Luke and Vader. In Last Jedi\\, the conflict between the main characters felt rushed\\, meaningless and empty. It's like Disney has stipulated to any writer's working on Disney-SW films to avoid making anything too tragic\\, or too traumatising to the audience-the original Star Wars felt like a shakespearean sci-fi tragedy\\, whereas Disney SW is a psuedo-dramatic cartoon\\, with cartoon villains\\, and cartoon heroes who just make witty quips\\, and edgy one-liners. It is one step away from being a parody pantomime where the actors wink to the audience before each punchline. So. goddamn. cringeworthy!","true":true}
