Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a bad ripoff of the older films. Same sentences for the first 3 films. Cmon... And thets just the tip of the iceberg. Not recomended for amyone who rly likes Star Wars (coming from a Star Wars fan).","true":true}
