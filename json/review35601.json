Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a good movie\\, but does not live up to the quality of the two most recent adventures in the galaxy far\\, far away. It seems to chide you for becoming immersed in the feature\\, dragging you back into reality with poor attempts at comedic relief far too frequently. It aims to be a new Empire Strikes Back\\, but is too afraid of emotional depth to let itself flourish.","true":true}
