Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"horrible movie\\, do not see it if you enjoy Star Wars\\nits not that this is a bad \\\"Star Wars\\\" movie\\, its just bad in general.  The jokes are unbearable and often ruin the pace and tone of the movie.  There is no real tone or real pace of the movie.  Which diminishes and takes away from actual good parts of the movie and scenes that are intended to moving\\, serious\\, sad or have an impact of some sort.  In Star Wars terms\\, they made every character Jar-jar at some point and thought it would be ok to have the Jar-Jar at a reveal scene.","true":true}
