Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Look I don't know what the professional critics see in this movie that makes them rate it so highly.  This movie is not without its fun moments but overall it is boring\\, predictable\\, and generally uninspired.  I do not understand what is so difficult about creating a movie with interesting and fantastical aspects that have already been well established.\\n\\nAdventures in this universe are always so full of promise and then you sit down you watch the movie and it is the equivalent of watching d**k jokes for two hours.  The comedic timing is all off\\, the 'dramatic moments' are uncomfortable\\, and there is a weird sexual tension between two of the main characters all of which makes for an overall terrible movie and a disheartening experience.","true":true}
