Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi brings new and surprising ideas to the Star Wars Saga with a very interesting point of view. Rian Johnson does a great job at showing the fun parts of Star Wars while still letting the audience delve deep into the relationships between characters. Although the middle portion of the movie began to lag with a fun yet almost unnecessary sub plot with Finn and Rose(I was excited about them\\, but disappointed a bit)\\, we get to find out more about Poe outside of the cockpit\\, Rey and her trying to find her \\\"place in all of this\\,\\\" Luke's struggle with his past\\, and Kylo Ren's journey to becoming the villain of power he is meant to be. With spectacular performances from the cast\\, a surprise appearance with a reason\\, new Force ideas\\, and of course the epic battles on all fields\\, Rian Johnson took risks and gave fans something unexpected in The Last Jedi. In my opinion\\, sometimes what we want isn't always what is best for a story. At the end of the movie\\, we are left with the idea that the Force doesn't belong to one specific group: Jedi\\, Sith\\, etc\\, but rather it belongs to everyone because  in very wise words\\, \\\"it surrounds US and binds US.\\\" This movie had its points of flaw\\, but that comes with all movies\\, and the amount of backlash it's getting is really dumb. Obviously this is my opinion\\, but this is definitely a movie you have to decide for yourself.","true":true}
