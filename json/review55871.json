Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"RATINGS TRUE STAR WARS FANS:\\n\\nOkay so I have seen this movie twice now. Once on the Friday of the opening weekend and I just saw it again two days later on Sunday. So\\, this is a a 2-time viewing with 2 separate reviews as I digest the film:\\n\\nReview #1 after the first viewing on December 15\\, 2017:\\nAfter seeing all of the incredible movie reviews from so-called \\\"expert\\\" movie critics\\, I spent Thursday & Friday thinking about Episode VIII. The Empire Strikes Back was my favorite of the original trilogy as a kid\\, so to receive comparisons stating that it was \\\"THE BEST EPISODE SINCE EMPIRE\\\" only heightened my excitement. \\n\\nBut\\, here is the truth:  EPISODE VIII is the BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT SINCE THE PHANTOM MENACE\\\". No\\, thankfully\\, Jar Jar was not resurrected\\, and the lead role was not played by a 10 year old - BUT - this movie had ZERO PLOT. It included a 2 hour \\\"chase scene\\\" and it did not have any exciting revelations about The Force.\\n\\nHonestly\\, I cannot believe that Disney made this movie. It was not magical\\, it was not exciting and it was not worth 2 1\/2 hours of my time. My only conclusion is that Disney is only worried about making money. Disney is now \\\"The Empire\\\" and plan to destroy all that existed of the original Trilogy. I am VERY disappointed and do not have any excitement about future Star Wars Epusodes.","true":true}
