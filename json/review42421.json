Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a disappointing 8th installment in a powerful narrative. The story threads that were there in #7 were just IGNORED. Poor JJ Abrams who has to pick up from this failure for #9. I would remaster the last Jedi (#8) and try to keep it true to the narrative. It\u2019s such a shame. The director was either stupid or arrogant (I\u2019m thinking arrogant) and Disney was either arrogant or clueless (I\u2019m thinking clueless) in signing off on this drivel. ","true":true}
