Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was unexpected\\, thrilling\\, and amazing.  I felt like a little kid watching the original Star Wars all over again in the theater.  I don't understand the hardcore fans like myself\\, who are blasting this movie.  Do you want to see the same stuff over and over\\, or be surprised?  Star Wars needs to reinvent itself a little to keep things fresh\\, while still maintaining what we love about it\\, which I fully believe The Last Jedi did.","true":true}
