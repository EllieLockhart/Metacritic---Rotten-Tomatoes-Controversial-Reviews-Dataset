Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Dude\\, I'm not going to make the bizarre criticisms that I saw many do around\\, there are people saying that the game is \\\"too political\\\" and so on. After all\\, all art is political\\, however\\, the ability to entertain is a fundamental piece in this art called \\\"video game\\\"; even to convey a message\\, an excellent script is needed\\, which unites everything\\, makes sense\\, and is minimally interesting.\r\rThis is not the fatal error of TLOU 2.The fact is that i am\\, personally\\, consider myself a progressive on the left wing and even I really hated the game. The narrative tries to assume an intense atmosphere\\, but only generates gratuitous violence and without cohesion with the story itself. Furthermore\\, the story seems to spit in the face of the original TLOU player. The narrative lost its main heart and nothing moved me\\, made me aware\\, or anything\\, except\\, however\\, a specific moment\\, but for the wrong reasons\\, of course.\r\rBesides\\, it is a game that has an incredible visual\\, which sets the tone for the transition to the next generation - PS5\\, but with a terrible\\, suffering and deplorable narrative. The sad thing is\\, at the end\\, i just not want to know what happens next\\, which is the opposite feeling I had with the previous installment.\r\rUnfortunately\\, in this generation\\, i pray that ND to be remembered by Uncharted 4\\, but I know that\\, and with good reason\\, will be hated by TLOU2\\, which is\\, in fact\\, a bad game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
