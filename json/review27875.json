Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Phenomenal. These fans need to chill out. \\nThere are small issues that in no way whatsoever overshadow the wonderful story\\, acting\\, cinematography\\, and experience. It is non stop exciting\\, and I usually get bored easily in long films. One of my favorite Star Wars films\\, it does not disappoint. I cannot wait for the next one.","true":true}
