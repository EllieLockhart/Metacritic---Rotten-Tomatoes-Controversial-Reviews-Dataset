Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a much more character-driven story than its predecessor\\, just as The Empire Strikes Back was in 1980. It is also important to remember that this is Rey\u2019s story\\, not Luke\u2019s. This movie is tailored to the new main characters and what events will challenge their growths\\, and it accomplishes this better than any previous entry in the Saga. The development to Luke\u2019s character and reveal of Rey\u2019s parents are intentional choices to force her to forge her own path rather than use anybody else as a crutch. The Force Awakens showed that she was prone to making excuses to avoid making tough choices\\, but The Last Jedi was her proverbial tossing from the nest\\, and she flies so high. Finn\u2019s side mission is also much more than a diversion. His character growth is profound as he begins by trying to run from the fight (still) and ends up correcting Phasma that he is \u201cRebel scum.\u201d This is a beautiful movie that deserves at least a second viewing.","true":true}
