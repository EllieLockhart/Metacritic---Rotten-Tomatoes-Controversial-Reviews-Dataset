Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed this movie and actually believe it is the best one followed by The Empire Strikes back. Yes\\, it has its flaws\\, but what Star Wars movie doesn't. I have been a fan of the series since I was a small child\\, I am now almost 30 years old and I feel that they are going into a great direction with the films. The fan backlash is sadly the response of peoples expectations not being met and in the age of the Internet we see similar critical views similar to the release of empire\\, but amplified by mob mentality and the bandwagon effect that the Internet tends to create. I believe years from now people will look more fondly on this film for what it is\\, a new direction for the films that explores the spiritual side of Star Wars.","true":true}
