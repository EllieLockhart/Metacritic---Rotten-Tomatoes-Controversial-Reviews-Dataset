Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were about two or three scenes in TLJ that were visually nice\\, but evoked ZERO nice emotional responses for me. I feel no attachment to the characters\\, they can all die and I would not care. A good movie\/show\/anything should draw you in but the only person I have any interest in is Kylo right now. For example; Rey is like an instant fast food Jedi\\, no development. The 5 min opening scene in TFA where she is scavenging for junk with no dialog was the best for me concerning her. After that we got - \\\"We don't sell Luke happy meal any more\\, but here's the new Rey burger ready in 2 mins\\\". I can go on and on. I kinda liked Looper and Rian is prob a good guy\\, but I think he's way out of his league with this one. This is just not good story telling.?  For the 1st time in my life I'm not excited about the next chapter in a Star Wars trilogy (saw the OT in theaters AND the bad prequels).","true":true}
