Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There's a lot to complain about\\, but here goes:\\n\\nJokes felt mostly unnatural and forced. The pacing felt way too fast. Writing was dreadfully unoriginal\\, and disappointingly continues to borrow plot points from the original films. Rey shows no learning curve\\, because she doesn't need to: She always seems to be invincible\\, even without any meaningful training or understanding of the force. Rose felt like she was shoehorned in to make a hugely out-of-place point about social justice\\, and seemed to serve absolutely no purpose while she tagged around with Finn. While we're talking about her\\, why did she kiss him\\, anyway? There seems to be a stubborn refusal to take the plot in any bold direction. The scene with Leia floating back to the ship after she should have died in the (a) explosion and (b) having her blood boiled in the vacuum of space is ridiculous\\, especially when she has no familiarity with the force. I need to complain about Rose some more: She's short\\, nonathletic\\, doesn't seem to be skilled in anything\\, and has no reason to take a leading role. There were too many cliches\\, too many \\\"saved just in the nick of time\\\" scenes (Yes\\, the original movies had these\\, but not with anywhere near the same frequency). Finn shouldn't be able to challenge Phasma without any training. Chewbacca should have had more of a purpose (He should have been running around with Finn instead of Rose).\\n\\nI was young when I saw the prequels\\, so I was able to enjoy them despite them being bad movies\\, and I was able to write off The Force Awakens as being a transition to a new Star Wars plot. This film did do a few things right (Adam Driver nailed it)\\, but those were overshadowed by a host of huge\\, glaring weaknesses.","true":true}
