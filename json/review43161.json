Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This review will be spoiler free.\\n\\nI really want to like this movie. I love the Star Wars franchise and am sad to say that\\, for me\\, this is the worst movie in the saga. I had purchased tickets to 2 showings to accompany friends and family and had a 3rd viewing as a work outing. I hoped I would find something to like about it\\, but it only got worse with each viewing.\\n\\nFrom the opening moments\\, humor is overused\\, too goofy\\, and slapstick. The story feels as if it is written to be a generic sci-fi movie with a few \\\"star wars\\\" elements shoehorned in. No care seems to have been taken for internal consistency within the greater Star Wars universe\\, the other saga movies\\, or even the movie itself. Elements\\, plotlines\\, and characters from previous movies in the saga were ignored or inexplicably altered. The pacing of the entire plot is incredibly slow. All in all\\, a very disappointing movie.\\n\\nI know several people with little to no knowledge of the Star Wars universe that enjoyed the movie\\, but most of the people I know that have deeper than a surface level of understanding of the cannon were let down.
