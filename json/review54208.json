Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you are a huge Star Wars fan\\, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! Disney will ruin your childhood. As a huge Star Wars fan\\, I was let down. Disney just produced the WORST Star Wars movie of all-time! \\n\\nPeople keep talking about \\\"Originality\\\"\\, but there was nothing original about The Last Jedi. Disney decided to copy and paste exact scenes from both Empire and Return of The Jedi\\, yet people think that this piece of garbage is original? \\n\\nYes\\, maybe there were a couple of \\\"original\\\" new Jedi powers introduced\\, which was kind of cool\\, however\\, the entire plot and story was not original at all! \\n\\nThe entire movie was a complete mess! Plot was all over the place. Somehow Luke turns into this \\\"evil\\\" Jedi\\, like WHAT?!?!?! That's not the Luke who we loved and adored from the original trilogy. Who from Disney approved this piece of garbage movie? \\n\\nJust because a movie has cool visuals\\, action\\, lightsabers and space battles DOES NOT = quality. It has become clear that Disney has chosen quantity over quality. \\n\\nThe reason why I gave it 1 star rather than 0 is because there were a couple of moments throughout the movie in which it felt like a true Star Wars movie. My inner child went \\\"YES!!!!!!!\\\"\\, however\\, that only happened a few times. So\\, why wasn't the entire movie like this? \\n\\nMark Hamill was completely correct\\, if you were a true fan of the originals\\, you will be greatly disappointed! Thank you Mark Hamill for your honesty. \\n\\nDisney\\, you will not be getting any more of my money! You have failed Walt. Your cash grabbing\\, greedy and money hungry films is ruining HOLLYWOOD! \\n\\nYou have fouled me once\\, but not again!","true":true}
