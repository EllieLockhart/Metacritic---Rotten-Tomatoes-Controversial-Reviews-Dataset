Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I debated weather to write a review or not.....as many of the main reasons this film is bad has been covered time and time again...\\n\\nPoor humour...poor writing....just retcon after retcon of the force awakens...\\n\\nBut Luke's story ark was the killer for me....not just does it ruin this film but it ruins everything tht came before it for me.\\n\\nunless they remake this onscreen travesty i'm out. we had laughs we had cries i will remember you always Star Wars. but im out.","true":true}
