Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Went in expecting another amazing game by Naughty Dog and was blown away by The Last of Us Part 2. Gameplay and graphics had serious upgrades from the first game\\, encounters felt more fluid with more options to interact and ways to navigate situations\\, and the infected were less of a set-piece and actually felt like a part of the game's world. Graphics wise\\, as demonstrated by trailers\\, this game looks beautiful.\r\r*Spoiler Alert*\r\rStory wise\\, part 1\\, featuring Ellie\\, is enjoyable and her flashbacks with Joel and other people are sad and interesting to watch. Do pacing issues exist? Yeah\\, 100%\\, but for me\\, I don't think it took away from the game itself. Part 2\\, featuring Abby\\, was interesting. I didn't feel motivated to play the game for a few hours\\, but eventually\\, I started to dig into her story and enjoy it. I would say the second half of the Abby portion is more intriguing than the first half.\r\rGreat game\\, glad I bought it and purchased it\\, and highly recommend it to other people.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
