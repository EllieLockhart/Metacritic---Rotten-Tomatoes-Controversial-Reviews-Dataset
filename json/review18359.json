Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this was going to be good. I hoped it would have been better than The Force Awakens\\, which I felt\\, while still good\\, was just a remake of New Hope. The Last Jedi fails in more areas than it succeeds. The special effects and battles are amazing and epic. But the story and dialogue are broken and clunky\\, to the point it just does not feel like a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
