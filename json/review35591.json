Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a film that does not know what it wants to be. At times it wants to become a platform for political views of the director and producer. The film has no story\\, it is a film full of scenes which make no sense\\, there is no continuity whatsoever from the Force Awakens or other Star Wars movies.\\n\\nRian Johnson has ruined Star Wars. How did Disney put someone so useless at storytelling and incompetent in charge of such a well known franchise; it's like Disney thought\\, \\\"let's waste billions on a franchise so we can sit back and kill it for fun\\\".","true":true}
