Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson shouldn't be allowed to touch a per-established franchise\\, he sacrifieced continuity and lore and legacy that took 40 years to build\\, for the sake of \\\"telling his own story\\\" which is in every aspect mediocre. The Marvel level humour\\, the plot twists that make no sense and add nothing to the story\\, the forced political correctness themes\\, the plot holes and the lack of character evolution makes this movie the worst entry in the franchise so far. \\nHis directorial talent is there\\, his good intentions to innovate are visible\\, but his writing and choices for an established lore are mediocre.","true":true}
