{"101487":147653,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would have to say \\\"Last Jedi\\\" is the worst one out of the whole series.  Slipshod story telling.  Bad jokes and too many of those.  The new characters are not very interesting\\, esp. Rey.  To me\\, she's *too* \\\"Mary Sue\\\".  I have yet to see her fail at anything.  Flaws make for a good character and Rey has none.  Also\\, I'm not too fond of Daisy Ridley's portrayal of this character.  Poe seems to be relegated to being a great pilot\\, but emasculated out of the cockpit.  Finn....I still don't know about him.  Every time you think he's going to go one way\\, he goes the other.  Very confusing.  And if Kylo is supposed to be a bad guy\\, he's not bad enough.  He's not charismatic or imposing enough to take seriously.  His redemption in ep. 9\\, if there is one\\, will seem lackluster and possibly pointless. \\nBut\\, one thing I did like out of \\\"Last Jedi\\\" was Luke.  A lot of people hated what Rian Johnson did to him\\, but I totally get it.  He had a moment in his life where he was going to do something he would have regretted (killing Kylo Ren).  I think that got to him so much\\, he felt like he needed to exile himself because it went against everything of who he was.","true":true}
