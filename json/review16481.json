Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm surprised this movie got a lot of hate. I've been a fan of Rian Johnson and Star Wars for a long time\\, and was excited when I heard that he would be doing one movie part of one of my childhood franchises. I loved the plot\\, screenplay\\, action scenes and the way Rian handled the characters. But\\, I was disappointed about the revelation of Rey's parents. I did expect more\\, but that just makes us wait for answers in Star Wars 9 (if it will be answered then).","true":true}
