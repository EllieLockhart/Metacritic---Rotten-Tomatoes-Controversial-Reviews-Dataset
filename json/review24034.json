Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mark hamill said it all \\\"LUKE WOULD NEVER DO\/SAY THAT\\\"\\nThe director doesn't know what star wars is... this is a sci-fi action adventure. Star wars is the ultimate battle between good and evil\\, light and dark. NOT AN ACTION MOVIE!","true":true}
