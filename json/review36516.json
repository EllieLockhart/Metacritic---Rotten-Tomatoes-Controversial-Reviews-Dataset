Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie didn't feel like Star Wars\\, some bad jokes\\, and bad writing pulled me out of the movie. This lead to useless characters\\, plot lines and sacrifice in the movie.","true":true}
