Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was absolute garbage. And it's not even about the stupid politics. That didn't even start bothering me until 3 or 4 days later when it got tiresome listening to all the fans endlessly talking about it and blaming my dislike of the film on politics. No.. the film was just crap. It was boring. The characters all sucked. What they did to Luke was unforgivable. They destroyed everything set up in The Force Awakens which itself wasn't even a good film but it was a lot better than this trainwreck. After near 40 years of loving Star Wars this film has single handedly destroyed every positive feeling I had left for this franchise. I am not interested in Solo. I will not go see episode 9. That's how bad it was.","true":true}
