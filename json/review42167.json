Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie ruins the character of Luke Skywalker and has some of the corniest\\, most ridiculous scenes since the prequels. Terrible writing and pacing throughout. I can\u2019t believe that this is the movie they gave us after Force Awakens. The Last Jedi feels like a massive disrespect to Star Wars fans\\, and is honestly not a good movie in general. Mark Hamill tried to warn us. Thanks a lot Disney\/Rian Johnson. ","true":true}
