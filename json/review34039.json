Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible work here. Seems like Ryan J. actually tried his worse to make the fandom feel miserable while watching this piece of garbage. Critics say is good just to push their own political ideologies which don't fit into SW. After watching this movie and with all my sorrow I find myself quiting SW for good. This marks the death of the franchise. No storytelling. No character development. No seriousness. No epicness. The movie is dumb and long. Turning painful to watch.","true":true}
