Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So terrible i think it gave me cancer.  Star Wars is dead now.  Terrible film.  Social engineering disguised as vacuous dialog\\, wrapped in cgi and iced with terrible acting. Dont see this film unless as an act of penance.","true":true}
