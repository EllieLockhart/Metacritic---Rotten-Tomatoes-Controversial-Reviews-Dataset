Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked it a lot. I'm a SW fan but not a super fan. I never read any of the books or played the video games. This movie looked great\\, sounded amazing\\, had great acting\\, great action scenes and was funny.  Perfect 5\/7","true":true}
