Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I learned a very valuable lesson today\\, from a hugely disappointing rip-off film that was a complete drag.\\n\\n\\\"Strike me down\\, and I will always be with you - just like your father.\\\"\\n\\nVengeance can never beat Forgiveness.\\n\\nStill\\, it is just...bad.\\n\\nI can't forgive that.\\n\\nAnd of course the critics loved this movie\\, it is just one huge feminist\\, man-hating piece of total crap.?\\n\\nI wasn't entertained by the Star Wars: The Last Jedi.\\n\\nA huge letdown.","true":true}
