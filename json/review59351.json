The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The Last Of Us's strength was derived primarily from the relationship forged between Ellie and Joel; everything else was secondary. Somehow\\, TLOU Part 2 seems astoundingly unaware of this. Joel's death\\, although potentially a fine decision either later in the game or in a subsequent sequel\\, was a poor choice that immediately massively negatively impacted the game. Having to play as Abby during the first few hours\\, with it being very clear that she was going to kill Joel\\, was a devastatingly bad move\\, and I found myself letting her get caught by the zombies in a hopeless bid to spare Joel.\r\rCharacter development was disappointingly poor. Ellie became a character that\\, by the end\\, I actually hated more than Abby. Her disregard for the welfare of her friends and her girlfriend paints a character who is deeply selfish\\, psychopathic\\, and not fun to play as: when I play a game\\, I don't want to feel like a bad person. I didn't want to make the decisions the game forced me to make\\, and when the game finally ended\\, after several false stops\\, I was left feeling desolate and depressed\\, with the one silver lining being that it was finally over. For the first time in my life i immediately uninstalled the game\\, gave my dog a hug\\, and traded the game in. I had no desire to play this game again\\, given how it made me feel.\r\rThe game certainly isn't all bad; indeed there are some fantastic parts (such as the level set in the outbreak 'ground zero')\\, the score works very well\\, and fine detail is great (such as the weapon modification animations)\\, however the negatives outshine the positives. Dialogue was weak\\, with too much spoken explicitly and too little relying on nuance\\, and many things that occurred seemed to have been written just so the story could continue in the direction of the ending the writers wanted. Different parts feel disjointed\\, much of it feels disorganised\\, and some parts are far too long and boring. The degree of graphic violence was genuinely shocking\\, exhausting and entirely unneccessary\\, and I found myself having to look away from quite a few parts (I felt sorry for the animators). Perhaps most importantly\\, having to play the game as a character you are inevitably going to have little rapport with due to her actions in the first few hours was a gamble that did not pay off. Although I ended up favouring Abby\\, it wasn't because I felt sorry for her per se\\, but rather because I hated her just a little bit less than the monster Ellie had become.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
