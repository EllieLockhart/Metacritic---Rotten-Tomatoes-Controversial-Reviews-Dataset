Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson either has no clear understanding of the characters or does not care for them. The only one he seems to have taken seriously is Kylo Ren - the rest are an out of character mess\\, including the heroes of The Force Awakens and even Luke Skywalker. The plot is weak to say the least\\, some of the conflicts are entirely unnecessary (Holdo..)\\, the twists are unexpected because they make no sense and lack proper build-up and reasoning. Jokes are tasteless and plain cruelty is often staged as humour. Even though the action never stops\\, not a lot actually happen that advances the story\\, and instead of resolving problems and answering questions Johnson simply tosses them aside.  It is a massively disappointing follow-up to episode VII.","true":true}
