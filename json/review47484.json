Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What is good about The Last Jedi is great and great as in the best of the franchise. The bad? Not nearly as bad as the worst which is most of the prequels. For me it was a tale of two halves. The first half of Last being meh\\, featuring a lot of odd choices and clunky humor. The second is perhaps the most exciting\\, clever and original of the entire series. Not sure where the hate is coming from because the the 3rd week audience I saw it with went bananas for it. Lots of enthusiastic applauses at the end and cheers through out. Can't wait to see it again.","true":true}
