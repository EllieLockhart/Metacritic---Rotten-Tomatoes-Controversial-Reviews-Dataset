Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best film I have ever seen.  I loved the characters Luke Skywalker and the big bear who flew the spaceship.  I think the little green man with the walking stick deserves an Oscar for his role.  Awesome movie fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Yassssssss!!!","true":true}
