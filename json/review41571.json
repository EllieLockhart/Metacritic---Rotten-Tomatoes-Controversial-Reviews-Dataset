Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is flawed from an both intellectual and practical standpoint. It's basically the same plot as episode 5. This movie presents a weak criticism of capitalism; this is coming from an anti-capitalist socialist. The forced feminist themes were a too little obvious. I did like Admiral Holdo and Captain Phasma.  Unfortunatly\\, they were both killed in pointless ways. Starwars 8 managed to be both boring and intellectually insulting. The forced humor was clearly intended to keep the drunk idiots in the front row from talking throughout the entire movie. The action scenes and plot twists were so bad that audience members laughed throughout many of the serious dialogue scenes.","true":true}
