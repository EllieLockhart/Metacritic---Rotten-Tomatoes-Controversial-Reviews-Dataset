Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to like this movie. But aside from 3 or 4 visually appeasing scenes the creators absolutely destroyed any momentum they had going forward from the force awakens. It took about a day of thinking about this movie but I am actually quite angry to what they did to Luke. The one thing I hoped they would not do is make the strongest Jedi in the known galaxy a useless Whiney weeble who is to busy feeing sorry for himself to be of any use. They completely ignored the potential of all their main characters for some misplaced light hearted PG humor. I gave 1.5 stars for the visuals. The rest was Garbage and I'm planning on watching the rest of the franchise from home when it's free. The movie is long\\, confusing and depressing. I mean for Petes sake the first Thor movie is more fun to watch than this. ","true":true}
