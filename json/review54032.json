Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't\\, for the life of me\\, understand how critics and some fans \\\"loved\\\" this movie and claimed that it took the franchise in \\\"bold and new directions\\\". The story and plot are all over the place and when you ask why are these characters acting like this\\, Johnson's answer is \\\"shhh\\, because the plot wills it so\\\". We go from (1) Poe and the Resistance\\, to (2) Kylo and Rey\\, to (3) Rey and Luke\\, (4) Finn and Rose and back again. Those 20-25 mins spent on Canto Bight should've been spent on the growing dynamic between Kylo & Rey and the mentoring process going on with Luke and Rey. Time spent on Ach-To and the Force Link between Kylo and Rey was the most interesting part of this movie. Everything else\\, from the god awful Marvel-esque style humor\\, to the social talking points spoon fed to us by the new characters and blatant de-characterization on one of cinemas most iconic characters (ie Luke Skywalker)\\, is why I cannot love or even like TLJ as a Star Wars movie. In a vacuum\\, it's borderline great. But knowing that it is the 8th film in a 40 year old franchise with tons of lore and set rules\\, TLJ holds the last place out of all the Star Wars films.","true":true}
