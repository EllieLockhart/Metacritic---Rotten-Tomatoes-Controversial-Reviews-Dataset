Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really liked this.  I can see the problems that others may point out\\, but most of those are small to none.  The problem is that people aren't expecting a good movie when they see Star Wars\\, they're expecting something better than what is humanly possible in most cases and don't have an open mind.  As a movie\\, this is marvelous.  Is it the best Star Wars film?  No.  Is it good?  Yes.  Does it deserve an audience rating equal to such a bad movie as Daddy's Home 2?  Never.","true":true}
