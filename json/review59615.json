We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Great game people only given hate because of a death of a character and how it happens then scoring it a 0 mark basically not taken into account the graphics\\, character design\\, voice acting\\, lighting\\, and story which is for the most part sad and depressing. But beautiful and masterful in a way its told and plays on you're emotions good and bad make a great peace of art and is what i look for in games\\, TV shows and movies.\r\rIf this game didn't kill Joel then the haters would call it a masterpiece or if it was a whole new game they would call it the same. me personally i just could not relate to Abby because of what she did that's why a 9\/10 but the rest of the game is awesome and violent which i love.\r\rThe fake reviews the game is getting on review site are disgraceful because people come to these site to look for a game to play by reading people honest opinions not fake ones saying that the game is a 0\\, 1\\, 2\\, 3 or 4 out of 10 just because a character dies in a violent way and you're not telling them all other parts of the game like design\\, graphics and all other aspects of the game. It was the same with Death Stranding and Spiderman\\, no puddle i need to cry and cancel my pre-order WOW.\r\rIt make me ashamed to be called a gamer how you can just turn on a company you admire and say you love.\r\rYOU ARE A DISGRACE TO GAMER'S EVERYWHERE AND NEED TO GROW UP.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
