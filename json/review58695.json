Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This Game will probably be one of my favorite games of 2020. Now I'm not saying this game is better than the first game. But\\, it is still really Amazing. Ellie story is done in my opinion a well done way. Everything from the flashback to the ending made sense to me. Now the only critic I had for this game was that we play as Abby. To me I understand why we play as Abby because there are two sides to every coin but\\, I wish her story would have been cut down to make room for Ellie's story instead. Or better yet make her story a cutscene based story happening while Ellie story is happening. Another thing I see people complaining about is the ending and I get that but it makes sense. During the prologue Joel sings to Ellie before giving her the guitar. He states that \\\" If I ever were to lose you. I'd surely lose myself.\\\" To me that is exactly what happened to Ellie. We see at the beginning of the story that Ellie is just trying to live a normal life the best she can. But\\, when Joel dies that world is shattered. When she deals with all the people that helped kill Joel you see she starts to break down because of some of the actions she took. Then we finally track down Abby again where we have our last fight. WHen she is about to kill Abby I believe when she sees Joel she realises that if she countinuess she will lose herself. She will be no better than Abby was. Risking her friends lives just to get revenge. When she returns to Her and Dinas farm\\, Dina and JJ are not there. She even tries to play the song Joel sang to her during the prologue but she is unable to since she lost her ring and pinky finger to Abby in their last fight. She truly did lose herself but she came back from it. Then we see Ellie put her guitar down and we see her walking away from the house from the window hopefully heading back to Jackson to possibly reunite with Dina and JJ. It makes sense that Ellie after everything finally realises that she did lose herself and now she is on a path to regain the person she once was. This ending to me made sense and was actually a fitting end to the story. This game was not perfect but\\, I don't believe it should receive all the hate it's getting. If you loved the first game I Highly Recommend that you get this game as well. This is definitely another top notch game by NaughtyDog.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
