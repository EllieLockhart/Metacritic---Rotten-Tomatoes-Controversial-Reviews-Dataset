Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars film ever. What a disgrace to Luke Skywalker! No plot. Over the top CGI. No character development. It's Phantom Menace 2.0... Indiana Jones was ruined with Crystal Skull...now Star Wars is gone down in flames. How could they allow this to happen!!!","true":true}
