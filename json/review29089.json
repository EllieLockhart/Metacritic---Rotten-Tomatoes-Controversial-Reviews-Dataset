Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really not all that impressive.  Visuals and music are stunning\\, but plot seems to plod along at times and lacks tension.  Just left me wanting to see more (but not in a good way).  Too many good characters or concepts ended prematurely.  Still better than J.J. Star Wars - A New Hope II.","true":true}
