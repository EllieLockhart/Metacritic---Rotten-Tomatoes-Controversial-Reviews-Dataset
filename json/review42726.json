Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was great if you like movies like San Andreas . The main evil guy is so weak . Everything about this movie is terrible. I liked the first movie and even Rogue One . This movie was all over the place . New outfits to make money . Rey should of turned evil and killed the dark lord and everyone . Last scene she cold of gotten in a fight with lLuke and got disfigured and killed him on top of the island and I would of been happy with it . This movie is just to Disney like . They have ruined the Star Wars theme . I have never been more disappointed in a movie ever . Hole family hated it . What a waste of my time and money .","true":true}
