Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was fine it just felt rush as if they were trying to be so different it lost its sense of story telling. They needed to answer the question of why instead of just keeping it vague.","true":true}
