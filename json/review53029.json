{"101487":105359,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-07-10","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a person who grew up with Star Wars\\, I was 6 when the original movie came out and still have all of my original toys from the 70's and 80's\\, I was hopeful for this trilogy and really looking forward to it. The Force Awakens setup and amazing possible storyline for several characters\\, but the Last Jedi just failed in every way imaginable. You never give all control to just one guy\\, especially someone who has no clue about the Star Wars legacy. This movie failed in so many ways it's hard to count them all. Mainly Rey's parents could have been epic\\, but was an utter disappointment and let down\\, who Spoke was and where came from\\, another complete let down and a huge hole left to explain. Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy failed at this movie and I am afraid will continue to fail if left in charge of. Star Wars is a space opera based around the Skywalker family\\, all 6 movies so far were based on that\\, they took the most optimistic character Luke Skywalker \\\"A New Hope\\\" and turned him into a pathetic loser. We could have seen or had a great experience seeing Luke Skywalker being the true Jedi master he is\\, but we got was the total opposite and a joke to be honest. And flying Liea was painful to watch\\, any person\\, including Jedi's would die instantly upon entering space unprotected\\, past Jedi's died as they did in Revenge of the Sith\\, but some how Liea survives\\, I don't buy it. So thank you Disney for ruining one of the greatest movies\\, franchises and stories ever told. Great job!","true":true}
