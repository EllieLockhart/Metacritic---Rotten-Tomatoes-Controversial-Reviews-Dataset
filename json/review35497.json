{"101487":175056,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi had a lot to live up to\\, but did fall flat at times. The Force Awakens and Rogue One were tough acts to follow\\, but Last Jedi did a decent job. I definitely wanted more\\, but this was a good movie with some amazing scenes and characters. And a special shout-out to the \\\"lightspeed\\\" scene... that was visually the most breathtaking moment of any Star Wars movie.","true":true}
