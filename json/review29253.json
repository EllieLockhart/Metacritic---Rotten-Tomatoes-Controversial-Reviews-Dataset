{"101487":164912,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Review of Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\n\\nSo\\, the new Star Wars movie is out. People have seen it. The cat is out of the bag. So how is it? How does it stack up? Did Rian Johnson ruin the up and coming Trilogy? While I won't bore you with the Plot\\, which can be summed up on Wikipedia at\\, https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Star_Wars:_The_Last_Jedi#Plot\\, I wanted to lay out some of my thoughts.\\n\\nSo this is our \\\"Empire Strikes Back\\\" of the new Trilogy\\, but it doesn't quite feel that way. While the film overall has some strong points\\, so many plot points feel rushed or unexplained enough to carry weight. The net result is still positive\\, it is on the low end of that scale. In summary\\, we have a Rebel fleet fleeing from The First Order after blowing up Starkiller Base\\, and a hopeful Rey seeking Training from Luke.\\n\\nStrengths:\\n\\n* Visuals\\n* Actor performances\\n* Some insight into the origins of the Jedi Order\\n\\nWeaknesses:\\n\\n* Poor plot progression and design\\n* Disjointed\\n* Under developed characters\\n* Feels rushed and forced (no pun intended)\\n* Too many things squeezed into one movie\\n\\nThe Characters:\\n\\nRey\\n\\nWe see and witness some good pieces of the origins of the Jedi Order\\, but the mysticism isn't fully laid out\\, nor do we understand fully how Rey becomes who she is at the end of the film\\, given the lack of detail laid out in her \\\"training sessions.\\\" This  leaves quite a hole in her character storyline and impact. While the Force Awakens gives you a good starting point with Rey\\, and opens some questions\\, those are neight fully answered\\, or those that are (her parents) are disappointing. I feel her time on Ahch-To with Luke deserved much more attention. \\n\\nInstead\\, we see Rey getting a few \\\"pro-tips\\\" from Luke\\, a glimpse of the Jedi Order's origins\\, and a bizzare and confusing trip to the \\\"Dark Side\\,\\\" in a cavern that tries to mimic Luke's trial on Dagobah in Empire. Rey\\, frustrated with Luke after learning what happened with Kylo and Luke's Jedi temple\\, leaves the planet to put her hope in Kylo turning to the Light Side. Rey's character ends up in a limbo at the end of the film\\, with this strange acceleration to almost full on Jedi and she is lined up to be our main protagonist with Luke passing away.\\n\\nKylo\\n\\nKylo's performance was pretty good\\, but his scenes of deception and struggle with the Light Side playing well into his scenes. The plot twist of killing Snoke and assuming power as disappointing\\, short\\, and rushed. In the end though\\, he should server as a good antagonist into Episode 9.\\n\\nSnoke\\n\\nSnoke was one of the most disappointing characters. He was completely rushed. No backstory was truly given\\, and his demise left you feeling betrayed as a fan. It's as almost as if he didn't matter. He was no \\\"Emperor.\\\" To be fair\\, we didn't know too much about The Emperor in the original trilogy at first\\, but the original trilogy did a good job at building up his character to a position of meaning. Snoke goes out like a chump with little exposition on how he even got there in the first place or his place in things. \\n\\nLuke\\n\\nLuke's performance was overall pretty good. While he \\\"wussed out\\\" quite a bit over training Rey\\, he had good reason to\\, and it makes sense given the prior events with his Jedi temple. It was interesting to learn of Luke's struggles with training a new generation of Jedi\\, and that the Jedi Order as a structure is meaningless. The Jedi Order does not have to exist\\, it is not a prerequisite for balance of The Force.\\n\\nThe throwback scenes with Luke tying into the old trilogy were nice\\, especially the one with R2D2 and Leia's message to Obi-Wan. Hopefully this wasn't lost on younger audiences. Ultimately though\\, Luke's finale scene with Kyle felt short\\, while being great to watch. The decision to end Luke's mortal presence by astral-projecting from his sanctuary felt a bit cheap. He deserved much better\\, given his lineage\\, lore\\, and place in the overall Star Wars saga.\\n\\nSupporting Characters\\n\\nFinn and Poe get some decent scenes. While Finn is woefully under supported in his role in this film\\, he has his moments. It felt as if they treated Finn less of a central figure\\, and more of just \\\"some guy.\\\" On the other hand\\, Poe has some good moments with blasting and shooting\\, despite the treatment he got on the main Rebel cruiser.\\n\\nChewbacca has some alright scenes\\, and a good laugh with the Porg creatures watching him attempt to eat one of their own. While his screen time is short\\, is isn't bad. We also get introduced to Rose\\, which is an alright character. Captain Phasma goes down like a chump after a decent hand-to-hand fight (see: Boba Fett in Return of the Jedi). Han's death also gets little attention\\, beyond a pair of gold dice\\, which was disappointing.\\n\\nOverall Impressions\\n\\nWhile I enjoyed the film\\, it was different\\, and felt as if it went off in a different direction than Force Awakens. Directed by Rian Johnson this time\\, one can hope the underdeveloped plot and lack of meaningful progression of trilogy is saved by J.J. Abrams in episode 9. I'm now surprised that Disney thought this film was so good that they handed him the reigns to do a new trilogy. This does to show the strange lack of focus Disney has in some aspects to the newer Star Wars universe.  We still end up with a strong First Order and weak Resistance. I hope this is aimed at setting up some kind of uprising for The Resistance in the next film.\\n\\nWill the film stand up well over time? I am leaning towards no\\, but it is not a terrible movie. It has a lot more potential for sure\\, but it has its moments. As a Star Wars fan\\, i'll give it pass\\, but marginally so. I'm sure those who read the comics and books were even harder on the movie.  \\n\\nAs one of my favorite movie quotes is written\\, \\\"I'm not mad\\, I'm just disappointed.\\\"","true":true}
