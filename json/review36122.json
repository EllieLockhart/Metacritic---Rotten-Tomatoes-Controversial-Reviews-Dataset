Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was amazing! I said that about The Force Awakens too but I think this one was better! It was action packed the whole way through and I couldn\u2019t stop watching. I was not let down. I\u2019m very excited to see how the story ends in the final movie. ","true":true}
