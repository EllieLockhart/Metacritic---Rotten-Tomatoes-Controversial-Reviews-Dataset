Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly\\, this  movie made me love again the old times of George Lucas and the whole prequel saga. I was always a big Star Wars Fan and I was\\, actually\\, keen on seeing this flick. However\\, I came out lectured on gender politics and animal abuse and the rich eating the poor... what the heck went SO WRONG? Why has it to be SO progressive-political? Some scenes were outright embarrassing. I truely felt cheated on Luke Skywalker after the heavy build up in TFA... but it does not stop there. There was a drop of climax everywhere imaginable. Biggest of all: the end of Snoke\/Phasma. What was Phasma about anyway?!? I never thought I would say that\\, since I was a child but... I am honestly not interested in this franchise anymore. After all old charaters died I do not feel enough attached to Mary Sue Rey or Finn or the rest of the bunch I don't even remember the names of. I have no interest in the next installment anymore. Happy hyping.","true":true}
