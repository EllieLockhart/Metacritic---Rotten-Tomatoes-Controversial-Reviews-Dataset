Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was hard for me to watch. It was hard to See how the three original hero's had such tragic endings to their lives. I wish Luke Skywalker had a more stoic impact on Rey during the film. Fortunately he had a nice ending moment fans like me were craving\\, however I think it was a little too late. It's sad to see how Ben Solo ruined the three hero's lives. It was real and authentic\\, however it was very sad and somber to watch. \\n\\nI did like the story of Rey and Kylo and how they killed Snoke and broke off in different directions.  Brilliantly done.  Finally\\, I don't understand the Rose character and why we had to know soon much about her and her sister. It felt like a Touge One plot that didn't belong in this trilogy.","true":true}
