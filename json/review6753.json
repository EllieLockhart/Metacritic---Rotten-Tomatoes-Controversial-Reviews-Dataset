Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't listen to the crybabies - this is a PROPER Star Wars film. Anyone with any taste\\, anyone who was alive in the 80s\\, anyone who wasn't loaded up with expectations and predictions\\, will enjoy the shit out of this. It jettisons some of the sub-plots and uninspired ideas from TFA\\, and practically starts afresh with a little cheeky wink from Johnson straight from the off. Luke's character has changed\\, inevitably\\, as would anyone who's been through what he has\\, and been living in isolation for so long. And Mark Hamill absolutely nails it. It's also a film that is a beautiful\\, powerful send off for both Carrie Fisher and the character of Princess Leia. Emotional. Big time. The humour is perhaps a little too unsubtle\\, but always funny. There is a perfect\\, 'Star Wars' esque balance between cute and weird creatures\\, exotic locales\\, space battles\\, emotionally resonant characters and story arcs\\, and an overarching mythological frame that is so important to Star Wars. It's also an amazing feat that Johnson kept the pace manageable\\, and coherent\\, across what is an epic space opera with grand scale. It's a magical film\\, full of warmth\\, and if you didn't like it\\, you really are having a shitty winter\\, and need to try it again when you've cheered up again. It's fucking good.","true":true}
