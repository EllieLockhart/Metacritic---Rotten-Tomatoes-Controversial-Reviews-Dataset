Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"it was a snooze fest till the last 30 min.  Seriously this was terrible movie with so much potential. who the hell is Snoak ?? where is the back story ?  and why \\, why is it that every male Jedi character have to earn the title of jedi shown training and earning that title... but first female protagonist in a trilogy and she just gets handed the Jedi title.... oh because woman","true":true}
