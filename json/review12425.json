Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I came to the theater a few minutes late\\, and the first thing I saw was the crank call from Poe to Hux.  As I took my seat\\, I couldn't believe that this is a Star Wars movie.  Lucas' prequels had quite a bit of infantile and idiotic comedy\\, but this went beyond the pale\\, and it presaged how bad the rest of the film turned out to be.  It was a lazy\\, clumsy\\, ideologically-charged script that deliberately ignored the Star Wars canon and most of all\\, logic.  Rian Johnson's focus\\, it seems\\, was the oft-quoted \\\"subversion of expectations\\\" and moronic comic relief.  There is no rhyme nor reason for much what happens in this movie\\, potentially brilliant characters like Rey\\, Luke\\, Finn\\, or Poe are completely wasted\\, and the final episode of the trilogy is set to fail in terms of storyline\\, because of continuous need to fix the multiple messes that Johnson had made in TLJ.  Speaking of which\\, it's clear that there was no plan for a story arc binding the three films.  Disney is flying by the seat of their pants\\, and no one is willing to admit that giving full creative control over to Rian Johnson was a colossal mistake that this franchise will never recover from.  So long Star Wars\\, it's been progressively worse since the Phantom Menace\\, and TLJ put the final nail in the coffin.  I won't be there for any more of these wretched films; have a blockbuster December 2019 opening night without me.","true":true}
