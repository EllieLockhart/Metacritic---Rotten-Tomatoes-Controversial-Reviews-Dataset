Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really baffled by any strong dislike for this.  Not your favorite?  I can buy that\\, but anything else feels like misplaced anger the likes of which we didn't even see with some of the prequels.","true":true}
