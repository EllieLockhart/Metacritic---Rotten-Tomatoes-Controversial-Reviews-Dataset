The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"if they rearrange some parts and fix others... it could be a masterpiece.. like change the parts of Abby to the start of the game\\, TO TRY\\, AT LEAST TRY\\, to get people to feel sympathetic to her... put more chemistry between Diana and Ellie\\, about the teenage stuff of weed... was a little CRINGEY but okay? I feel like this game was way too mainstream and that's why is soo divided\\, they wanted to put stuff that some people didn't like... and put stuff that other people like. The people giving negative reviews actually liked some parts of the game (like the parts with Joel)... but not the complete game\\, that's why you have to be open minded to play this game\\, this game isn't made for old fans... or even new fans... it's trying to be in the middle... and you can tell that in a lot of parts in the game.\r\rAbby and Ellie makes a lot of bad choices.. and you the player feel that.. but you can't control any of it. It's like you are watching your character do bad actions and you command them to do those actions... without even a choice\\, uninstall the game or play it. The game make you feel miserable because of that\\, you are punished because of an action you didn't even had a choice of\\, makes you kill a dog\\, and play with the same dog with Abby. Yeah!! make the player control someone that they hate to fight the character they love... awesome!\r\rHow I'm supposed to feel sympathetic to Abby? because of a thing that happened in the first minutes of the game\\, everything you throw at me won't work... she is not a bad character\\, but I mean.. the game forces you to hate her and forces you to try.... un-hate her?\r\rAbby just don't even try to understand why Ellie is so triggered and doesn't fell bad that she killed Joel... the character that we loved and liked died with a slow and cruel death\\, because Joel deserved\\, because he killed her father?\r(her father accepted to kill the child of someone to save the world\\, but disregarded to accept to kill his own child to save the world)\r\rThe sex scene... really?????? at this point I just felt that this game is trying so much... SO MUCH to say I'M DIFFERENT! LOOK AT ME PLEASE!!!\r\rThe game is trying to say that revenge is bad\\, but it just doesn't make sense Ellie do revenge in the first point\\, and they try to justify that making her change... in the last second? why didn't she stayed with Diana in the first place? actually why didn't you just stayed put Ellie? because of the plot\\, if Ellie didn't wanted revenge then this game would not exist.... JOEL DIDN'T WANTED YOU TO DO THAT ELLIE! and i knew that from the start.. now you can't play guitar\\, the thing that connected you with him.. and saved the person that caused all that. Abby would die naturally... what was the point Ellie? seriously? what you are trying to prove?\r\rThis is not The Last of Us\\, it just doesn't fit in a single bit... this is a completely different game\\, with completely different characters\\, and completely different meaning. With that in mind you will for sure.. love this game and give it a 10\/10 rating.\r\rBut if you think this is The Last of Us 2\\, only disappointment will come to you.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
