Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unbelievable plot holes and left me and the 4 friends that saw it feeling robbed by lost chances and unexplained plot limes. TIme spent weaving a new mythology in the first film just dropped. Im stunned that critics like this film\\, perhaps they judge it as a Christmas holiday block buster\\, better that transformers and the Mummy so lets give it a big thumbs up but to starwars fans this is a very disappointing outing. I want to outline the pile of errors\\, plot holes\\, dropped chances but they are all spoilers . I have Rogue one to hold onto ... thats something and hopefully 'Solo' will be another cracking film to help paper over this lost cause","true":true}
