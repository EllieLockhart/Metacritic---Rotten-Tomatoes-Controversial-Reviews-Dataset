Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just need to add my personal impression to this movie\\, because Star Wars was (not \\\"is\\\" anymore) an epic fantasy saga with a lot of humanity and focused on characters.\\nNow it is just some forgettable Marvelish Avengerish useless movie.\\nWait\\, some of those movies are actually good\\, but overall they are not at all close to any Star Wars movie\\, but this.\\nPlot is very\\, very bad. \\nEverything \\\"good\\\" in the movie is just a predictable copy-paste from the first trilogy. The new things are just horrible and make no sense.\\nI could go deeper into details\\, but I feel it would be wasted time for this garbage.\\nI had fun watching this\\, because I was with friends and we were actually enjoying laughing at every crap proposed. But then I slept over this and woken up just angry.\\nDislaimer: I am not at all an hater of any sort. I just like good things. This movie wasn't AND ruined the saga.","true":true}
