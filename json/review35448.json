Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi does everything right and even goes beyond as it breaks so many boundaries in the Star Wars saga\\, and is not scared of making choices. The movie provides twists and turns never seen before in this star wars franchise. The actors of this franchise once again provide great performance from old and new faces\\, but the Performance that stood out the most was Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker. This is the best we've seen Luke Skywalker in the 5 movies hes been in and that is magnificaent\\, Definetly go and see this movie as soon as possible","true":true}
