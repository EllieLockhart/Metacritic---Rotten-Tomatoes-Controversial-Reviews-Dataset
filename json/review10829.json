Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Has its flaws\\, but enjoyable and worthwhile .  Probably only deserves a 4 out 5 but seems like there are so many 0's and 1's dragging this score down that need to make up for it.  Have not met or spoken to anyone that actually hates it\\,  seems like there are just a bunch of trolls out there hating on it with faulty logic.","true":true}
