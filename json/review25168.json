Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"New characters with no actual character replaces the old favorites. The plot is holier then the pope. It is also stupid. Overall a complete failure considering the low bar people were willing to accept for a Star Wars film.","true":true}
