Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would give this movie 0 stars if they counted it in the rating.  This movie completely strays from what Star Wars has been and what it should be.  The plot is horribly designed and only seeks to destroy anything created by previous movies.  Rian Johnson completely ruins what Luke's character used to be and what is signifies.  Rose is completely useless to the plot and is only there to push SW propaganda.  The decisions that are made in this movie completely contradict the force and everything Star Wars.  It is a disgrace and should be removed from Canon.","true":true}
