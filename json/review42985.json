Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was terrible. Possibly the worse among the entire trilogy. No plot\\, no decent characters\\, and too many crappy jokes I mean yeah Marvel did it but that was because the superheroes already looked stupid so they had an excuse to add in funny\/crappy jokes between serious clips of their films while The last Jedi... I mean just wow... I'm gonna stop this review only because of all the fanboys\\n of this film that comes on here saying it's good... They don't know what a good movie is then.","true":true}
