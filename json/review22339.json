Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Last Jedi was a bomb! It bombed my last hope (the spark has gone out!) for the future of the Star Wars universe. As far as I'm concerned there is no need for further sequels because:\\n1. Abrams is coming back to administer the killing blow for Episode 9\\, \\n2. Rey's mysterious past is a dead end (every pun intended) and \\n3. The big villainous cheese was killed off! \\nI truly went into ep 8 with the hopes that it would be tons better than ep 7 but alas I was wrong and it is now time for Star Was to end!","true":true}
