Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don\u2019t understand the fan revolt on this. I think this is a terrific movie. I grew up on the original trilogy - my first movie I remember was Star Wars in a drive in theater. While I don\u2019t like what they did with Luke\\, I love the movie & the new characters. Just go enjoy with an open mind.","true":true}
