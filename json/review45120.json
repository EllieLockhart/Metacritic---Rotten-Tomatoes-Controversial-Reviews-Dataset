Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unforgivable treatment of Star Wars mythology. Effects are amazing though. No respect for TFA. Story arch (space chase) stupid. So many plot holes. The whole thing is drowning in politicised sauce. Looper was a bad story with multiple plot holes. I fear his upcoming trilogy will be similar.","true":true}
