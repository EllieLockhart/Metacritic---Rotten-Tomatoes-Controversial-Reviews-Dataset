Extremely violent without meaning. Some scenes where almost copied right out of the SAW series... The story makes no sense to me as a fan of this and similar games. It seems to me that the creator just wanted to create controversy and sell the game through that. Why is beyond me since it is a popular title\/genre anyway. A very wrong commercial move inUnfortunately a great disappointment. Extremely violent without meaning. Some scenes where almost copied right out of the SAW series... The story makes no sense to me as a fan of this and similar games. It seems to me that the creator just wanted to create controversy and sell the game through that. Why is beyond me since it is a popular title\/genre anyway. A very wrong commercial move in my point of view.\rTo sum up:\rGameplay: 4\/10 - Copy-Paste from the previous game +\/- some very tiny details. Be warned the game has a very slow pace in many parts. You might get a little annoyed\\, tired or bored...\rStory: 1\/10 - Very socio\/political agenda oriented. Not focusing to the games main issue\/story. Builds new unwanted characters and stops the development of existing ones. The games derails from the main goal very soon and puts the player on a grudge track.... I thought we were trying to save the world not **** about personal issues here... i guess i was wrong.\rGraphics: 4\/10 as expected for a 2020 game but nothing spectacular. GoW\/the last couple of ACs and Uncharted 4 are on par with this game when it comes to graphics. Beautiful yes but nothing really revolutionary. Also very very dark... i don't know why. Maybe to push the whole dark theme. And unfortunately with dark themes in graphics you can hide a lot of detail or not use time to develop them at all..\rSoundtrack: 2\/10. Dark to the borderline of depressing\\, FX not as good as similar other games.\rOverall : 1\/10. I wanted to give it a better score but because of the great expectations it was a huge disappointment to me.... The fact that the story derails so much from the main theme of the game only to introduce a socio\/political agenda is a deal breaker for me and all the music or graphics in the world would not make this a better game. i cannot justify 60 bucks for a title as bad as this. I would not recommend this to any of my friends either. I like them too much.  1\/10 just for the people that worked their asses off to create this but had nothing to do with the story\/direction.\rNG do better next time. It's not that hard...\u2026 Expand","true":true}
