Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wtf.\\nThis is nonsense\\, this is just stupid\\, I have a hundred things to complain but I guess there is people who said it all\\, I just can add to say that this movie is bullshit for any fan and not fun.","true":true}
