Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I like Star Wars as much as the next guy but I'm not really a \\\"Super Fan\\\" or anything. I'm not sure how I feel about this movie though. I didn't hate it but on the other hand I didn't really like it either. The beautiful visuals and sometimes decent action scenes are broken by unneeded plots that drag out. Awkward \\\"disney\\\" attempts at humor. A weak attempt at \\\"social commentary\\\" (Rich people are bad mmm'kay). Characters I just couldn't bring myself don't care about. Unfinished and unexplained threads from TFA were just forgotten about. Some scenes that just make you shake your head and ask \\\"why did they shoot this?\\\"\\n\\nOverall It was sort of disappointing. Episode VII was no great feat but it did leave some interesting places for the story to go here in VIII that were ultimately disregarded in favor of a safe\\, boring\\, cliche good guy vs bad guy story with a lot of missed opportunities. #MarkWasRight\\n\\nI think I'll wait till Episode IX is on Amazon...","true":true}
