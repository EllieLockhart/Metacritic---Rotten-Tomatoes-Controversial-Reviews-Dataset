Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you hope to have your questions from episode 7 answered you will be extremely disappointed\\, the movie doesn't add nothing to the star wars lore\\, doesn't expand upon the new villains background stories on how they came to be\\, who they are and what are their motivations and most importantly\\, how most of the old characters from the original trilogy behave\\, you will feel extremely disconnected from them\\, just search for mark hamill's interviews around the internet even he doesn't agree with the direction luke skywalker was going. The action scenes and special effects are simply on point\\, if you are going to watch this movie to have a fun and good time with action packed space battels and nice lightsaber fights you will be quite entertained...","true":true}
