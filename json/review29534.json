Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson lack of awareness to the saga mythology\\, character motivation and grand story is painfully obvious\\, and The Last Jedi ends up being a total embarrassment that not only kills any sense of wonder and hype built in TFA\\, but also tarnishes the image of the iconic characters of the original trilogy.","true":true}
