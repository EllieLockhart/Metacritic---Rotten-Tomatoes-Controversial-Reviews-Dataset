Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let's throw out everything we learned about the force from the books and previous movies because this movie did just that. Good luck with9 you're going to need it since you jacked this movie up so bad. Loved Rogue one and watched it 5 times this movie is one and done.","true":true}
