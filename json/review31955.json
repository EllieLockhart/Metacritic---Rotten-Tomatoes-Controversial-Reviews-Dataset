Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(SPOILERS. AHEAD) i don't get the negative reviews at all. it's different from the other star wars films because it was bold. rey's parentage reveal was great because it shows that people.dont have to come from powerful. bloodlines to be capable of power as well. it's a strong message. and people keep wanting kylo ren to be the villain when i personally think of him as just a character. the dude is struggling because of the light in him. he is not your Big Bad no matter how he tries to be. my favorite storyline. to be honest. and luke? that was a great twist! the movie highlighted the fact that it's never black and white and even your favorite jedi can have moments of weakness. it's a bold move for sure but i for one am glad rian johnson was ballsy enough to do it. aside from these\\, the movie was really emotional and funny and. it's definitely one of my favorites!","true":true}
