Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mark Hamill is amazing as Luke Skywalker\\, and the story involving him\\, Kylo Ren\\, and Rey is the best part of the movie...but it's only PART of a 2.5 hour dumpster fire full of plot holes\\, merchandising\\, and moments so rediculous it makes Fonzie jumping a shark seem totally reasonable (Im talking about you Princess Leia). Besides the Jedi part of the story\\, you're basically watching a slow speed car chase (a la OJ Simpson) through outer space.","true":true}
