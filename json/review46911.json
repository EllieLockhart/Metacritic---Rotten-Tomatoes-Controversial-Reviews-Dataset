Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Went in with low expectations from all the negativity I'd been hearing\\, was very happy to see otherwise. Thought the movie\\, for the most part\\, was awesome! A huge improvement on Force Awakens. Starting to realize that Star Wars just has a very bitchy fanbase.","true":true}
