Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When ep 7 followed ep 4 very closely\\, people got angry. This film breaks the mold of what a star wars film can be about\\, and people are still angry. Let me set something straight: this film didn't make bad decisions (besides the negligible suspense of disbelief in every action film)\\, just some I didn't agree with. If I wrote the script sure I would have done some things differently\\, but it was very good. The action scenes were pretty great\\, and the quick paced plot kept me interested. My main complaints are just some of my star wars fantasies didn't make it in\\, not realistic criticisms. However\\, there were\\, in my opinion\\, a severe lack of light saber fights in the film (spoilers?). I love the dialogue and the developing story in the new trilogy\\, but I want more 1v1 red stick vs. blue stick action if that makes sense. And Kylo Ren is still a whiny little kid. Just had to mention. I'm definitely seeing the film a second time in a bigger theater; the people against at this film are understandable\\, but being illogical.","true":true}
