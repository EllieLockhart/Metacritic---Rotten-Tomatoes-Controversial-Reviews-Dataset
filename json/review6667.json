Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"DONT BELIEVE THE STAR WARS STANS. It was a great fucking movie. I like where the Star Wars franchise is headed. The writers have to break away to bring new storytelling to the forefront. For angry Stans: just because the story didn't go in the way you wanted doesn't make it a bad movie. It was exciting\\, well-acted\\, well-written\\, self-aware\\, and provided culturally relevant themes with layered nuances.","true":true}
