Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars is high fantasy. In high fantasy you create a world with its own rules\\, but once those rules are set\\, the same story telling 101 rules apply. For instance\\, a mcguffin or deus ex powers for the convenience of the plot are not good story telling unless established in the canon. Johnson is a good story teller\\, so i really don't know what happened here. \\n\\nA black stain on one of the greatest myths of our time.","true":true}
