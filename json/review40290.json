Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is one of my favourite Star Wars movies! The storytelling and action scenes are suburb. It's a cross between Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Visually\\, it's striking\\, particularly in the Empire room scene! The chemistry between the actors who play Rey and Kylo Ren is simmering. There are many classic Star Wars tongue in cheek moments to make you laugh out loud and action sequences to keep you on the edge of your seat. It's an upgrade from episode 7!","true":true}
