{"101487":144666,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was fine\\, but I saw some major problems in it:\\n\\nThe Finn\/Rose mission was a major\\, major part of the movie\\, which ultimately did nothing.  Also\\, there was a rather glaring plot-hole here\\, I thought.  When Finn\/Rose are captured about to turn off the tracker\\, it is revealed that Benicio Del Toro betrayed them and revealed that the rebels were escaping the large ship.  How could Benicio Del Toro's character have known that?  Poe didn't know that was the plan and he was the one in communication with Finn\/Rose.  So\\, that's one issue.\\n\\nSecond\\, I did not think the Luke story made a lot of sense.  So\\, he decided to \\\"let the jedi die\\\" because why\\, exactly?  He \\\"failed\\\" Ben by not preventing him from falling to the dark side?  Was that the idea?  So\\, to make up for this\\, he shuts himself off from everyone he cares about.  If he was on the island to protect something from falling into the dark side's hands\\, that would be great.  But\\, for him to just abdicate his role as a jedi master and let the sith take over is a really shitty way to complete Luke's character.  Also\\, we spent way too long on that island\\, and Luke didn't even end up training Rei!  It was a waste of time.  \\n\\nSnope is revealed in his glory\\, but we really don't get any backstory on him.  He was a very mysterious character in the first movie.  Now?  He's all over the place doing things\\, but we don't know anything about him.  How did he come to power?  How did he win over Ben Solo?  What were his force powers\\, exactly?  \\n\\nThere were a lot of bad things in the story telling of this movie.  I liked Mark Hamill's performance a lot.  I liked the reveal about Rei's parents a lot!  I think people have been giving the Leia saving herself scene a lot of grief\\, but I actually liked it.  It was nice to see her do something badass with the force for once.  \\n\\nAll in all\\, a very flawed\\, mediocre movie.","true":true}
