Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't get me wrong\\, the movie was full of amazing scenes\\, fulfilling moments\\, and was very enjoyable. But fans of TFA have been waiting for certain characters to shine\\, and questions to be answered. This movie did not please them. In fact it said to them\\, \\\"we don't care about any of that\\\".\\n\\nHonestly\\, I don't know what to look forward to in a 9th movie.","true":true}
