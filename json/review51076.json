Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely disgusting. Rian Johnson should hang his head in shame for destroying Star Wars. Everything from Leia's new force space regeneration\\, Hux now a laughing stock\\, Snoke being a nobody\\, Rey's parents being nobody\\, The whole canto bight catastrophe and to crown it off\\, the way Luke Skywalker\\, one of if not\\, thee most iconic Star Wars character of all time\\, is a grumpy old man who tried to kill his best friends son because he felt the dark side in him\\, the same person who convinced Darth Vader to turn good. ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. ( and don't get me started on rose) ","true":true}
