Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Brilliant - It had it\u2019s flaws but\\, this movie was never predictable in terms of the main plot and the story fits within the Star Wars world. The people that say otherwise must of watched a different movie. Make up your own mind and have fun discussing it with your other SW mates. I\u2019ll be defending it :) ","true":true}
