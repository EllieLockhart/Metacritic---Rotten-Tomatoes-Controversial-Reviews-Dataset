Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(Spoiler alert) I have to say that sometimes I wonder how a movie can draw this much critical acclaim and yet be this underwhelming.  It has been happening more and more recently.  I am a big fan of the old Star Wars movies\\, so perhaps it is more resentment that all of the original characters are being killed off with such a whimper.  The original dark side characters inspired resentment and dread while the heroes inspired hope and adrenaline.  That element seems missing here.  It's almost like the audience is being scolded and told that these are the characters you must like rather than drawing them in.  We are being told we must laugh at misplaced jokes.  There seems to be an attempt to make the new leading characters seem strong by making the old guard seem especially weak.  That lack of deference to the old guard won't work in my opinion.  Snoke was a character with some potential\\, some relevant storyline to him that ties him to the past.  And then he was immediately killed off.  A wasted opportunity.","true":true}
