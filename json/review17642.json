Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Is this the last movie of Star Wars sequel? I checked on google and it turns out that there is a Prequel Trilogy (I The Phantom Menace 1999\\, II Attack of The Clones 2000\\, III Revenge of The Sith)\\, an Original Trilogy (IV A New Hope 1977\\, V The Empire Strikes Back 1980\\, VI Return of The Jedi 1983) and a Sequel Trilogy (VII The Force Awakens 2015\\, VIII The Last Jedi\\, IX ?) So there will be another one since it's a trilogy..\\n\\nPersonally i'm enjoying it\\, there is a good amount of actions\\, humour and coolness! (:","true":true}
