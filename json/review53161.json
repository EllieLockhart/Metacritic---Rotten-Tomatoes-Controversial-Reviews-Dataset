Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"BAD Script. NOT up to Star Wars level. Great Acting and Directing. Many many loopholes and ridiculous plot points. Also too many Disney cutesy moments. The entire movie felt rushed - classic characters thrown a line or two.","true":true}
