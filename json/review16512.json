Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm very disappointed on what they did to this new series and the original characters as well. it has become a social engineering agenda in an era where being different with regards of opinion and beliefs are being outlawed and undermined. I can't relate to any of the new characters\\, maybe I don't have to\\, because my favorite characters story ark has concluded\\, the good thing about it is their invisible presence is felt. Perhaps the only character in the film I can relate to is Benicio Del Toro's character known as \\\"DJ\\\" the codebreaker\\, And yes\\, it's all a machinery both sides of the spectrum\\, good and evil. Even in your respective affiliations\\, there is no absolute good and evil in this world\\, it's how you make the most of it that makes it good and evil. \\\"Live free\\, don't join.\\\"  And yes\\, I don't need to join the collective of both sides\\, because of trend. And I only join based on what my mind and my heart tells me. and it tells me that the Star Wars saga should have ended in Return of the Jedi.","true":true}
