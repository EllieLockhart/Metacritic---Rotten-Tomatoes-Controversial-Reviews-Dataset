Not as good as TLOU1 in the emotive motif department but better in the gameplay defining sense)\rVisuals: A+ (Incredible that the \\\"graphics\\\" are achievable on dated hardware\\, but the real star is the variety of artistic assets\\, quality of animations\\, etc. Forgiven for re-using assets where hardware limitations apply.)\rEnvironments: A+ (As above\\, atmospheric visuals are world-beating. Semi-open world done well. Great for varied stealth approaches)\r\rDirecting: B+ (Druckmann isn't Ozu\\, but it's still industry-leading. Cameras\\, pacing\\, scenewriting are all good in my opinion. Not perfect\\, but good. Epilogue detracts from this\\, as do some abrupt transitions and overuse of flashbacks.)\r\rCharacters: B (ND took a huge risk in Abby. If you hate her then you'll probably hate a lot of this game. I personally think she is a great character. Other highlights: Dina\\, Owen\\, Joel. Weak points abound for Jesse\\, Manny\\, Tommy\\, Yara and Ellie. The last one being another thorn in people's sides. I understand why. Flawed but still industry-leading: Maria\\, Lev.  I care more about all of these characters than just about any character in any other video game.)\r\rStory: B (I split this in two: 1 = narrative cohesion and plot is quite poor overall. I don't take much issue with the cohesion of the main game's events - they're wrapped up into a tiny 3-day package so that makes sense - but the epilogue is a painful addition. 2 = Narrative power. The narrative makes for extremely compelling gameplay and moves things along like a nuke has gone off. Extremely effective narrative in this sense).\r\rGameplay: A+ (Game engine is robust and satisfying. Gunplay is awesome. AI is second to none. Difficulty is too forgiving at higher difficulties - you don't take that much damage. Large gap between survivor+ stealth sections\\, which are hard\\, and survivor+ gunfights\\, which are easy. Shows overreliance on super-vigilant AI to emulate difficulty\u2026 Expand","true":true}
