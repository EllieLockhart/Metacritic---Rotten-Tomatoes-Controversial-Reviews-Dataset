Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is was a mess. Bad story\\, bad character development\\, horrible dialogue.   The writing choices Betrayed the characters from the movies that preceded it\\, especially Luke \\, and retroactively made other Star Wars movies worse.  Don't waste your time on this stinker.","true":true}
