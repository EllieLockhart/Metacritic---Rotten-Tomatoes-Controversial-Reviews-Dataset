Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible!  Just horrible!  Leia flying through space??!!  Are you kidding me??!!  Disney\\, you have just lost a loyal fan forever.  I  couldn't stomach another one of these movies.  George's failures look positively glorious next to TLJ nightmare.  Never again.","true":true}
