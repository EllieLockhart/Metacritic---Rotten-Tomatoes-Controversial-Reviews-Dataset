Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible what they did to every remaining character. Seriously. So many cheap fake out moments it makes you wonder why even bother to film certain scenes as they end up being completely pointless. Leia is now space Mary Poppins. Characters are pointless\\, and incompetent. I've never seen such unthreatening villains with the exception of snoke who is completely wasted. A group of fans locked in a room with a 30 rack of keystone light over 48 hours on a weekend could have written a more coherent script. Don't support this garbage.","true":true}
