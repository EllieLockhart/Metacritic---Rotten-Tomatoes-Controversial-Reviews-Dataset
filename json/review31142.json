Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many Comic book guy from the Simpsons Reviews.  How do you not like the twists and turns of this.  For once it felt unexpected for a Star Wars follow up to any of the original 3.  It felt fresh and was action packed and fun.","true":true}
