Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I signed up for the express purpose of adding my review. I have never reviewed a movie\\, until now. In short\\, I'm stunned. I will never trust the \\\"professional\\\" critics Tomatometer again. 91%? That cannot have happened without either a direct monetary payoff or an epic groupthink meltdown a la The Emperor's New Clothes. The only real explanation I can think of is that critics have been scared or psychologically bullied into thinking that they have to like this franchise\\, regardless of how absolutely abominable the product is. I mean\\, with hundreds of millions of dollars at stake\\, a high profile reviewer who puts out a bad review could feel an awful lot of heat and could risk career suicide. I\\, on the other hand\\, have no such constraints. Previous reviewers have stated in many\\, many ways all the particulars about why this movie failed on so many levels. My ultimate conclusion is that this is the movie that gets made when you turn it over to the marketing department at Disney. You start a spreadsheet and list all the attributes\\, characters and plot points from the earlier films that audiences responded favorably to and that also have merchandising potential. You then build a script that stuffs as many of those elements as possible into it\\, regardless of whether it makes any sense. I watched this movie at home\\, without any bias from a Star Wars fan audience or any other pressures to like or dislike it. I hadn't read any reviews. It just happened to be available on Netflix. For the first thirty minutes\\, I was OK. Fast-paced\\, a few new characters\\, some good CGI. Then things started to unravel. Laborious backstory explanations\\, uninteresting action scenes\\, ridiculous sub plots\\, a seemingly unending parade of what were supposed to be dramatic reveals and confrontations. Midway through I was yelling at the screen. Near the end I was laughing out loud. At the end I just wanted it to stop. This movie was an epic failure to tell an epic story. What a waste of money\\, talent and time.","true":true}
