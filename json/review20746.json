Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to believe the critics and the hype about the movie but I have to wonder if they even watched the film. Given the fact it was an atrocity to Star Wars fans\\, it seems good and flashy for first time Star Wars viewers if only because so much did not make sense. I would have rather seen any of the prequels and had to listen to Jar Jar again than ever see this movie again. I hope critics learn to be critical of movies and consider the intended audience as opposed to \\\"great action scene\\\" or \\\"creative masterpiece\\\". It sure is a piece of something alright. I feel sorry for anyone that goes to see this movie. Worst Star Wars yet\\, no plans to see the next one.","true":true}
