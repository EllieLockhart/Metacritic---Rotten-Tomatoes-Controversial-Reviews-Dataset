Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worse movie of the franchise so far. Didn't feel like Star Wars in any way. Tried to be too smart for it own good\\, \\\"subverting\\\" expectations thinking it was introducing new ideas all while really only doing the same thing. It also felt vary dishonoring to Luke Skywalker. I'm all for character growth but many of us who last saw him in RTJ expected something more from the Jedi who was supposed to start it all back up. Made the OT seem pointless. ","true":true}
