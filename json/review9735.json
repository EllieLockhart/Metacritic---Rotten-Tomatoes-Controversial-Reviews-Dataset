Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good time at the movies. Although i have to admit it suffered some from what i call The Potter Effect - where all the Star Wars movies are starting to blend together and it feels the same\\, like the Harry Potter movies. Bad guy vs good guy\\, running from bad guy\\, crazy mad man\\, princess escaping\\, funny weird creature\\, etc. I love Adam Driver\\, but i find his portrayal really annoying like a naughty boy acting out. I think Carrie Fisher was best thing in the movie. I will continue to see these\\, but i liked Rogue One better. Looking forward to Han Solo movie.","true":true}
