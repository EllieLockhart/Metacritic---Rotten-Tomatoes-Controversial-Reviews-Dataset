Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is so much to love about The Last Jedi. I was very entertained watching this 8th Star Wars saga film\\, I'll see it again\\, there's some truly beautiful scenes\\, all that jazz. But I am not fully on board with The Last Jedi. The film is a fun watch\\, and if you were to take it as a whole\\, then place it in a bubble\\, it's a pretty good movie too\\, but a lot about it is... Pointless. I'm not saying the movie was pointless\\, it has a lot to offer\\, and deserves its place as Episode VIII\\, but there are moments started within The Last Jedi that end up being pointless by the time the credits roll\\, and more than that\\, it goes back to ideas from the Star Wars saga as a whole\\, and makes them pointless too.","true":true}
