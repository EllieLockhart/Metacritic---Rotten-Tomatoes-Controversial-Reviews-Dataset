Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a popular saying that no one hates on Star Wars as much as a Star Wars fanatic\\, and I see that as partially true. But as Star Wars fan\\, I can personally say that I loved this film. It may not be up to the lofty standards of the original trilogy\\, but in my opinion\\, it's the best Star Wars flick since \\\"Return of the Jedi\\\". I look at the audience score creeping lower and lower and find myself dumbfounded. Why the hate? I understand some of the issues with Rose Tico\\, but she's nowhere near the level of horrible that Jar Jar Binks is. She wasn't as much of a profound character\\, but she wasn't pure rubbish. I understand some disagreement with the Canto Bight sequence\\, and is it the worst sequence is the film? Yes. But the worst in all of Star Wars? No. There's so much to love about this film. The cameo from Yoda? Amazing! Still the wise old Jedi he was in the Original Trilogy. Luke projecting himself on Crait? Awesome. The opening battle sequence. Awesome\\, again demonstrating Poe's talent. Overall\\, I think this film is getting way more than it deserves. I love Star Wars!","true":true}
