Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing film! Bad writing\\, lots of plot holes and more poor jokes than good ones. Even more unbelievable moments than one should expect in a sci-fi fantasy (e. g. Mary Poppins Leia and bombs dropped 'down' in zero gravity space). Did going to the casino even matter? Why was Holdo such a dick to Poe? Also\\, who's Snoke? Who's Rey? Why is she so good at the Force without special parentage or training? So much wrong about this movie. It is sad.","true":true}
