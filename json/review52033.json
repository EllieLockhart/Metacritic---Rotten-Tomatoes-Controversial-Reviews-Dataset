Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After having to swallow with disgust the news of disney buying Star Wars\\, the complete annihilation of the expanded universe\\, which involved almost my entire life span of stories in video games\\, comics and books. I decided to give a chance to the new movies. Not only was I dissapointed by some massive loop holes\\, chronological and timing mess as well as mainstream characters in the force awakens but they kept some of the life\/essence of the main characters such as Han and chewie. I was intrigued of learning the story of luke isolation (and what happened to Leia)\\, just as yoda and kenobi before him\\, I expected meaning not just complete destruction of the character built in the previous movies just giving up.\\nI hate to say it and it saddens me to know that perhaps one of the best stories in cinema with so many rich characters have fallen so far from its origins. I have come to realize that the star wars i loved ended when its creator and visionary stop steering its future\\, now i understand some of the claims of mark hamill being in total disagreement and why harrison ford jumped ship.","true":true}
