The layers of suffering upon suffering that feel being shoved very early on to the point I got desinsitized. The long stretches of uneventful gameplay. What's not wrong about it?\r\rIn a world where subjectivism is acceptable\\, perfect scores on the extremes are not in this context. Even if one attempts to overlook how the plot is build up\\, gameplay wise there are long stretches of this game that feel untouched compared to the first title. The puzzles are too simplistic and serve no purpose other than to slow you down.\r\rI tried at least to hold on to gameplay and even in that I was disappointed. For me it gets a 3 based on some sparse thrilling events with great animations and environment but everything else is unfortunately poorly executed. In a game that was designed around linear narrative\\, it was hard for me not to look at this as a mediocre experience.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
