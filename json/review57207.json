Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This might be the most divisive Star Wars movie\\, not universally loved like the original trilogy or universally loathed like the prequels. Huge discrepancy between the positive critics reviews and lukewarm audience reviews\\, which is unusual for a Hollywood blockbuster. I suspect the audience didn't care for some of the narrative choices and the porgs\\, which reminded them being condescended to with the Ewoks and the prequels. The critics probably had their arms twisted by Disney into giving positive reviews--none of them can afford professionally to not be invited to a screening of Episode IX.\\n\\nI liked the movie better than most fans I know. The porgs had a small enough role to not be too much a distraction. (Am I alone in assuming Chewie brought them along to eat them later?) Most fans said it was too long. At 2:32\\, it is a bit longer than the prequels\\, and much longer than the original films. What made it feel \\\"too long\\\" was the structure--this is a four-act film in a series that has thus far only included three acts. I didn't mind this structure\\, and felt like Rian Johnson gave the audience it's money's worth.\\n\\nThe problems I had with this film was mainly the tone. While not as tonally jarring as the prequels\\, it tried to be too funny\\, and almost all the jokes fell flat. So many emotional moments were undercut with a badly executed quip. The movie starts with Poe Dameron prank calling the First Order and making a \\\"yo mama\\\" joke (seriously--very cringe-worthy). Luckily the movie gets past that. Some times I couldn't tell they were making a joke. It was mainly in the comedic timing that I realized what they were going for. I don't remember the Empire Strikes Back filled with wisecracks.\\n\\nAs for the story\\, I liked it overall\\, and enjoyed the direction they took the characters. The narrative flaws were mainly in the second act\\, with Finn and Rose going on an ultimately pointless side mission. This movie contained too many characters and subplots\\, which contributed to the feeling this movie was too long.\\n\\nAlso\\, without getting into spoilers\\, for a middle installment of a trilogy\\, this movie left us with no big question marks to pique our interest in the final installment. It is clear Disney doesn't know where they are taking the series\\, and I don't know how much longer I can sustain my interest in these films. I'll always love the original trilogy\\, which was somehow better before they started making more movies.","true":true}
