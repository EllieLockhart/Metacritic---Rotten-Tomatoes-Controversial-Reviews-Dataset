Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is a step in the direction Star Wars needed to take in 1999. The film takes daring turns and explores the force in places it has never been. Do not listen to this blasphemous score. If people cannot kill the past then they cannot accept this glorious franchise. Don\u2019t let nostalgia get in the way of a great film.","true":true}
