Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rey becomes even more boring and the ultimate Mary Sue in this movie. Kylo Ren is as whiny and boring as ever. Finn goes from being somewhat useless to completely useless...and boring. Poe was meh. Rian Johnson took the only redeemable aspects from TFA and tossed them aside for lazy writing and characterizations that were completely off - See his take on Luke.","true":true}
