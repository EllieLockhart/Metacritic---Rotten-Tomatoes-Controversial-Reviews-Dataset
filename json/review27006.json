Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best Star Wars movies. It's thrilling from the beginning to the end. And the director takes some bold moves that really pays of. There are only two weak scenes in rhe middle of the movie\\, where one is outright poorly conceived and executed. But that scene alone does not change the overall complete achievement of this movie. Amazing performances by Mark Hamilton\\, Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver.","true":true}
