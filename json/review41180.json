Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has no protagonist\\, is riddled with plot holes\\, can't possibly be a sequel to the previous instalment\\, makes the already terrible Star Wars franchise that much worse.\\n\\nI didn't think it possible\\, but it manages to be the very worst film in the whole franchise. Not an easy feat.","true":true}
