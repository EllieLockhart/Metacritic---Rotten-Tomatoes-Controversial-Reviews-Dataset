Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Depending on what you're expectations for this film were it can be described as either a beautifully shot and wonderfully philosophical picture or the beginning of the end of the franchise. Some have strongly criticized Luke's treatment within the film however I believe that luke still represents hope although the hope he represents is of a different nature. The hope that Luke represents is finding peace and purpose within yourself after facing debilitating remorse and depression related to failure. I feel that people's expectations interfered with their enjoyment of the film. Watch or rewatch without expectations to get the most out of this film.","true":true}
