Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Im not quite sure why people are hating on this film. I.T was a great entertaining film. There wasn't really much I didn't like about It. Granted every film has its problems. But I thought this was WAY better than episode 7.","true":true}
