Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi is a kind of movie i've never seen in years.  It has everything a good film needs to be.  The movie also bring wobderful eye-dazzling special effects. And most of all\\,  it brings us deep into the spiritualism and mysticism of The Force\\,  which i found lacks in The Force Awakens and the prequels. But i'm a little disappointed of the absence of a great lightsaber battle","true":true}
