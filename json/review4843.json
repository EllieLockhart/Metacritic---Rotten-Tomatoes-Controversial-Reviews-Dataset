Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Conclusion;\\nI feel cheated by Disney and am annoyed I paid for a ticket to see a cinematic icon in Luke Skywalker milk a space sea cow and not fight with a lightsaber.  I went four times to see the force awakens as I was hyped up about star wars.  The Last Jedi has ruined the franchise for me and I will not be giving Disney another penny unless they somehow remake episode 8.","true":true}
