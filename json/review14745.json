Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have not heard anyone say a nice word about this film\\, and you will never hear me say a kind word for it. Half a star is among my most magnanimous gestures. Not by choice\\, if I could give this movie a lower rating I would.","true":true}
