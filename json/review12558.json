Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\ufe0f can\u2019t believe they decided to go another direction. They absolutely ruined Star Wars. I\u2019m so hurt and disappointed. I\ufe0f honest wish they had never done this trilogy. How could you Rian.","true":true}
