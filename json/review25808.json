Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not being the biggest Star Wars fan\\, I didn't really know what to expect. Admittedly\\, I was anticipating a more thrilling movie than what I saw but overall\\, I enjoyed it. This one had a much different feel than other  movies and was darker in tone. There definitely is still humor there but it went for a more gripping storyline. There were some questionable choices\\, including an ill-advised romance subplot and questionable decisions as far as character development but it was solid overall.","true":true}
