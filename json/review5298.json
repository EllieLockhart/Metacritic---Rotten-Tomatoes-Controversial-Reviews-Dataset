Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Definitely not anything near teh Empire Strikes back.  What a farce. The movie fell flat from the beginning.   The first seen with Luke was hideous.  Luke is not true to himself\\, and apparently learned nothing from Obi Wan and Yoda or from his life experiences.  Leia apparently is truly magical.  The questions left at the end of the Force Awakens are either ignored or answered poorly.  Most of the humor was ill timed and was rarely funny.  I didn't hear many laughs.  Instead of being excited and full of energy at the end of the movie\\, the audience quietly filed out\\, apparently perplexed at what they had just seen.  I am truly sorry I wasted $50.00 to take the family to see this one. I don't think I will see another Star wars movie.  If Rian Johnson has anything to do with a movie\\, I guarantee that I won't.","true":true}
