Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left the theater confused\\, trying to search my feelings about the movie I just watched. Now\\, four months later\\, I can say I feel disappointed. Lack of plot continuity from TFA\\, Luke becomes a loser not capable of defeating a force apprentice. The first order are a bunch of morons whom you can prank anytime via speaker. The supreme leader is another loser who can't feel the force and we are presented with super boring non interesting characters like Rose and Holdo. I did liked TFA. Way to ruin ruin the franchise Disney. not spending a single penny ever on anything Star Wars related.","true":true}
