Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wonderful film. ITs both dark and cheerfully. Very adult for a Star Wars film. Much care was taken in showing the good and bad in everyone. No one I said just one thing. But some choose to be.","true":true}
