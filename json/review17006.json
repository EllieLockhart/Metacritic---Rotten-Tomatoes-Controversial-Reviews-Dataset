Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really don't know why I'm giving this film such a high \\\"score\\\". This film insulted a viewers intelligence as to what a film should deliver. I'm a huge star Wars fan and I wanted to love this movie after the huge disappointment in The Force Awakens. The Last Jedi made me cringe and face palm throughout the entire film. I've never walked away from ANY film feeling the way I did with this movie. How anyone can give this monstrosity over 2 stars is beyond me.","true":true}
