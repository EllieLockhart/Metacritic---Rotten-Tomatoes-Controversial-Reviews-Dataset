Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am honestly surprised this movie got made. Ruined the lore of the other seven movies. I am in the camp that they should throw this away and try again. So many awesome topics brought up in ep vii that were irresponsibly handled and squashed in this movie that there is nothing to currently look forward to in ep ix. I would honestly watch TPM before I watched this. I truly question anyone who says this is a good movie. RIan Johnson screwed this franchise and should be ashamed.","true":true}
