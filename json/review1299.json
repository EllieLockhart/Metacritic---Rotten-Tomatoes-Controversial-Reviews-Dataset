Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A really great movie if you look at it as a stand alone film\\, a film you can actually re-watch it on its own. Yes the movie f**ks with the stars wars story but hey\\, enjoyed every minute of it so who the hell cares.","true":true}
