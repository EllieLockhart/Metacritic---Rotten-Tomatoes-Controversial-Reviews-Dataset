Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was seriously too much. There are basically no breaks whatsoever\\, the characters never get adequately fleshed out\\, the constant jokes ruin almost every serious moment\\, and the plot was literally useless\\, telling us what we already knew: Kylo Ren is a terrible ***hole.\\nNot to mention instead of actually fleshing out the character's\\, Rian Johnson completely butchers them. The treatment both Finn and Poe get are incredibly racist and go against who they are entirely\\, and Rose is there... to just be there. Her character is basically pointless and that is so\\, so disappointing and upsetting. She deserved more. And now Luke Skywalker... Rian did an extreme disservice to our beloved hero. Not only is he incredibly out of character\\, but what they did to him in reference to the end of the movie shouldn't have been done in a Star Wars film as terrible as this.\\nPlus there are so many plot holes it's absolutely ridiculous... The whole movie basically just goes against everything Star Wars stands for.\\nI can understand Rian Johnson and the crew's push for change in Star Wars\\, and I agree that there does need to be a change for the end of the saga\\, but this movie brought NOTHING good or new (in a useful sense) to the table. It went too far and now it's just a horrible mess\\, and fails as the second addition to a trilogy.\\nThere's so much more I could say\\, but I don't want this to get too long.","true":true}
