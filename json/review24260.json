Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Me la vi en 4DX\\, la experiencia me distrajo de la narrativa un poco por sus efectos especiales y las escenas de los aviones\\, pero no fue suficiente para ver que la narrativa de la pel\u00edcula es p\u00e9sima\\, una tristeza\\, no tiene sentido ni coherencia\\, una direcci\u00f3n muy mala. Pensaba que la s\u00e9ptima era lo peor\\, pero ahora despu\u00e9s de ver esta\\, me encanta la s\u00e9ptima.","true":false}
