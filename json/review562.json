The best part of this game for me was the option given at every moment in the story. We're given a very basic \\\"cabin in the woods\\\" horror setting with average horror character tropes that YOU get to either adhere to or ignore. For me\\, I chose to adhere to them which made the game not only thrilling\\, but fun as hell. Oh\\, this is the irreverent sexy blonde? Let's kill her off. Oh\\, you're the smart\\, sincere\\, pure girl? You have to live to the finale. It was an absolute blast and unlike any other games I've played\\, this game requires attention to detail and playing through the story again. It's an 8 hour movie with YOU and the controls. You get to write the story as you go. There's no losing\\, there's only following through with whatever choices you make because you can't go back. It doesn't take much skill\\, it only takes a lot of deliberation and confidence. Other than pushing some buttons\\, the game does the rest and you're along for the ride. The only thing I didn't like was that this game didn't really become the haunted house game that it sort of implied it would. \\\"What if I told you this house was haunted?\\\" is something that you're asked towards the beginning\\, yet nothing is haunted which let me down. If there's one thing that scares me\\, it's what I can't see because it could be anything\\, but this game eventually shows you what is going on and I didn't find it as scary as I anticipated.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
