Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So badly written. It was so painful to watch. Forced love story. Obnoxious characters. Stories that don't quite mesh well are haphazardly glued together rather than woven. Rogue One was light years better than this. What happened?","true":true}
