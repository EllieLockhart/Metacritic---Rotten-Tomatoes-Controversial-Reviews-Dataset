Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney just lost a passionate Star Wars fan who has always been eager to read the latest comic books\/novels or watch the movies and TV shows. That's why I've always seen Star Wars as an ongoing story but it seems the director of The Last Jedi does not\\, it felt more like a standalone movie lacking of context and continuity. The movie was a slap in the face for many fans because it takes all the former installments of the Star Wars franchise and throws them into a trash compactor... the Jedi\\, the force all of it. Instead of pleasing the fans with an exciting and epic plot Disney aims for silly jokes and a message to all their fans \\\"Let go of the past\\, we are making stories for a new generation of fans now\\, we don't need you anymore\\\". I mean if that's what you want Disney here take all your stuff back I don't even want to be a Star Wars fan anymore.","true":true}
