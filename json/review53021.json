Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a movie\\, it's fine. Entertaining at times\\, nice visuals\\, wonderful performances.\\n\\nAs a Star Wars film? A real disappointment. Rian Johnson had so much to work with--wonderful cast and character set-ups. Instead he chose to insist we feel pity and attraction to a patricidal  serial killer. He made a fool of every character\\, even if they had been well-rounded\\, in-depth characters. He sends two characters on a fetch quest that not only fails\\, but causes more issues. He spins his wheels. He attempts to make some edgy movie point about how suffering and disappointment is the true hero's journey\\, but only succeeds in making this imperative character seem flighty and melodramatic. He takes the most skilled pilot\\, fighters\\, leaders and makes them wildly incompentent. In fact\\, the droids are the only good resistance fighters in Johnson's interpretation.  Johnson took everything good from The Force Awakens and mangled it in The Last Jedi.\\n\\nTwo years of waiting and hoping\\, and we were really let down. The only good part of this movie is the delightful and skilled performances\\, but performances for a weak plot. The actors and characters deserved better than this.","true":true}
