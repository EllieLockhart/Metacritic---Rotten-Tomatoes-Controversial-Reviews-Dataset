Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I seriously do not understand all the hate on this. I thought it was brilliant. The twists and turns was what I loved about it. In fact\\, I felt like all the cornball crap from force awakens got booted. I was glad! I can't think of one thing I disliked about it.","true":true}
