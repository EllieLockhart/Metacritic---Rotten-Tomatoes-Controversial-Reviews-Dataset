Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The subplot with Rose and Finn was a tough to watch but better on a second viewing. Not a perfect film but thena great entry to the franchise. I love how they developed the characters of Kylo\\, Rey\\, and Luke in the movie. The best lightsaber battle of the new franchise is in this mov. Some great visuals all around with great ca decent story to back it up. Again Finn and Rose are not my favorite but the rest stood out.","true":true}
