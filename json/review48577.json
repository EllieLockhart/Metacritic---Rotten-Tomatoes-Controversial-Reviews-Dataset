Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"worse star wars movie ever\\, including prequels. Characters brought in\\, hyped up only to die. Character arcs that make no sense. Scenes that leave you with a sense of what the heck did I just watch? It was a confusing takes too long jumbled mess of a movie and that's not even starting in on what they did with our two most beloved characters. See it once that's all you'll ever want to.","true":true}
