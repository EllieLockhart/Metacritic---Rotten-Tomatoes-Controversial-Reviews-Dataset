{"101487":140660,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think people \\\"fans\\\" are being way too hard on this film. They simply aren't keeping an open mind. Quoting Kylo\\, \\\"Let the past die.\\\" This film let's the past die in a meaningful\\, symbolic way. There are ZERO wasted opportunities\\, you just have to think of the choices they made on a deeper level. For example\\, SPOILERS FOR LAST JEDI---- Rey's parentage. The buildup to Rey's true parents was one that was theorized\\, and people hate the true revelation\\, that Rey is in fact no one. But I love this for the same reason I love the very end of the film\\, with the little boy. Who is ANYONE to say HOW the force works\\, or what it's all about. The original films never said that the Force was bloodlines\\, or family\\, but like Anakin it arises in the most unlikely of places. Rey may not be the new Jon Snow\\, the prophetic chosen one\\, but she is strong with the force\\, and she is a better character than in the Force Awakens because of it. Luke Skywalker's portrayal is incredible\\, conflicted\\, like Kylo Ren. His death was meaningful to starting the new wave\\, the new journey\\, and \\\"letting the past die.\\\" They did it beautifully\\, in my opinion\\, having him go out the same way as Yoda\\, and with the same purpose\\, of leaving the new Jedi to save the galaxy. If people think his show down with Kylo or Snoak was a wasted opportunity\\, please go back and watch again\\, because Luke's character was not only badass\\, but one of the best parts. Finally\\, the third main complaint: Snoak. Snoak\\, although some people may think of him as a wasted opportunity\\, I personally believed that the twist of Kylo killing him was worth it. Snoak is a parallel to Luke\\, and although I wish I had heard more about his powers and why he is so strong\\, it still fits into the idea that the force is awakening\\, and keeping the tradition of Sith apprentices rising above their masters\\, bringing the true villain to the equation\\, Kylo Ren. There were no predictable twists of bad guy turns good. Kylo didn't turn good he simply wanted to be the ruler of his own destiny\\, but Rey wants what's best for the Galaxy. There is no in between\\, The Last Jedi is\\, what Star Wars has always been\\, Good versus Evil\\, Light versus Darkness\\, Jedi vs. Sith. That's why Episode VIII was incredible.","true":true}
