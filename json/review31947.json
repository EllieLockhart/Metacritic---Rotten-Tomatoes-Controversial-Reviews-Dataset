Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoiler:\\n\\nSo u wait 2 years to get the mystery lifted who snoke is.. who are reys parents.. what reaction will luke have after rey hands him his saber after his father cut it off...  all for trash...\\nThe entire franchise could have been connected\\, instead\\, Disney made the obvious play to usher out the old. All the beloved characters felt\\, cheap.","true":true}
