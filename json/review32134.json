Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(Spoilers warning) This movie was sincerely disappointing. The central plot\\, if you take away the somewhat pointless side plots\\, was one large ship slowly chasing another. The little bird creatures and milking of the green juice were of the same cloth as the cheesy throw-away laughs so reviled from the prequels. Leia's space walk was so poorly written and executed it gave second-hand embarrassment just to watch. The vast Star Wars universe was made to feel incredibly small with the ever-shrinking number of warriors and ships. If you look at the film as a stand-alone piece it is vastly negative with ceaseless bickering and failures throughout. There is little resolution and the ending leaves those who feel connected to the Star Wars saga wondering if even the best writers could fix the damage done to these iconic characters. As a life-long Star Wars fan I can only say that I feel disheartened and disappointed that Disney would pump out such a disastrous piece just to make money on this brand. I cannot see myself being persuaded to see the next film in theaters.","true":true}
