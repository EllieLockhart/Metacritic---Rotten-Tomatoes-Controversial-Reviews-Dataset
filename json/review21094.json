Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was so excited and so let down by the movie. They seemed to have forgotten what made the movies great which is the characters and the story. What a let down and I'm bummed I spent so much to watch a repeat of the Phantom Menace again!!!!! How do you make Rogue One which had great characters and a tight story to Luke milking a jelly creature??\\nCinematic Swill!!!!!","true":true}
