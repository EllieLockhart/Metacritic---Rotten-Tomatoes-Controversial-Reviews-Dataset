Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(posting a second time with indented paragraphs)\\n\\nFirstly\\, I feel sorry for Rotten Tomatoes that they are so fearful of Disney that they have to falsify the percentages. I come back to the page day after day and that 48% refuses to budge\\, while the negatives outweigh the positives at least 5 to 1 (and about half of the positive reviews look fake to me).\\n\\nThanks to all the reviewers who have posted their thoughts. Whether they were insightful\\, amusing or crass\\, they were all from the heart\\, and I find myself coming here day after day to read the long ones. It gives me solace that I am not alone\\, and I wish there was a like feature.\\n\\nAs bewildered as I was when I walked out of the cinema (twice)\\, it took me a long time to fathom the 'why'. Why trash the most famous movie series of all time? Why burn bridges\\, why ignore all the set ups from the previous movie\\, why\\, why\\, why disgrace the Luke Skywalker character and alienate all the fans? Anyway\\, I've finally got it.\\n\\nThe only way this movie makes any sense is if Disney tried to make a Star Wars movie for 8-year old girls. Frozen in a galaxy far far away. Frozen is the archetype as it is the only way it can make sense as a story pitch and also have gotten the green light from the studio.\\n\\nI think Disney was so surprised by the success of Frozen\\, and so sucked in by the Feminist publicity that they forgot that Frozen was a damn kids movie not a manifesto.  Nevertheless they had the conceit to double down and remake Star Wars with all the (apparently?) contentious politically incorrect parts ripped out to simply to humiliate those dinosaur white middle aged fans.\\n\\nSo let's view this as Frozen in space. Everything naturally has to be dumbed right down (no harm in that if you are catering to a 8-year old I suppose). So the 'goodies' side is led by the heroine character (Rey) who has a mysterious past and can do anything (because Disney heroes are always 'special' and always have mysterious pasts). There are wise and kindly grandmother types (Leia\\, Purple-haired Headmistress)\\, strong but wise female offsiders (Rose and her sister)\\, and of course cute animals with big eyes. Naturally - if Frozen is anything to go by - the male characters have to be 'baddies' because... girlpower?\\n\\nAnyway\\, every man is portrayed as foolish or reckless\\, and stupid to boot. In short\\, not to be trusted. Luke becomes the cantankerous old man only there as an obstacle to the heroine\\, and Snoke is just the 'boss baddie' to be defeated and level up. No backstory needed! Catering to the pre-teen segment for a minute (Twilight)\\, Kylo Ren is cast as the brooding 'bad boy' with a cute looks but dark past who is set up to inevitably (in episode 9) become the love interest and happily ever after. Way to go Disney!\\n\\nThis is the only way this movie makes any kind of sense. Which is why the movie is insulting to both the female and male audience.\\n\\nIf you want strong female characters look at Ripley or Vasquez from Aliens. Hermione and Ginny from Harry Potter. Take your pick! Women to be sure\\, and proud of it. But strong because of who they are\\, not what they are. I doubt even the most strident of Feminists would have been satisfied with the portrayal of women in this film.\\n\\nAnyway\\, enough of the backstory. Whatever the reason it got green lighted\\, it's a stinker. Rotten\\, to use this site's own words. It's a stinker not just as a movie (without the name Star Wars it would have bombed)\\, but as a Star Wars movie it is a travesty and an insult. Rian Johnson ought to be ashamed of himself\\, and if he can't see what we are all complaining about then he's a conceited fool as well as an incompetent writer.\\n\\nA few comments:\\n\\nThe gravity bombs thing was stupid\\, but we don't get so upset about gravity inside space ships\\, and especially not the fact that sound doesn't travel in a vacuum. If they could have just made them bombs 'fall' like from the Tie Bomber in ESB we wouldn't be too upset.\\n\\nSpace ships running out of fuel was a contrived plot device and makes out the rebels to be completely incompetent as a fighting force. What kind of resistance force doesn't bring spare fuel\\, and who schedules all the fuel tanks to run out at exactly the same time? Mind you\\, the New Order aren't much better\\, they don't have any ships that go very fast\\, and they don't have the common sense to hyperspace ahead of the rebels. Oh and their turbo lasers don't work anymore.\\n\\nThere are so many things Luke could have done when presented with the lightsaber. Hold it in awe\\, drop to his knees and weep\\, throw it off the cliff in anger\\, or held it to Rey's neck. The shoulder toss? Not in a million years.\\n\\nI truly feel for Mark Hamill. He became as famous as one of the Beatles because of that role\\, and in his triumphant return to acting he has to play the part of ...a jaded hobo? What a pro to go through with it\\, but what a damn shame. \\n\\nWhich begs the question of WTF did they film that \\\"my family had it\\, and now you have it\\\" part in the TFA trailers and then not use it? Did Disney really not have at least the bare bones of a story written for all three movies? Who runs a studio like that?\\n\\nI didn't actually hate the Rose character. I think she'll end up being a fan favourite because there's a whole demographic out there with chubby Asian fetish (or maybe it's just me). It's just a pity that she wasn't given anything interesting to do\\, and her only purpose was to give an emotional angle due to dead sister and incredibly convenient slave girl backstory. Oh and some moralizing \\\"make love not war\\\" comment which is pretty weird coming from a freedom fighter or should I say member of banned terrorist group.\\n\\nWhat about the salt planet battle grand finale? Is that the best idea anyone could come up with? Why not Imperial Walkers climbing their way up a desolate mountain valley\\, or Imperial Walkers emerging out of the water\\, or Imperial Walkers coming over the rim of a crater on the moon? That would have made for an iconic and original setting. A salt planet that looks embarrassingly like Hoth? Originality be damned\\, three cheers for you Disney.\\n\\nBB8 was fun in TFA. Like a modern R2D2 and I liked that. But in this movie he (it?) turned into the equivalent of the Doctor's Sonic Screwdriver or Harry Potter's wand. A convenient plot device.\\n\\nLastly\\, the humour (enough people have commented about Leia\\, Emo Vader\\, Rey and Yoda). It's not true that \\\"Star Wars has always had humour\\\". What Star Wars had was iconic lines that entered the lexicon. And by that I mean \\\"Scruffy looking Nerf Herder\\\"\\, \\\"Laugh it up fuzzball\\\" or \\\"You rebel Scum\\\". \\n\\nThose lines were not actually funny\\, what they are is iconic\\, and they fit the tone of the scene perfectly. That's why the prank call was stupid\\, the Fin squirting water thing was stupid\\, the chrome dome remark was stupid\\, and the slot machine gun was stupid. Way to go Disney. What a bunch of willful incompetents.\\n\\nMaybe they will invoke time travel in the next movie and find a way to write poor Carrie out of the script at the same time. As far as I am concerned this movie is non-canonical and I wish it had never been made.","true":true}
