Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a standalone film not set in a galaxy far far away\\, The Last Jedi  would work.  Sadly\\, however\\, it looks like Star Wars\\, but doesn't FEEL like Star Wars.  \\n\\nVisually it is stunning.  John Williams' score is also once again sublime.  The performance of Mark Hammill is also commendable\\, though the way Rian Johnson uses the character of Luke Skywalker in the wider story arc is questionable and somewhat disappointing.  \\nWhere The Last Jedi falls down most is in cementing its place as a continuation of Episodes 1 through to 7.  The new characters introduced in The Force Awakens have had very little development - indeed\\, the motivations and purpose of the majority of them is incredibly lacking\\, and many of the questions posed about these new characters at the end of The Force Awakens have been brushed aside without any fitting conclusion.  \\nThe final scene is so far removed from a Star Wars film it is unimaginable.  There was nothing about the conclusion of this film that left me wanting to find out what happens next - nothing is set up for Episode IX or beyond.\\nThere were lots of comments around this being a fitting finale and tribute to Carrie Fisher.  While her performance as General Leia in this instalment was credible\\, as with Luke\\, Johnson failed to use the character in a way that truly adds any depth or purpose to the story.  Indeed\\, a fantastic opportunity to sacrifice Leia was passed up early in the film\\, and we were offered one of the worst scenes in Star Wars history in its place.\\nI am left scratching my head to what Episode VIII is attempting to add to the saga.  The theme of the movie that is repeated throughout is one of letting the past go - letting the Jedi\\, the Sith\\, and all that we have learned about the force across the saga fade into insignificance and to expect a shift away from all of that.  Disney clearly want to make their own movies in the galaxy far far away and cannot wait to ditch the Skywalker saga that is holding them back.  It actually makes me question what the point in making this trilogy actually is.  If it's not going to serve to offer an alternative\\, fitting end to the stunning redemption of Vader in Episode VI\\, then what is the point?  Disney could have just acquired the franchise and worked on spin off standalone movies like the excellent Rogue One and done their own thing in other spin offs \/ original stories.  \\nThis is the first time I've left at the end of a Star Wars movie and not instantly wanted to book to go and see it again.  \\n\\nTo say I'm disappointed is an understatement.  In saying as much\\, however\\, I feel I do need to acknowledge that some of the scenes were stunning - the big moments were fantastic in their own right\\, they just lacked the emotional gravity that similar moments across the saga have had.","true":true}
