Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Being a devoted Star Wars fan since I was a young boy\\, The Last Jedi was a complete let down. So many odd scenes and things that don\u2019t fit. Luke\\, the master Jedi is now a whiny old man with no balls on an island? The one person who could of given this movie definition at the end but failed to do so on so many levels. Leia\\, uses the force to float back to the ship? Never in a million years did I ever think I would see that. It doesn\u2019t fit at all. Then after she gets back it\u2019s straight to a hospital bed? Laughable. Who ever thought up this ship chase needs to have their head examined. Are you telling me with all their power they couldn\u2019t call for more ships to cut them off? This movie could of been taken so many places\\, yet the director failed to do so. Keep in mind I bought these tickets 2+ months ago because Star Wars is normally the best that hits the screen.","true":true}
