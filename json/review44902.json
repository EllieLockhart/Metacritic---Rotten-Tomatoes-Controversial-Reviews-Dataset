Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Two stars because I love star wars but this movie was a huge disappointment.  The story didn't make sense.  It was directionless garbage that left a lot of setup plot lines from episode 7 with the least interesting conclusions. Please remake the movie!","true":true}
