Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't say much other than what's all ready been said about this garbage pile...\\n\\nBut it goes like this - JJ Abrams sets up Rian Jonshon for a sweet slam dunk with the ultimate alley-oop called The Force Awakens... Anticipation is high - Johnson is in the air! He has the ball! He then lands on the ground\\, chucks the ball into the nose bleed seats\\, places his palms at his mouth and makes a fart noise\\, then gives double middle fingers to everything Star Wars ever was or could be. Absolute disaster... \\n\\nNo stars. This makes Phantom Menace look like an absolute masterpiece.","true":true}
