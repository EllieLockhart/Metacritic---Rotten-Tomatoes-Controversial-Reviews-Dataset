Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"One of the worst storiesBuilding a story on the killing of a loved character (the character that the entire first part is built on) and then forcing players to go to certain locations everytime you get to a location then you have to go to another (turned into a traveling game just go and find that person i understand it's not that horrible but when you do it throughout the entire game it becomes really bad) the characters are pointless\\, isaac only appeard twice while his name was mentioned even more than joel and then simply dies. anyway after a while it gets really boring and then comes the worst twist in video games i have ever seen forcing players to play the villian and forcing them to understand why that happend. That was the worst thing you can think of\\, every character has a backgroud whether we know it or not and yes life sometimes is unfair as what it did to joel in the first part and no life is not always bad you have your moments of happiness and moments of saddnes just like what happend to joel and what haplend might be reasonble but the outcome was so bad and ellie ended up with nothing. i didn't like abby i understand why she did it but still she killed joel and i will never like her  and being forced to play half of the game as abby and to witness her hypocricy\\, the game developers really tried to get you to like her and that was so obvious with the bad joke and the sudden acts of kindness.Also turning abby into joel and lev into ellie was so bad and pathetic they will never replace them and you know that but you decided to do it anyway.Lev story is no where near Ellie.Ellie was the cure and lev is nothing but a charecter that was forced into the story to make abby an angel.Good luck niel drukmann you will know what you did when the third part is relased and the real price will be paid.These people who played the first part recently and never realised what joel and ellie meant will buy your bad story but the ones that got the last of us to where it is won't.Yes it's your story but it won't mean anything without the people that appreciate it and the real fans did back in 2013.\u00a0those who bought it recently will never give you the hype that was given to you in 2017 to relase this game.Also\\, allow the refunds and then you will realise how great your sales are.Excuse my english it's not my first language.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
