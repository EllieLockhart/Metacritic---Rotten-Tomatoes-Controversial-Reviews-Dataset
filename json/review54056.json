Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I created this account just so I could post a review for this movie.\\n\\nIve been a star wars fan since I was a small child and now approaching middle age I am sorry to say the movie franchise I used to love is now a complete joke.\\n\\nThe last Jedi is a big FU to fans. My biggest gripe with the movie is the portrayal of Luke Skywalker. He was supposed to be the greatest hero of modern mythology but this\\,movie makes him a sad punchline.   The new hero Rey is completely unbelievable  as a character due to somehow being the more powerful than any Jedi without any training or backstory.  Also it was an awful decision to kill off a potentially great villain so early . The plot meanders and really doesn't do the franchise justice. \\n\\nStar Wars is a fantasy and the lore that was created in the previous movies is completely subverted by this one.  Its a real let down. I wont ever pay to see another star wars movie.","true":true}
