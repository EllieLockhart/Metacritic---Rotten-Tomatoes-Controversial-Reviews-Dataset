Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I came into this movie hoping for the best but prepared for the worst based on the many negative fan reviews. Gotta day I really enjoyed it. I\u2019m a pretty cynical guy\\, and at 58 I\u2019ve seen it all sci-fi wise. Followed this franchise since I was in high school in 1977. Great action scenes\\, above average cgi\\, and some damn solid acting. ","true":true}
