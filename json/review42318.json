Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie takes everything we know and love about starwars\\, its heroes\\, its plot and shits on it. And its not just me talking\\, millions are complaining about the same thing. The plot is inconsistent dribble with plot holes\\, its badly written\\, badly acted and badly put together. \\nYou'd think\\, with unlimited funding and resources you'd conjure a decent movie worthy of the franchise.. instead we get a sci-fi version of the room. \\nSuch a waste\\, won't be seeing the third installment in theaters.","true":true}
