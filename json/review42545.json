Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was an inexcusable mess for the amount of source material it had to draw on and its ridiculous budget. Casting\\, dialogue and story were incredibly ridiculous. The casting proves itself a mistake twice over. I've read more nuanced\\, intelligent and cohesive stories and characters from 16-year-old fanfiction writers. Please stop. It's dead!","true":true}
