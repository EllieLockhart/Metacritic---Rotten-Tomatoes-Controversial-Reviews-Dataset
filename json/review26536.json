Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Oh boy\\, there is a lot to unpack here. This film has lot that is different from Force Awakens\\, and has its focus in a very different place as well. There are small and large things to talk about\\, so let's dive in.\\n\\nFirstly\\, the whole movie feels very stagnant. Unlike Empire Strikes back\\, where everything just breaks down\\, this is a story where resources are slowly dwindling down\\, which present some challenges when trying to -\\n\\nHEY\\, THAT'S NOT FAIR. MIDDLE ACTS ARE ALWAYS THE SLOWEST.\\n\\nAh\\, 12-year-old James\\, I was wondering where you had gotten off to.\\n\\nSORRY I'M LATE. I GOT STUCK IN TRAFFIC.\\n\\n...huh? You're 12\\, you don't have a driver's license\\, do you?\\n\\nNOPE.\\n\\n...then how did y-\\n\\nYOU'RE MISSING THE POINT. JUST BECAUSE A MOVIE IS SLOW AND DIFFERENT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT A FUN TIME.\\n\\nRight\\, but I'm saying that\\, compared to the Force Awakens\\, this didn't live up to the hype.\\n\\nNOTHING CAN LIVE UP TO THE HYPE! IT'S A STAR WARS MOVIE\\, IT CAN'T BE PERFECT. PLUS\\, YOU GAVE ATTACK OF THE CLONES 4.5 STARS.\\n\\nFirst off\\, that movie is better than people think. Secondly\\, most of the opinions on that came from you\\, not me.\\n\\nSTOP BEING META. WHAT OTHER GRIPES DO YOU HAVE ABOUT THE LAST JEDI?\\n\\nIt was really long. Extra subplots that took way to long\\, and didn't even pay off. And speaking of paying off\\, some of the big mysteries set up in The Force Awakens were casually discarded here. You can't say that wasn't annoying.\\n\\nOK\\, FINE. IT WAS REALLY ANNOYING NOT TO GET CLOSURE. BUT AT LEAST IT'S TAKING STAR WARS IN A NEW DIRECTION.\\n\\nThis is my point. It's fine to try a new direction\\, but it still has to feel like Star Wars\\, and most of the time\\, it did. I feel like this is going negative. What did you like about the movie?\\nSNOKE'S THRONE ROOM WAS GREAT.\\n\\nIt really was. I actually enjoyed the big payoff moment in there. The scene with Luke at the end was great\\, too.\\n\\nYEAH\\, LUKE WAS AWESOME. KYLO REN WAS PRETTY FANTASTIC\\, TOO.\\n\\nKylo had my favourite arc in the whole movie. He is such a different person at the end than he is at the beginning. Leia was awesome\\, too.\\n\\nWHAT ABOUT FINN AND ROSE?\\n\\nI felt bad\\, because they were in the parts of the film that should have been cut. If you had them not travel to the place they went\\, I bet I would have liked them more.\\n\\nWHAT ABOUT THE HUMOUR? EVERYONE SEEMS TO HAVE AN OPINION ON THAT.\\n\\nI enjoy humour in general (one of the reasons I don't mind the prequel films). I will say that Star Wars humour has always mirrored the humour of its time\\, and that has changed very much in the 10 years since the prequels.\\n\\nALSO\\, OSCAR ISAAC IS GREAT AT COMEDY.\\n\\nYeah\\, I could watch him all day. Hopefully\\, his character can continue to be important in Episode IX.\\n\\nARE YOU SERIOUSLY SPRECULATING ABOUT EPISODE IX ALREADY? THIS IS HOW YOU FEEL LET DOWN BY STAR WARS\\, YOU BUILD IT UP FOR TOO LONG.\\n\\nMaybe we should just take a beat between now and then. See you again in two years?\\n\\nLOOKING FORWARD TO IT. HOPEFULLY BY THEN\\, I'LL BE ABLE TO DRIVE.\\n\\nConsdering that you seemingly haven't aged since you last appeared two years ago\\, I'm doubtful.\\n\\nI SAID STOP BEING META.\\n\\nTechnically\\, I think that was lampshade hanging\\, but I'll stop. See you for Episode IX!","true":true}
