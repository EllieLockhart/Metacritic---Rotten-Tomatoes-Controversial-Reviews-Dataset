Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok this movie is definitely flawed I won\u2019t ignore that\\, but the overall story had me watching so intently that I couldn\u2019t look away. I swear my jaw was on the ground for half the movie. Some people didn\u2019t like the direction that Rian Johnson took\\, but apart from a very few things\\, I really enjoyed the way he did it. I\u2019ve never been more surprised (in a good way) by a Star Wars movie. I just hope JJ Abrams does a satisfying job on Episode IX. like I said\\, definitely flawed\\, but enjoyable nonetheless. Easily the best since Empire. I rate it 8.5\/10. Currently my 3rd favorite Star Wars movie\\, with A new hope 2nd\\, and Empire 1st. ","true":true}
