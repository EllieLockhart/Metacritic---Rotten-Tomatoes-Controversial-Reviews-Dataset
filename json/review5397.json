Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite early low ratings from viewers\\, this movie lands big and ranks up there with The Empire Strikes Back in my opinion. Yes\\, Star Wars is going in a different direction\\, which it seems many fans are resisting\\, but this story is a fantastic addition to the saga. I will see it again and again and enjoy both an homage to the past as well as an extremely promising future for this franchise.  Kudos to Disney & Rian Johnson!","true":true}
