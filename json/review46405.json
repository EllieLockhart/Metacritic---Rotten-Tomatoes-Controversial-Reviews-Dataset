{"101487":193700,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-08","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was really disapointed with the last jedi. All the fan speculation around \\\"grey jedi\\\" I had hoped that the evolution of the franchise would see force users become more complicated than good and bad\\, light and dark. The last jedi was a chance for a more balanced pespective. Even Snoke highlighting that balance in the force ment that as kylo got more powerful the force would balance out with a light side counter-part\\, it seems obvious that the solution is to embrace both sides of the coin\\, we see this train of thought play out in the animated series starwars rebels and would of been a much more humanizing narative that \\\"oh I'm a good guy and your a bad guy\\\" as we all have light and dark aspects within us.\\n\\nDirection aside\\, the movie really dropped the bar in so many areas its hard to list them. The lack martial arts and prowess? what makes star wars great is that the force is a plot mechanic that enables powerful characters to perform otherwise unbeliveble feats of tactics\\, precision and skill. None of the characters (shy of the cringeworthy ghost image of luke's shoehorned 'epic limbo' dodge of kylo's broadsword swing) actually convay any resemblance of combat ability\\, force users or otherwise.\\n\\nThe lone light fighter disarming an entire dreadnought?\\n\\nThe space chase and running low on fuel sacrificing everyone? here is an idea\\, why not split up? the ship that is being tracked gets followed and the rest escape... why does the resistance have 0 tactical prowess? I mean they are suposed to be rebels\\, not novices.\\n\\nLuke? a jedi\\, acting on fear? the thing that his ENTIRE training focused on shield agaisnt because it leads to the dark side. Magically apearing\\, Magically disapearing. The movie could of cut Luke Skywalker entirely\\, had fin crash into the cannon instead and I actually think it would of been an improvement.\\n\\nSnoke? words cannot translate the utter failure of this character. Here we have a dark-side user so powerful he can force choke people across space\\, manipulate the minds of two of the most powerful force users alive and he gets killed easier than your regular storm trooper? please.\\n\\nSpeaking of storm troopers\\, is Fin an anomaly? In the previous movie its the death of another trooper that triggers his defection\\, lets gloss over the fact that he then has no problem killing his fellow troopers throughout the movie without a single care given. If Fin humanizes the storm troopers\\, why is this concept not fleshed out more? they are people\\, not mindless clones or robots but people\\, yet they just fall back into this background role of being target practice and being unable to hit anyone\\, disposable just like any rebel pilot that we have not seen prior until they are in a formation with our protaganists leading the charge to their deaths.\\n\\nWhat actually happend in this movie? The rebels got wiped out to the point inwhich they can all fit onto a single ship (the falcon) and Snoke is (like every sith lord) killed by his aprentice... Yet its \\\"just the start of the battle\\\" and \\\"the rebels have everything they need now to win\\\".... are we watching the same series of events as the characters?\\n\\noh and don't forget luke after seeing yoda's force ghost manipulate the weather and his astral projection fights in a light saber battle comes to the realization that he dosn't even need a body and if anything he will become more powerful as a ghost than an actual living being... I mean a jedi that can still use all his abilities\\, be anywhere they want that cannot be cut down by a sabre or hit with a blaster? So they are an invinceable\\, unstopable\\, weather controlling\\, omnipitant being tied to a force that connects everything together? Yeah because that is not overpowered at all?\\n\\nTLDR; The Last Jedi was written and produced by people who don't have a clue\\, its got all the familiar visuals with none of the underpinning that held the starwars universe together\\, if you removed the familar characters and props the entire film could be some standalone sci-fi movie of space bad guys hunting down space good guys and winning.","true":true}
