This game shook me to the core and left me emotionally wrecked by the time I completed the story; Naughty Dog has done a great job of getting the player invested in the game and its characters and has made a valiant effort in exploring parallel narratives that force you to empathise with both perspectives of the story so far. The gameplay\\, albeit very similar to the original game\\, has vastly improved in fluidity\\, animations\\, and does a great job of providing the player options to explore\\, take multiple routes\\, and discover the world around them in a much more natural manner (compared to the prequel). The combat is also an impressive step up from the first game; each encounter flawlessly creates an atmosphere of tension and fear that I haven't felt to such a degree in games I've played before. The stealth system has improved\\, the player has more freedom of movement\\, and weapon customizations and character upgrades allow you to choose which playstyle suits you best. Oh\\, and need I mention the graphics?\r\rBut more about the story - as aforementioned I thoroughly enjoyed it\\, it does a great job at forcing the player to reflect on their decisions and look at the conflict from various perspectives. Without spoiling too much: halfway through the game\\, there is a somewhat sudden shift to a parallel narrative that was taking place throughout your playthrough up till that point. This part of the game is what is a turn off for many players\\, as they find the jump too jarring and out of place. Although I disagree\\, I do see where they're coming from and do acknowledge the slight pacing issues that are a consequence of this twist. There is also a certain fight sequence right before the epilogue of the game which didn't quite sit right with me\\, but I can't say much without spoiling the story.\r\rOverall\\, I think this game is nothing short of a masterpiece\\, and much like the prequel is a giant leap forward for storytelling in video games. The best advice I can give you is to go in with an open mind\\, and you'll certainly love it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
