Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney's efforts at manipulating audience scores (and therefore luring more people to the theaters) should be exposed and investigated. We are talking about massive fraud.\\nThe reviews are public and I am talking about FACTS. And fact is that in correspondence to the opening of The Last Jedi and following days\\, the reviews and scores on Rotten Tomatoes\\, Metacritics and IMDB were ALL positive\\, giving the movie the maximum score.\\nAfter the movie screening finished\\, the critics and the ratings went down like a giant lead ball. How come?\\nFact is that lots of people look at the audience critics before going to Cinemas\\, and decide consequently. \\nDisney paid a number of individuals (maybe an entire call-center) to flood the critics sites with positive and enthusiastic (although one-liners) critics and extremely high scores.\\nWhen screening ended\\, they had no need to inflate the score anymore and the REAL critics and scores started to get in. Now they are ALL negative (except a very few one-liners that look extremely suspicious).\\nSo what? Shame on you! Disney! You knew from the very beginning that this movie was a shit. This only explains the massive campaign you paid for at the very beginning of the screening. A campaign which you stopped abruptly as soon as your goal was accomplished. \\nI hope you will regret bitterly your deliberate (and inexplicable) destruction of an entire universe.","true":true}
