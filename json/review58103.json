Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst. Star. Wars. Movie. Ever. As a fan of 40 years of story\\, I am offended that the makers of this movie would be so arrogant as to think they could throw away 40 years of history as if it means nothing. And that doesn't even bring into account the MULTIPLE plot holes\\, unanswered questions\\, anti-climactic resolutions and just plain terrible storytelling. You have the juggernaut of Disney and all it's billions of dollars and resources and storytellers and you can't make a tight\\, well-paced\\, solid story? Really?!?! You should be ashamed Disney. Congratulations on your new billion-dollar movie. Green apparently can make you overlook a lot of things. Maybe you'll be lucky and I'll be the only 40-year-fan you lost with this movie.","true":true}
