{"101487":196293,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where to begin? First this is the worst fukin blockbuster\\, star wars and fan film I have seen this year\\, its worse than Justice League or that Murder on Orient Express crap. This is not a star wars film\\, let alone a film. Rian Johnson and Disney has managed to do what George Lucas couldn't do\\, which is utterly sanitised Star Wars into a toy commerical with cheesy cliches\\, barren plot with no story\\, dumbed down social commentary and a joke - a very long joke for the money in your pockets. I really feel sorry and sad for Lucas at this stage\\, the guy is decent and cared about his myth\\, but its finally over\\, Star Wars is finished at this point. Everything about this film is rubbish\\, the music\\, cinematography\\, fighting\\, lore\\, characters\\, dialogue\\, lighting\\, plot\\, argh every fukin thing is rubbish. Lets begin with the massive dumpster pile of flaws:\\n\\n1) The film itself - technical filmmaking. This is by far one of the worst edited movies I have seen since Suicide Squad. People were bitching about how bad Rogue one editing was\\, but no no\\, wait until you see this dumpster fire of shit. What essentially happens is that you have 3 plots running in this film for like an hour and a half. Within some of these subplots\\, there are further subplots within them to introduce new characters and ideas. You might think a director could balance them well like what happens in Empire Strikes Back and even with the prequels\\, but sadly you are wrong. Instead you get to watch scenes of different lengths gel together with little connectivity and are generally bore fest of exposition. At the heart of the film should be about Rey and Luke\\, but this rubbish of a film manages to bypass a large chunk of their training and diaglogue\\, instead but focusing the miniscule 'Resistance' (at this point I dont even know how many people are in it\\, it just makes no sense) running away from the First Order who seem to can't take them out immediately. We get scenes cut across other scenes\\, no tension is built. and hardly any flow as to time and space in which the events occur. Honestly\\, the editing is so bad that at one point we get 10 seconds of Finn\\, suddenly like a minute of rey before cutting back to Finn storyline again. ITs so incoherent and fukin bad that it will give you a spase by the end.\\n\\nTechncially the plot doesn't go anywhere for a large chunk of the way\\, with the worst jokes littered every 10 minutes. General hux is reduced to general hugs and the audience is supposed to laugh at this whilst the resistance is about to be blown up. The film story is laugable simple which is that the resistance is running away from a bigger ship. That is it. Nothing new\\, nothing special\\, its just Empire Strikes Back reduced to a fucking chase sequence that doesnt even feel like a chase sequence because they keep telling us they have like hours to go by. The film also jumps to so many different places and minor events that tension never builds. Theres a particular bad leap of logic at the end\\, where after Rey battles Kylo and escpaes\\, its never shown how she gets to the millenium falcon and then suddenly comes to Crait undetected with a fucking fleet of First Order ships. She then magically disappears for most of the battle\\, whilst the film focuses on Poe and Leia bitching\\, whilst the black and asian character decides to see who can committ kamakazi the quickest. She then magically comes back to lift some rocks before meeting Poe for the first time. Yes that because we have to remember these characters actually never met until now after 5 hours of screen time in this triology. Its so awful and cringe that I wanted to die. There are so many plot contrivances like this throughout the film\\, like BB8 magically espcaing and using a walker to let Rey espcae\\, people flying in and out undetected\\, some awful character motivations like why does General Holo (the purple lady) just tell Poe the plan all along.\\n\\nDialogue lines are so wooden that they feel like from a Ps2 game\\, definitely watch the scenes with Rey and how shit of an actress she is giving some of the worst written dialogue since Attack of the Clone. There are no emotional stakes in this film\\, nor is there any entertainment. Scenes that almost show tension are almost inevtiable cut to something else in a split second\\, and also characters seem to come and go as they please. Whilst the Canto blight world intiially might seem interesting\\, it is by far one of the worst subplots in history as it goes nowhere but becomes a Greenpeace SAFE commerical about racing horses. Honestly\\, its such a fukin disaster I forgot why the two characers who miraculosuly meet in another random scene\\, decided to go as we all know how incompetent they are.\\n\\n2) How fuckin boring this film is When you watch star wars as a kid\\, even with the prequels\\, I would never ever fucking accuse those films being boring. Why? Because it had meaningful character interactions\\, cool characters and amazing fight scenes. Although this film has like two light saber battles\\, one space battle and one ground battle\\, this was by far the worst action I have ever seen. None of the fights had stakes and they all felt like fight choreography. This is particularly true with the main fight scene in Snokes room where Spoiler snokes just gets killed mid conversation by Kylo before his stupid body guards tries to fight the pair but end up feeling like a jackie chan movie scene. Theses are not light saber battles nor are they anything but boring CGI work. That is particular evident in the space battle where we never track the resistance fighters\\, nor dog to dog battles\\, instead all the bombers at the start gets destoryed quick before the mcguffin last bomber miraculosly offloads its payload to destroy the dreadnought we only see for like 7 mins. Rogue One had a space batttle 500x better than this shit. Its so fucking terrible by the end of the film\\, which is the battle of crait\\, which is a 100% rip off from Hoth\\, none of it is interesting\\, we dont even see soliders dying or anything. Its just they get blasted and we follow the dumbest skid pods that do absolutely fukcing nothing. All of this is in service of the plot so that the resistance can run away yet again - but this time with only fuckning 10 people. Yes\\, that right\\, after Force Awakens you thought they had an army\\, it turns out the resistance was made up of fucking 50 people at most. This gets me to the next biggest pile of dump which is how this film literally destorys the star wars lore and the whole point of force awakens.\\n\\n3) Last Piece of shit Jedi literally shits on the cannon and the lore of this trilogy. As bad as the prequels were\\, it never took a shit on the lore except for midichlorians and maybe a whinny Anakin. Here the last Jedi manages to bypass anything interesting that the Force Awakens sets up and destory any credibility of lore that existed. How to start? Remember when we all speculated who Rey could be\\, well in less than a minute\\, we are told that Rey's parents are nobodies and yes she is in fact a Mary Sue. I was opened mouth when this happened. I had defended the fact that Star wars had always been about individuals of Skywalker\\, Palpatine or Kenobi or special heritage that made Rey special with the force hence her importance. Here instead\\, this film subverts any logic by saying that shes a nobody which means all that fighting and force ability she just does in FA is a fucking joke. Disney and Johnson thinks they are very clever with this\\, but this is just a cop out\\, its pure lazyness and a lack of any logical application of lore or imagination. A freaking 5 year could have thought of a better back story\\, instead\\, we get this disgusting treatment of the whole point of the jedi and the force. Remember when we thought snoke could be somebody important or important to the story\\, well he just dies in the middle of the film. We know nothing about him\\, how he rose\\, whats the plot or his barebone motivations of just killing Luke. Its so fucking disgusting that it makes Lucas's disregard of the OT seem like nothing. Luke Skywalker also manages to die in the end for no fucking reason\\, Leia can now survive in space and float back to spaceship like MArry Poppins\\, everything about the Resistance and First Order are not explained and we have no idea what the scale of their operation is. Last Jedi confirms what I always thought\\, which was that the is triology has no idea what it wants to do or how it expands the mythos of the Star Wars universe\\, instead\\, it just shits on it and say here you go\\, heres what \\\"YOU DIDNT EXPECT DID YOU\\\". What happend to the Knights of Ren - no mention of it? Luke can suddenly create a force vision millions of stars away and then die for no reason. Rey donest even get trained in this film\\, let alone how to fucking fight. Honestly Im so mad and angry at this shit lore killer that I think we might have to officially remove this trilogy as part of the cannon one day. I will definitely not let my kids see this tragedy.\\n\\nI don't know. Im shaken with disbelief how this film was greenlighted or even made. Mark Hamill was right\\, this is a complete misstep. Its not even the slightest entertaining given how generic it is. Its fucking sad. Its terrible. Its disgusting. I never felt this way towards a film\\, let alone a franchise that gave people joy and hope as to why science fiction\\, religious themes\\, nature and films can be a great thing. Well done Disney\\, well fucking done. You've done it. Youve managed to make the Last Jedi the last fucking Star Wars film Ill probably watch. Episode 9 wont save this\\, nor the terrible but inevtiable han solo film. Rogue one was a miracle. This so-called Trilogy is sad and disgusting. May the force fucking kill your company.","true":true}
