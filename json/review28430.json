Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pretend it\u2019s one big dream sequence. A friend who saw the original with me back in 1977 told me Star Wars ended for him after Return of The Jedi. I liked The Force Awakens but this movie does a huge disservice to all of us captured by the magic of the originals. What a huge disappointment. ","true":true}
