Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you're a fanboy (or girl) desperately holding on to your childhood\\, you won't like this movie. If you like what Star Wars has always stood for\\, or if you like good movies in general\\, you'll love this one. This is a Star Wars for grown-ups. See ya\\, kid.","true":true}
