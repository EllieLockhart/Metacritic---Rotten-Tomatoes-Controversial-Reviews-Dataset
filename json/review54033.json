Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't give my true feelings without spoiling it but I'll try to get as close as I can.  While not nearly as good as Empire the movie was still good and opens up interesting avenues for the next movie to explore. \\n\\nThere are two MAJOR revelations in the movie both of which were pretty disappointing.  One of which I think was disappointing simply because I had a lot of preconceived notions of how it should turn out. The other was actually pretty disappointing and ultimately I feel was a giant wasted opportunity. \\n\\nThe only other thing I didn't care for but wasn't awful was the Canto Bight side story.  I felt it was a little drawn out and could have taken a lot less time. \\n\\nEven though it wasn't perfect it was still a good movie. There were moments that made me feel like a kid again watching the original trilogy for the first time.  It's no where near a perfect movie but also much much MUCH better than the prequels.","true":true}
