Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't care all that much for episode 7 because it was too much like A New Hope. I liked this one even less. I just don't find these new characters all that interesting. You wait until the end of the second movie for Luke to finally do something and when he finally does it leaves you wanting more.","true":true}
