Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not 100% sure about the logic of \\\"moving forward\\\" on one of the most beloved franchises in movie history by not only erasing all of the triumphs of the original movies but also seeming to go out of the way to demean and denigrate it's heroes and specifically alienate the fanbase that kept it going for 40 years.\\n\\nThis wasn't Star Wars: it was an insulting dismantling of it. In abandoning the mythology and morality of the franchise (while continually urging us to burn the past\\, no less!) the Disney franchise is nothing more or less than an imposter\\, an expensive knock off.\\n\\nYou could literally fed the cast alphabet soup and had them defecate a better story than what Disney delivered here.","true":true}
