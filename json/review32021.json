Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS the movie was below expectations. it was good\\, not great. i loved the plot with rey and kylo connecting but it built up to nothing when they still went their separate ways. still no origin of snoke\\, no idea who he is or where he came from so why should we care when he dies? the plot with rose and finn flat out sucked. overall though the action sequences were great\\, cgi was good (besides the yoda scene)\\, and the concept was good. definitely better than the force awakens but falls shy of rogue one.","true":true}
