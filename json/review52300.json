Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A good film but not a great one. The plot is confused and oddly paced\\, there are two separate ticking clocks that rob the film of any particular stakes or tension.\\n\\nThere's a cutaway that really serves no purpose other than to occupy some of the main cast and seemingly showcase some aliens and cgi. Theres some quippy dialogue\\, but it's rather flailing and misses as often as it hits.\\n\\nThe film itself is pretty enough\\, well shot and well performed. It's a fine action film\\, but not what I expected from the second film in a saga","true":true}
