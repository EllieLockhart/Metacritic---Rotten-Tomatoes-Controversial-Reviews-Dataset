Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It improves on the TFA where that film felt like a wave of nostalgia and felt unoriginal this movie felt original in theme and tone while still riding on that nostalgia wave. My biggest complaints was the opening scenes attempt at humor(felt too much like star wars rebels)\\, the lack of aliens as  background or supporting characters(like DJ should've been an alien) and the snoke story-line being fizzled out so soon but overall I didn't get much of the hate or complaints this film got. I liked seeing a broken Luke\\, them explore new Jedi abilities\\, see the dynamic relation ship between Rey\\, and Kylo  the film isn't perfect but I feel most people didn't like it because its not what they expected and thats why I liked the movie I hope and time maybe if the next film is a success that people revisit this movie and see it in a better light.","true":true}
