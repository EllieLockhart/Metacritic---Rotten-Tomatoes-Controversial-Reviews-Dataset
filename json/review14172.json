{"101487":132931,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-02","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you were used to dream when watching a Star Wars movie\\, be sure that Mickey and Rian Johnson ended it.\\nBefore I keep writing\\, I apologize for my English\\, not my mother tongue. I'd like to say that I do not enjoy writing this review\\, it is a way to express my feelings (at the lowest after watching TLJ) and especially my disappointment.\\nWhat follows is 100% SPOIL.\\nLet's start with Poe in its X-Wing who destroys on its own all surface canons of an ironclad cruiser of the first order. Without the TIE fighters\\, he would not have been hurt at all. Then the bombers (where are the Y-Wing?)\\, especially slow while they move in space and drop their bombs as if some high gravity is attracting them on the cruiser.\\nGross humour takes place during the whole movie and starts with Finn\\, waking up and falling in its healing suit full of bakta. Target here is 10 years old kids\\, that's ok\\, but please try to think about every kind of fans\\, the oldest ones are at least 45 (I'm 30).\\nBut I must say (after watching the last Marvel movies) that this gross humour is now typical of Disney and that it spreads faster than a mortal plague in a zombies movie...\\nSpeaking of Finn\\, it must have been really annoying to be a stormtrooper\\, I understand why he deserted\\, he was cleaning either the Starkiller base\\, either Snoke's personnal destroyer. So he knows by heart the plans of the base and the destroyer\\, isn't it amazing?\\nRey\\, my opinion is that she got a better performance in the 7th\\, maybe J.J. Abrams directed her in a better way\\, maybe she wanted to meet a Jedi master and not an old recluse and frightened hermit. Her role is useless during the first half of the movie. And for the rest of it\\, it is solo Jedi bootcamp but who cares? No one needs to train to become a Jedi.\\nLuke\\, a shameful scenario for a great Jedi. First thing we easily guess\\, he did cut his link to the Force\\, so he does not know that Han Solo\\, his best friend\\, is dead\\, and he does not even feel bad more than 10 seconds... So we learn that Luke\\, who did resist Sidious\\, did beat Vador in a duel\\, did get Vador's redemption\\, did hide away liek a coward! He could not resist waving is light saber in front of its nephew and apprentice Ben Solo\\, then he just leaves\\, and everybody can rub along on its own. Really the Jedi master we see at the end of the 6th\\, what a joke!\\nSecond insult to Luke Skywalker character\\, when he gets back Anakin's light saber\\, he just throw it away\\, once again I suspect some gross humour attempt. But that was one little good moment to be solemn.\\nGenerally speaking\\, it is unexpected to see Luke close his eyes on the problems of the rebels\\, of oppressed worlds\\, of Leia... but it is not an interesting twist\\, it is just a way for Rian Johnson to make Luke look ridiculous.\\nAnd Leia\\, who bearly shows her link to the Force in the 7th\\, is now on \\\"god-like\\\" mode. She survives two missiles and a little tour in the space (you know\\, with the Mary Poppins archive images...) and she recovers quite good!\\nPoor Yoda\\, Rian Johnson is mistaking him for Zeus. It is a good thing that he is worried about Rey\\, but what about Ben Solo\\, where was he when he was (seemingly) turned to the dark side by Snoke? Does he have a crush on Rey? Ridiculous.\\nBy the way\\, do you see who Snoke is? Yes\\, the dummy who's gicing orders to Kylo Ren\\, he looks like an old creepy in a golden dressing gown. No background for this character\\, but yes I forgot\\, dark lords of the sith\\, or just even dark side masters\\, appears from time to time without any reason.\\nSnoke is a monster in its mastering of the Force but he does not see that Kylo Ren is turning the light saber in its direction. Kylo Ren does not detect Luke's illusion in the end\\, we might think then that Luke is a very powerful Jedi master\\, but one needs to remember he did hide away after some hesitation to kill his apprentice because he was afraid of him... total nonsense!\\nThe final scene\\, with the hammer canon\\, it was a good time to see something epic and dramatic\\, some heroic moment\\, with Finn trying to save the rest of the rebels. But Rose did hurt his speeder (how? she was not even at the same level...). And then the minions don't even finish them\\, at a really close range. But no\\, it is Mickey power of love (might be copyrighted...) that is going to save the universe\\, and in the meantime let's comdamn the rest of the rebels to a terrible death (they don't know yet that Luke is \\\"present\\\").\\nLuke's illusion\\, when I stiil thought it was really him\\, let me hope for an epic final duel\\, but no\\, and the other idiot did fall for it. And then Luke just dies\\, like this\\, in a non heroic\\, non epic\\, non dramatic way. Luke deserved a scene like for Vador in Rogue One (excellent movie by th way).\\nLet's talk about the background of Kylo Ren. Done\\, let's continue.\\nI think you all saw how much miracles appened in this movie (not speaking about the Force)\\, you can then see the moral of this story: if you are in a really bad position\\, please hold the line\\, let everyone else die and some gross twist will save you!\\nAs a conclusion\\, this \\\"episode\\\" looks like its characters\\, ridiculous\\, tasteless\\, a long litany of inconsistencies and insults. I trully believe that one can innovate\\, while keeping kind memories of the past\\, without copy pasting it like J.J. Abrams and without trolling it like Rian Johnson.","true":true}
