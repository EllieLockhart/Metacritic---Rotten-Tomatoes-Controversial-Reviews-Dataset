Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I created this account just so I could post my review on TLJ. I am not a bot! I saw TLJ on Dec. 14 and have been numb and angry since then.  I have loved Star Wars for 40 years.  I introduced my husband to Star Wars 22 years ago and we introduced our sons to Star Wars when they were very young. What Rian Johnson\\, Kathleen Kennedy and Disney have done is unforgivable!!!  TLJ was a slap in the face to all those fans who have loved the movies\\, characters and lore.  As a sat and watched with my husband and two sons-a part of me died.  I am not looking forward to Episode IX\\, unless TLJ is re-done.  There were so many plot holes\\, questions unanswered\\, no character consistency and rules established in previous films were disregarded.  I have never sat through a Star Wars movie and asked myself \\\"How much longer until this movie is over?\\\" \\, until now.","true":true}
