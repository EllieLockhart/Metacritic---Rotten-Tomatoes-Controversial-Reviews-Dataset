Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In my opinion this is THE WORST movie of all time. There are so many plot holes and inconsistencies it ruins the movie. Also the everyone except fin sucks\\, and I mean everyone new characters and old ones. They ruined Luke\\, C3-P0\\, and Leia! And the new characters are all boring bland and 1 bad note. Rey\\, garbage... Po\\, garbage. Rose\\, hot garbage. Even BB8 is bad and be does not even speak!","true":true}
