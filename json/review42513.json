Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was amazing to say the least. I am utterly shocked by the negativity it has received. I understand it shot down a lot of what we were interested in but it also showed that Star Wars is taking a new direction. This is what will make the series much more interesting. Overall this movie had action\\, adventure\\, tragedy\\, failure\\, as well as success. What really bothers me is hearing that the good guys did't always succeed but that is just life and no one always succeeds.","true":true}
