Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hate that Luke becomes a grumpy old man and dies at the end\\, he is the chosen one for Pete's sake! I hated the hole casino scene too\\, rose seemed very thrust into it all\\, and they could have done so much more with Snoke.\\nall in all\\, it does not compare to Rouge One.","true":true}
