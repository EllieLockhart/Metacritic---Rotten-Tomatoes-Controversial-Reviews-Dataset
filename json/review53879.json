Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hopefully JJ Abrams can save the franchise from the damage Johnson just inflicted! Still can't believe that they had a slow speed outer space chase waiting for the fuel to run out as one of the plot lines! They are living off the excitement of having to wait two years for this episode\\, and the possible plot twists for who Snoke is and who Rey's parents were. Once the initial hoopla over opening weekend passes and more people have a chance to digest how badly Johnson did with those plot twists and leaving absolutely nothing for the next episode\\, you will see the more and more negative reviews. Don't get me wrong\\, it was an ok movie\\, and I can understand why some people will like it\\, but the way Johnson directed this movie almost seems like he was telling JJ Abrams to go to hell with the way you wanted to take this new trilogy\\, and I'm going to leave you with nothing for your episode!","true":true}
