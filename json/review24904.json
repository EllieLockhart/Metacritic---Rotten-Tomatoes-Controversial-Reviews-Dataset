Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My favorite Star Wars movie since Empire! Fresh ideas\\, amazing character development\\, and a script that makes you consider the larger picture beyond the trials of the central characters. It reminds us that even our greatest heroes are still flawed\\, and that is okay. Watching them learn from their failures and rise above them has always been been one of my favorite tropes of the Star Wars films. Lastly\\, the film challenges some of our binary ideas of light and dark in a galaxy far\\, far away...paving the way for more exciting development in the final film of the Skywalker saga.","true":true}
