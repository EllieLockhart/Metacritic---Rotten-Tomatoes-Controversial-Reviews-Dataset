Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Now I know what it is like to have my soul crushed by the force.\\\"  That was my first comment after seeing the movie.  After 'Rogue One' became my favorite star wars movie to date\\, I cant begin to explain how much of a let down this movie was.  It is not that great of a movie\\, but absolute hot garbage as a star wars move.  Horribly written characters for one.  Poe\\, Rose\\, and Holdo were bad\\, but the enemies\\, good god.  Instead of cold\\, calculated\\,  and menacing\\, we got a bunch of incompetent morons.  There was also endless plot holes\\, and endless overly silly or corny scenes.  The overall tone of the movie was just weird.  It is like they tried to make poorly written avengers move\\, except the overly goofy tone that works in superhero movies\\, just doesn't fit star wars at all.","true":true}
