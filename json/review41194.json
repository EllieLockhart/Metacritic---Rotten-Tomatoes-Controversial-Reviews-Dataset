Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has slot of great moments and really fixes what the Force Awakens gets wrong. However despite a lot of cool opportunities this movie makes it makes equa.l amoll of wasted moments and characters. Luke and Rey's subplot is never fully realized. Rey's parentage anticlimactic and raises questions on whether the prophecy about Luke holds any merit. Snoke is killed without explanation of who he is and where he came from. Captain Phasma is literally and figuratively wasted in this film. Del Toros character shows promise then we learn he is the worst of the worst by the. End I'm thinking what was the point.","true":true}
