Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars is dead now. It resembles nothing of what it used to be. I liked the force awakens and I was really looking forward to the Last Jedi. But the Last Jedi did not have any connection to the force awakens. It is as if it is its own movie.\\n In addition it seems like Ryan Johnson had no idea how the force worked. One more thing Ray is literally a superhero. She didn't have to train or anything was able to manhandle Luke Skywalker and have amazing force abilities. Oh yeah and Luke Skywalker was portrayed as a potential murderer and a coward.  In my opinion Kathleen Kennedy and Ryan Johnson both need to be fired. The Last Jedi needs to be stricken from Canon. And I want my time money back!\\n\\nAnd another thing just came to my mind. The side quest on Canto Bight did not help the main plot at all! And you can't weaponize light speed if you do why not just have Lightspeed missiles and take out the other enemies ships. This movie was awful","true":true}
