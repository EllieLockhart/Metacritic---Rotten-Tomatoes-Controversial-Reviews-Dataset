Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its a film you might like if you're a fanboy of the Star Wars franchise. If you look at the film outside of that lens though as a standalone science fiction\/action film\\, its mediocrity shines through the soulless references and callbacks.","true":true}
