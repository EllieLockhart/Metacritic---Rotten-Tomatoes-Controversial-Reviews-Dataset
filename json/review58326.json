Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Acting feels forced (I don't think anything with Fin doesn't feel forced)\\, shallow character development\\, and the MMO-like side quests. \\nIf feels like they just wanted to erase the \\\"problematic\\\" original trilogy and start over\\, but keep the Star Wars name. You can see it in how they treat the original heroes and how they undermine every bit of progress or accomplishment made in the original trilogy.\\nThis is one of those movies in which the more you think about it\\, the worse it gets.","true":true}
