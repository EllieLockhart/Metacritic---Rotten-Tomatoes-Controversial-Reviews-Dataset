Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic movie!  To pull of plot twists that caught legions of Star Wars fans who have obsessed about plot twists for 40 years is a feat.  They set up the last movie to not be forced into an obvious conclusion. That is quality storytelling.","true":true}
