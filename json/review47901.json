Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While entertaining as movie in isolation\\, this movie makes clear that Disney does not have a plan for the trilogies\\, and that they are making it up as they go.  Mysteries established by Abrams go nowhere with Johnson's movie.  Luke's rationale on the Jedi ending is absurd.  Evil doesn't exist as a reaction to righteousness. It a manifestation of selfish desires.","true":true}
