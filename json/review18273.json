Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought the latest Star Wars movie was a lot of fun. If you don't dig too deep and obsess over details. There were a few things that could have been done better\\, and it ran a little too long\\, but the character development was pretty solid. I hope that some of the \\\"reveals\\\" in the movie turn out to be feints\\, much like Obi Wan telling Luke that his father was dead in the original Star Wars: A New Hope. But time will tell how it holds up.","true":true}
