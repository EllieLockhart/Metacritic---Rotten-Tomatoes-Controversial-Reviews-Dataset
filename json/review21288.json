Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i went in with low expectations and still managed to be disappointed. i'm a woman\\, a long-time OT and PT fan\\, someone who loves diversity and strong women in films\\, and even i agree that the 'diversity' SW is pushing has come at the cost of plot and character development\\, throwing in dozens of new characters without fleshing any of them out enough for the audience to grow attached to them\\, or care about them at all; all while killing off the original characters that we HAVE come to love so much.\\n\\nget a grip disney\\, 'manbabies' aren't the only people complaining about the complete mockery you've made of a beloved franchise and its  characters. start listening to your fans before it's too late.","true":true}
