Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If I could have given this a zero I would have. For all the same reasons as the other reviews\\, as a longtime fan of Star Wars I felt that the new move completely disregarded everything we've come to love in the series\\, and placed ill-timed\\, awkward humor in it to boot. Though the actors are incredible\\, I felt the poor directing really made their performances stiff and unconvincing\\, especially in the beginning of the film. It feels as though all the characters have changed\\, with no development to explain why or to justify it.","true":true}
