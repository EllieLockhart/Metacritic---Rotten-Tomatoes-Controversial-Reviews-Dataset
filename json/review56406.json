Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Absolute Worse Star Wars Movie To Date. It had so much potential. This was just really\\, really bad on so many levels. What makes it so terrible I think\\, is knowing just how amazing it could have and should have been. Oh well\\, hopefully Disney can learn a hard lesson before it's too late. Don't screw with Star Wars. Yes you bought it\\, but you were given a gift and a huge responsibility with this saga. The originals were not produced for the sake of making money. The originals were the dreams of George Lucas and a bunch of other amazing people. Please take a deep breath Disney and slow down on cranking out a bunch of Star Wars brand name films that are going to eventually be the death of a thriving franchise. I personally feel that they should not release it on blu ray\\, but should totally rewrite the entire film and just forget this whole thing ever happened.","true":true}
