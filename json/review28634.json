Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pros: Great cinematography and special effets. Action-packed movie with a good amount of twists and turns to keep things interesting. Adam Driver's performance as Kyle Ren is a highlight\\, as well as Carrie's last performance as Leia.\\n\\nCons: Story and characters are nonsensical to the point of breaking immersion. Some characters do not act like in previous movies and no good explanation is given to justify this change. Countless plot contrivances and some serious plot holes. One of the main b-plots is completely pointless. Some dialogue is poorly written. Ridley's performance is subpar at points. Boyega is wasted. Overall is not a good movie\\, and it has nothing to do with main character being a female or POC in the movie. It's just not a good movie\\, period.","true":true}
