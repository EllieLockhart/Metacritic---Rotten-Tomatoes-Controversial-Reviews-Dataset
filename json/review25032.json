Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My sister is 24 years old. She is not an avid movie-watcher\\, but remembers watching the original Star Wars trilogy. She went with me to the Last Jedi. She was incredibly confused: not because of her lack of knowledge on the current trilogy\\, but because of the original Star Wars hero. She didn't realize that Mark Hamill's portrayal was supposed to be that of an older Luke Skywalker. She asked me if she missed something important because she remembered Luke as a strong character to look up to and this new character was squirrelly and ridiculous. Rian Johnson messed up. If a person can't comprehend that the character your writing is the icon of the entire franchise\\, then you messed up.","true":true}
