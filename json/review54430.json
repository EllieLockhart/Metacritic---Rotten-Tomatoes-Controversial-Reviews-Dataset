Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked this movie. I thought it was pretty good. I don't need some movie that fits the traditional Star Wars mold perfectly. I loved how this movie flipped everything around. There are no more by definition \\\"jedi\\\" and no by definition \\\"sith\\\" anymore. The lines have almost blurred too much. Also\\, we find out that Rey does not fit into this puzzle that is the Star Wars family. She is instead just a nobody. Everyone is complaining about this\\, but I think it's brilliant. The whole idea is that you don't have to belong to this one family to be force sensitive. You don't have to belong to a glorious family with a rich force history. Just like we saw with that little slave boy at the end\\, you don't need to have an extraordinary background to become force sensitive. I thought the movie had a good story line\\, a nice color palette\\, and good enough characters to keep me engaged. To end with\\, if you are one of those people who claim this isn't a \\\"Star Wars movie\\\" then what is? Some sad copy of the original trilogy?","true":true}
