Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely despise all that Disney has done in all three of the \\\"Star Wars\\\" \\\"movies\\\". It doesnt fit anything the last 6 movies have done and I am holding out a small bit of hope that the new disney CEO completely cuts these movies out forever and always.","true":true}
