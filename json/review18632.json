Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It never ceases to amaze me how critics will praise terrible movies if they exist within franchises they are fond of. The biggest problem here is that Last Jedi is just plain boring. It isn't just a bad Star Wars movie\\, it's an incomprehensible piece of junk. We jump from one boring story thread to another and are expected to believe its all unfolding in a fraction of the time that it would reasonably take to do this stuff. Do yourself a favour and go to Wikkipedia to read the plot details. At least you'll save yourself 2 hours","true":true}
