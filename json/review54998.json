Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was like sitting through a crappy Hannah Montana or that's so raven episode\\, it had crappy sitcom humor. The engineer\\, she was unnecessary and her acting screams Disney. It was forced and awkward. This ended the Star Wars saga for me\\, it ended with rogue one. Clearly Disney doesn't give a caca about character development. The only good thing we're scene shots and some battle scenes. Sunset did what all Star Wars fans feared George Lucas would do to the Star Wars saga\\, now I miss that crazy bastahd.who the f gave it 93%\\, this tells me they have no taste in films or Disney paid for those reviews.","true":true}
