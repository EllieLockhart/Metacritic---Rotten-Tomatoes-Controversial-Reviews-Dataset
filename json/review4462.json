Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Change is hard\\, and Star Wars traditionalists might take issue with the direction Rian Johnson has taken the series. However\\, the themes he's explored in TLJ pave the way for an even more exciting and open Star Wars universe than ever before--one that is aware of its legacy and past without being chained to it. The Last Jedi was by no means a perfect movie\\, and there were some definite hiccups along the way (especially the Canto Bight subplot)\\, but the movie's strengths more than make up for its weaknesses. I think that those who had an initial negative knee-jerk reaction to the movie might change their minds with time and a re-watch or two. I am glad Johnson took risks with TLJ instead of playing it so close and safe like J.J. Abrams did. With great risks come great rewards\\, and I think Johnson's gamble paid off here.","true":true}
