Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible.\\n1. Destroys any credibility of training for the Force. Now if you can use it\\, you are a Master by week 2 and can kill elite trained guards with a weapon you had never seen before 2 weeks ago.\\n2. Long boring chase through space? Seriously? They did a Space Chase scene while two completely unnecessary people go and succeed in doing nothing but getting more Rebels killed.\\n3. Destroyed Luke's character\\, and any nobility in the Jedi Order.\\n4. Disregards plot points and questions that the previous movie created.\\n5. BAD JOKES. The comedy is so off. \\n6. I'm done\\, this is just raising my blood pressure the more I think about it.\\n\\nPlease\\, just don't give Disney any money for this. Make them make Lucasfilm create better movies.","true":true}
