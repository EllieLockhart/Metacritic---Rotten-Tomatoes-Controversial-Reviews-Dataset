Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i didnt like the movie. it made me sad and upset. so many plot holes and strange chsracters. luke Skywalker was my hero growing up and to see him admit he gave into his darkness and the thought of killing his nephew ben was completely disheartening. luke was a man who found the truth of his father. no one believed darth vader could be turned to the lightside.. yoda\\, obiwan\\, even leia couldn't see Vader becoming \\\"good\\\" yet luke persist. and brought his father back.\\n\\nthen to see that same man luke\\, glimps into ben solo\\, see potential darkness and gleem to murder his nephew didnt make sense to me. \\nthen Luke left a map to find him when the galaxy needs him only for rey to find him then luke say i came here to die. all a mess","true":true}
