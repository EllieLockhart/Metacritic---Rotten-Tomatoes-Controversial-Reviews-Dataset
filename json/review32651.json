Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\\" is less derivative than \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" and much deeper than \\\"Rogue One.\\\" Unfortunately\\, most of the audiences have been giving lackluster reviews from this one. I guess it's all because of its running length and how most of its plot elements don't seem to click on them. But let me go over with the last two Star Wars movies. I thought \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" was an exciting film from start to finish\\, it's just I couldn't get over how familiar the film was going.  With \\\"Rogue One\\,\\\" I've found disliking the film\\, until the third act. Luckily\\, when I saw it again\\, it was much better than my first viewing. As with \\\"The Last Jedi\\,\\\" this one manages to be much deeper and exciting than I could ever imagine. It's not me saying that is perfect. It's very obvious to see that it was going back to elements of \\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\" and there's also a scene that's much closer to \\\"Return of the Jedi.\\\" Plus\\, there are some scenes in the film that I find a little tedious\\, (such as some of our heroes are stuck in space and fighting off the First Order). Still\\, I did find myself engaged with \\\"The Last Jedi.\\\" I think writer-director Rian Johnson\\, (who previously directed \\\"Brick\\\" and \\\"Looper\\\")\\, has a mind of its own of where he was telling this story. The characters\\, (such as Rey and Finn)\\, are more pleasing and enjoyable than ever. And I was not bored with any of its action sequences\\, especially its final battle. I may consider \\\"Blade Runner 2049\\\" as the best science fiction film of this year\\, but there's no reason for this should be forgotten.","true":true}
