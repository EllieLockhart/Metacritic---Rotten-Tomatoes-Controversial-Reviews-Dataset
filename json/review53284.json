Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Complete garbage! Again more poorly written characters that feel forced not flowing like they should be. Everything written for Luke in this movie was awful! We waited for the return of Luke since episode vii and are given a character that resembles nothing of the original Luke. Luke doesn't even train Rey which is the point of this movie. I mean why would he anyway because she is a Mary Sue and will have everything mastered already. The whole casino city scene is a pointless waste of time. The alliance is dying and needs help badly but let's stop and save these animals because who cares if our friends and the galaxy dies. Luke shows almost no remorse finding out about Han's death. Luke's death would have been cool had he not projected his image to the battle and actually been there. Kylo still wanting to rule the galaxy after fighting along side Rey was just like why? Kylo couldn't bring himself to kill his mom in the middle of the movie but at the end just let all of it be destroyed? And WTF was the surprise love with Finn and Rose? There is absolutely no build up for it. Just you have to accept this now. More forced stuff that makes no sense with this new trilogy. After this movie I won't be seeing any more in the theaters.","true":true}
