Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie\\, and it is probably my favorite SW film. While it is not perfect\\, it still maintains that SW feel. Don't be swayed by all the negative comments\\, see it for yourself. This film is different while it still does the Empire & Return of the Jedi storylines like Attack of the Clones but better. Can't wait for episode 9! Loved this movie so much\\, the critic's were right!","true":true}
