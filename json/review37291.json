Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The plot had so many holes\\, there were shoe-horned characters that took up much too much screen time\\, and no character development. Rey did what she wanted and ended up on top\\, because she knew more than the chosen one... The actors did what they could with the material they were given\\, but whoever rewrote Luke obviously had no idea who they were writing about. Visually was fantastic\\, substance in story was lacking. Also the military acumen of the rebel leaders leaves me wondering who put them in charge.","true":true}
