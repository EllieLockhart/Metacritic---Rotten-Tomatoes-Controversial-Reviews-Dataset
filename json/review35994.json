Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi pulled off combining the spirit of the old Star Wars with the freshness and innovation needed for a new century. I was on the edge of my seat\\, laughing and crying and being completely enchanted. Especially about General Leia and Admiral Holdo -- I never thought I would encounter a Star Wars character that I could identify with as much as I did with them. The rest of the cast was flawless\\, and the visuals as amazing as that first look at two suns setting a long time ago\\, in the movie that started this.","true":true}
