Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Much the same way Empire Strikes Back was a character play that took a deep dive into all of the original characters and their relationships with one another\\, so too is The Last Jedi\\, which takes us on Rey's journey of self discovery.  I thought the pace was good\\, and the action sequences were quite satisfying.  I liked how conflicted Luke was\\, thought the cameo appearance of Yoda was appropriate and well written\\, and overall thought this movie was a great \\\"passing of the torch\\\"...  Looking forward to the next one!","true":true}
