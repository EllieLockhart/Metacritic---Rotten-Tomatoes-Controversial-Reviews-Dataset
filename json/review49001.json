Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars film yet and one of the worst films I've seen period. Terrible\\, unimaginative plot\\, woeful use of existing and new characters and some real bizarre moments (Luke randomly milking some random alien teat and drinking the milk with a strange expression on his face??). It almost feels intentionally bad except I can't figure out their motive in doing so. Star Wars is over.","true":true}
