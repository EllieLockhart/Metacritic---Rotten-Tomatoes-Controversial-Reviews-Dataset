Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I rrally enjoyed TFA. Awesome visuals and music. One wild ride that feels like it pushes boundaries for the sake of it. Perhaps I am too old to enjoy the humor and too cynical to appreciate the story. I saw things I liked but the timing and execution seems out of place\\, it was hard to connect with this movie. Perhaps my expectations were too high? I don't want a rehash of previously told stories\\, but I do want a story that feels natural in its progression. It's Star Wars so everyone is going to see it\\, but how you will feel afterward is anyone's guess.\\nI wish I liked it more\\, but I am glad some are getting enjoyment from it.","true":true}
