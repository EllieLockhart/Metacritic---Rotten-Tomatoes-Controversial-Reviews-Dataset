Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning but with a script that is worse than full of holes--it actively disintegrates 40 years of character development and universe building. Sad to see Johnson do this to an iconic part of modern mythology. I wish someone during preproduction had the nerve to say that the emperor had no clothes and the script needed some serious outside help.","true":true}
