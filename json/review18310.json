Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought they were going to reinvent this story\\, instead they are keeping the same problems\\, just changing who's fighting now. This movie was so long for no payoff. Rey's background story is horrible and just lazy writing. There was nothing special about this movie. And they stole from The Empire Strikes back and Return of the Jedi.","true":true}
