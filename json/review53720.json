Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Gets 2.5 stars for the amazing cinematography and because Carrie Fisher turned in a great performance while on screen. Other than that...ruined Luke\\, his death was underwhelming and out of nowhere. Rey\\, love her but zero character development and still strong for no reason. Poe is actually good in this movie. Finn is no longer interesting as a stormtrooper turned good\\, he's just a joke. 3PO was good but needs more screen time. R2 has been forgotten by this trilogy and it's a crime. Kylo saying he didn't hate his father in this movie is ridiculous\\, of course he did. Snoke....don't get me started","true":true}
