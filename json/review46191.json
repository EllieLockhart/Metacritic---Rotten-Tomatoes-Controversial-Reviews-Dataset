{"101487":193167,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-22","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Walking out of The Last Jedi\\, sometime past midnight\\, I had a moment of clarity. I was done with Star Wars. The emotional investment I'd made\\, kept making\\, through horrific prequels and then through better\\, though blander recent Star Wars\\, had been extinguished.\\n\\nThe enduring hope each new film would live up to the sense of promise of the original two; the desire to see beloved characters done justice in their pasts and futures; to see new characters attain those same heights; a longing for a sense of awe\\, so long missing from the franchise: all this\\, crushed\\, under the heel of the Empire.\\nFirst\\, the movie itself. As all the great coaches say\\, it was one of two halves. One half was excellent. The Kylo Ren - Luke Skywalker - Rey storyline was well acted and written\\, had me on the edge of my seat. Adam Driver showed again why he is the best actor in the entire Star Wars franchise. \\nRen is the moral centre of The Last Jedi. By this I mean\\, he has genuine moral choices. His character has depth\\, ambiguities\\, conflicts. He is the only main character this can be said of (except Luke Skywalker\\, now relegated to minor character\\, who gives the best performance of this career to convey his own demons\\, his errors). Ren and Rey have excellent chemistry\\, and their confrontation of Snoke in his throne room was one for the ages.\\n\\nWhich is to say: half the film was as good as Empire Strikes Back.\\n\\nThe other half was abysmal. A cringeworthy\\, illogical\\, embarrassing b-plot completely wasteful of the talents of John Boyega\\, whose character Finn has apparently been relegated to the function of comic relief for the series. I had hoped they would do something meaningful with Finn\\, one with the dark and complex back story of child-soldier for the Empire.\\n\\nBut no. Instead they managed to shoehorn him into a casino caper with heavy lashings of anti-capitalism and save-the-whales. Reader\\, as a committed socialist and vegetarian I can say - after watching the nihilistically stupid CGI-heavy exposition of these themes -  I wanted to put a T-bone on the barbie and vote for Trump's tax cuts.\\nThe Last Jedi even went so far as to have the exploited child-labour kiddies of the Phantom Menace\\, an issue handled without about as much deftness as George Lucas discussing white slavery.\\n\\nWhich is to say: half the movie was as bad as any of the prequels.\\n\\nSo\\, the movie is half-bad\\, half-good. This could be forgiven\\, right? This is not reason\\, it itself\\, to give up on Star Wars?\\n\\nNo. And these aren't the reasons. The reason is I've come to accept the bleeding obvious: the series\\, now and forever more\\, is dictated by the central planning committee of Disney Corporation. The Empire now runs the franchise.\\nWhen I watch the next film\\, I will inevitably ask myself: how much of the film is the director's\\, and how much it is Disney's? Recall\\, since taking over the helm\\, the Empire has fired four directors from three Star Wars projects\\, and ordered significant reshoots of Rogue One.\\nTo me it felt like half was the film Rian Johnson wanted to make\\, while the other half came straight from the marketing department. Indeed\\, I'm not sure I've ever seen such a craven addition to a film - any film - as the Porg. A creature that serves no narrative function whatever\\, that exists only to replicate itself in the outside world as a popular teddy bear to be sold to children as we indoctrinate them into the Star Wars universe.\\nThe series will never again surprise. It will never again take risks. It will never again change cinema. The reasons for this should be obvious: there is a formula\\, now\\, that generates a billion dollars per film\\, so why alter it?\\nExcept for art\\, originality\\, and a sense of wonder\\, there is no good reason whatever.\\n\\nWhich brings us to JJ Abrams*. He\\, perhaps\\, perfectly represents what Star Wars has become. He helmed the Force Awakens\\, produced Last Jedi\\, and will write and direct episode nine.\\nWhy? Well. JJ is an intelligent film maker who knows completely\\, down deep in his bones\\, what the company wants. He is the master of 'sigh of relief' cinema: he takes a franchise struggling under the weight of several bad movies (Star Trek\\, Star Wars)\\, and rejuvenates it by doing a perfectly adequate job. On first viewing\\, the long-suffering fan thinks they've seen something very good. But as the days pass\\, as the unremarkable focus-group-driven movie passes out of their long-term memory into oblivion\\, there is a realisation: shit. That wasn't very good. That wasn't really...anything.\\nJJ Abrams has been called the new Steven Spielberg\\, and certainly\\, he wears Spielberg's influence on his sleeve. But there's fundamental differences between the two: Spielberg changed cinema forever\\, Abrams wants to keep it exactly the same. Spielberg's genius created the blockbuster\\, Abram's cold calculation only ever tweaks the same formula\\, over and over.\\n\\nGeorge Lucas\\, on the other hand\\, was like Vader. When he started out\\, young and idealistic\\, he did some amazing things. As he got older\\, and the call of his own hubris became too strong\\, he turned to the dark side. We got Ewoks. Then Gungans. And Midichlorians. And: \\\"NOOOOOOOOOO!\\\" But even then\\, at his worst - and his worst was terrible - at least he was still capable of originality. Lucas\\, like Vader\\, and unlike the Empire\\, could be redeemed. Just stick him in his toy room in Skywalker Ranch\\, pew pew pew! And let someone else write and direct his intellectual property. You know\\, like they did with Empire Strikes Back.  \\nNo more. I've given up on Star Wars because my people\\, the Rebellion\\, are making independent movies like Moonlight\\, or Whiplash\\, or The Rover\\, or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\, or Memento\\, or Animal Kingdom. At the bigger end of the scale\\, they're taking risks with movies like Blade Runner 2049.\\n\\nThere will be no more risks taken with Star Wars. There's just the brand and its components\\, rearranged by filmmaking algorithm\\, once per year\\, forever. Kinda takes the magic out of it all.\\n\\nAs some bloke at Variety said: \\\"Forty years later\\, we're still talking about 'Star Wars' and 'The Empire Strikes back'. Decades from now\\, are will still going to be talking about \\\"The Last Jedi\\\"?\\n\\nFuck no\\, mate\\, fuck no.","true":true}
