Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So much pressure and forcing the transfer of the force to new actors making it disingenuous and quite frankly sad. You can\u2019t recreate the magic without first believing it. Political correctness run amuck. ","true":true}
