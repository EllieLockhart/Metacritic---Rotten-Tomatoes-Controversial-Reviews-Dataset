Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Entretiene si\\, pero es tonta\\, llena de acci\u00f3n m\u00e1s que de personas e ideas ... sin historias\\, ni tramas profundas  o secretos... es como si starwars se mezclara con guardianes de la galaxia. \\nGracias Disney La pr\u00f3xima la veo On line","true":false}
