Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A 7 year old that became a star wars fan in 1977 to a 46 year old wondering if everything star wars influenced me with was a facade. Things need to change with time understandably but respect the heroes that created this great ambition fans hold onto. Feels like everything I loved about star wars got thrown over Disney's shoulder. I will still always feel lucky enough to have witnessed episodes 4\\, 5 and 6 in my influencing part of my life.","true":true}
