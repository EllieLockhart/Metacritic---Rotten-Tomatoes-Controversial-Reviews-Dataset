Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Utter garbage. I wonder how much disney pays these critics and fake people who \\\"loved\\\" it. The movie is laughable\\, i didn't know what was worse\\, the plot or the surprised awful awkward romance between Finn and Rose\\, like where the hell did that come from? Luke Skywalker turned to a miserabke bitchy character who was absolutely USELESS! Snoke was nothing but a filler\\, Kylo Ren is just man child and will never be as intimidating and scary as Darth Vader. Oh and no one cares about Rey because Luke never actually got to train her and that she has absolutely no connection to the skywalker family.","true":true}
