Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many plot holes it's unbelievable! How Luke Skywalker was handled was ridiculous. How meaningless Snoke and Captain Phasma were. Rose falling in love within 13 hours...I could go on!! Oh god and the bloody Pointless Finn and Rose side quest...","true":true}
