It\u2019s great. The Story may not be as good as The Last of Us but the gameplay feels really smooth and fast and good.

The side characters are better than in the first game\\, because they act and talk more realistic. Overall are the characters as good as in the last of us or even a little better. One thing that could make the story not as good is what it\u2019s about. It\u2019s a brutal story about revenge and not love and then it\u2019s harder to make it a beautiful story. But as far as I know\\, Naughty Dog wants us to question what Ellie and Joel did. And the game still has beautiful moments. I think the hate comes from many people that didn\u2019t want a second game\\, but in my opinion\\, a continuation was needed. Overall I can say that The Last of Us had a better story\\, but the second part has better gameplay and the best graphics and animations I\u2019ve ever seen. I never noticed something i didn\u2019t like in part 2. It\u2019s on a good way to become my favorite game of all time...And btw\\, this is my first ever review on metacritic\\, so I\u2019m sorry if it\u2019s a little confusing or so...\u2026 Expand","true":true}
