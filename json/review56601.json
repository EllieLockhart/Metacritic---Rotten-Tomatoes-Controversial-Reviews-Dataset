Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is heartbreaking as a dedicated Star Wars fan. I went into this movie ecstatic about the future of Rey\\, Poe\\, Finn\\, Kylo\\, Luke and Snoke. The Last Jedi instead of leveraging the amazing character development from the original trilogy and the potential to learn more about our new heroes decides to tarnish the legacy of Luke Skywalker and bank the whole tension of the movie on whether the Resistance are going to run out of gas or not..... The fate of the entire resistance is dwindled down to \\\"Oh geez we're really getting low on gas here huh....\\\"\\n\\nLuke Skywalker who's entire character revolves around him caring about his family and friends so much he's willing to take great risks to go and save them spends his time throwing a pity party on an island\\, not caring that his sister is about to die and that his nephew murdered his best friend. Luke Skywalker who believed so strongly that Darth Vader could be redeemed despite his atrocities on the galaxy that he refused to fight him in the Emperor's throne room thinks about murdering Ben Solo because he's afraid of the darkness he harbors within him. Luke Skywalker's character is completely assassinated in The Last Jedi.\\n\\nRey becomes a Jedi Master after 3 lessons. 3 lessons. She is never taught how to use a light saber. She literally receives no light saber training from Luke and has zero trouble dispatching Snoke's Imperial guard which one can infer is the most elite\\, well trained guard in the universe. Rey can also use the force to move a mountain of boulders despite never being trained by Luke on how to use the force. Rey doesn't even understand what the force is and then after 3 lessons\\, none of which involve using the force to move objects or learn to use a light saber\\, she can now move essentially mountains. \\n\\nFinn and side kick's plot is literally pointless. They go on a mission to find an imperial codebreaker. Through a series of nonsensical events complete their mission only to find out it was never needed and end up getting more Resistance members killed.\\n\\nLeia uses the force\\, despite never having shown more than just mild force sensitivity\\, to float through space like Mary Poppins in maybe the most ridiculous scene I've ever witnessed in my life. \\n\\nSnoke\\, the most mysterious\\, intriguing supreme leader pulling all the strings is killed without a single explanation to how he came to rule the First Order\\, who is\\, how he became such a powerful force user? Just dead.\\n\\nThe more I reflect on The Last Jedi the more and more disappointed I become knowing this is the future of the Star Wars universe.","true":true}
