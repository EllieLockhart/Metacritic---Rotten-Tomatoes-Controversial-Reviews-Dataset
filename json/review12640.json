Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can understand why people didn\u2019t enjoy the movie. There were some parts that didn\u2019t fit and the twist at the end wasn\u2019t what I had expected. But at the end of the day it\u2019s just a movie and I was entertained.","true":true}
