Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great movie\\, a little less on the comedy. It definitely gives a twist \\, I did have to go twice to really understand it. I was one of those fanboys that thought it would go a different way. Nice twist to throw everyone off..","true":true}
