Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was prepared to be disappointed with this movie. I didn't love TFA\\, it was alright- just not great\\, so i had a pretty low bar going into TLJ (Hopinig to be pleasantly surprised). TLJ was visually impressive but that's all I can give it. The plot was weak\\, the characters= weak. The script was bad\\, I'm not sure if the writer just improvised on the spot or what. There seemed to be a lot of forced political issues that I didn't understand. We get it\\, girl power hooray! I don't care what gender or race you cast\\, just give me some character development\\, some decent lines and acting\\, maybe a basic plot or even a bit of action would have been nice. Honestly the movie was not the worst movie I've ever seen\\, it wasn't as bad as say-World of Warcraft in terms of scripting but it was a chore watching it. I cringed a lot.","true":true}
