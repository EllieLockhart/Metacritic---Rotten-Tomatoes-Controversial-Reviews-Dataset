Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you want to watch.....\\nJedi face time\\nJedi astral projection \\nJedi superman\/Mary poppins \\nslapstick comedy \\nLoads of ham acting\\nLoads of terrible acting\\nThat moody emo teenager throwing tantrums \\nSome one who's mastered way more of the Jedi religion than it took luke over 3 films.\\nLoads of pointless characters\/ships\/vehicles  for their merchandising bank balance\\nThen please enjoy.\\n\\nAll that money and they couldn't make  a better film than Spaceballs and that's good! I was expecting a CGI'd Leslie Nielsen to stick his head round the corner at some point and recite parts from \\\"Airplane \\\"\\n\\nShockingly bad film \\, I've given up expecting anything good to ever come from Disney's fingertips with Star Wars \\n\\nThis film is the Emperor's New Clothes","true":true}
