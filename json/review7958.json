Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Extremely disappointing. Seems like the writing was meant to cast many story elements from TFA to the wind and lay the framework down for a new\\, and now less interesting\\, story. I left the theater underwhelmed and it has slowly turned into anger and disappointment. I can\u2019t even feel excited about the next episode. ","true":true}
