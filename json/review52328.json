Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A good movie. Was a little too risky with its plot\\, which didn't make sense in essence\\, but the action scenes were good. I liked the introduction of the character Rose. As for Luke Skywalker\\, we do see another\\, unexpected side of him - a potentially disagreeable side - but I do expect him to come back as a mentor for Rey (who is still a Mary Sue\\, but I find it interesting that she comes from a \\\"Nobody\\\".) I think it was an okay movie. Better than TFA as a whole in my opinion. The Leia scene was ridiculous\\, but maybe they're trying to define the force and what it can do?? It's hard to say. I was disappointed by this installment\\, but the middle of a triology normally moves slowly\\, and I was pleasently surprised in that aspect.","true":true}
