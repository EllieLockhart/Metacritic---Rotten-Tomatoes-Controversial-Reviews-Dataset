Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The scenes between Kylo and Rey are in my opinion the best in the movie. They are honestly great scenes. Adam driver's  Kylo is what really holds this movie up for me. Luke is also great\\, would of been better with longer scenes. I also enjoyed the interactions between the Code Breaker and Fin ( I hope it adds color to bad\/good guy views); though Rose often makes me want to cringe ( I like Jar Jar more than her). I also want to know how Fin learned to fly after say multiple times he didn't know how in TFA. I found all other characters average at best\\, Hopefully Episode 9 is better.\\n\\ntl;dr It's Okay.","true":true}
