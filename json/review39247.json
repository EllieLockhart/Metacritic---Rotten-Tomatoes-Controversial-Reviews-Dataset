Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this film had a joke of a plot direction\\, with all the side story's it just got annoying. Acting in this film was even worse than the plot line\\, with all the actors only using facial reactions to express emotions\\, half the time I was trying to stop myself from laughing at this joke of a film.","true":true}
