Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rubbish...destroying the saga one film at a time. Do yourself a favor and buy the first 3 (unaltered if possible) and forget the rest. I'm done. They won't trick me into paying to see another film in the theaters. Thanks Disney\\, for finally putting a stake in the heart of my childhood.","true":true}
