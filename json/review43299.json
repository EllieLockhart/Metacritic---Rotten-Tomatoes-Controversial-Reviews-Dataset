Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a fun\\, solid story\\, and I'm really glad I caught it in the movieplex.\\n\\nI think the new cast of characters are fun\\, have great potential for development\\, and I'm looking forward to seeing how they carry the storyline on from the old guard.\\n\\nWere there weak spots?  Of course.  There have been in every Star Wars story.  But overall\\, this is a great movie--don't let the haters convince you otherwise.","true":true}
