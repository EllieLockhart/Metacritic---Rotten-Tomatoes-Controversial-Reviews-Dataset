Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i love it\\, the story is new and very interesting\\,beacuse the darknes road of opccion of the caracters\\, the best\\, the caracter\u00b4s interaction\\, and the neutral point the fight the light and force vs the darknes","true":true}
