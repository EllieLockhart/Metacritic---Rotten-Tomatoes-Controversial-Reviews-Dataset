ND\\, you created a trans character in a massive AAA title... but you have done nothing but make people hate and resent her\\, doing great disservice to the trans community. You could have redeemed this character... but you've only stereotyped a large swath of the LBGTQ+ community. This character could have been a great ambassador to gamers all around... but you've fostered nothing but anger towards queer people by being pointlessly  provocative.Seriously... shame on you\\, ND.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
