Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All you naysayers\\, if it wasn\u2019t for Disney\\, we would have no new Star Wars! It had some great moments. I have been a fan all my life\\, remember it\u2019s only a movie. ","true":true}
