Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The story doesn't make alot of sense. Whats wrong with having everything connected? Ostensibly you are trying to break the cycle and go out in to new territory. Having Skywalker hanging out on a planet in hiding a la Yoda isn't new. If skywalker is apathetic then do that. But this feels like in a rush to go to the next generation. Less than satsified.","true":true}
