Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Without a doubt\\, this is the worst movie in the Star Wars saga.  An excess of humor without grace\\, appalling performances\\, removing that of Mark Hamill.  The script is the one who has the most fault\\, it is long and sometimes boring I do not find any emotion in the film\\, except for 2 moments that I will later count in spoilers.  The only salvageable thing is the bso\\, which is a wonder of John Williams\\, but even so it is also one of the weakest in the series.  I have seen it three times and it does not completely convince me.","true":true}
