Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Decent movie\\, but shows little respect for Star Wars as a whole. Introduces serious plot holes and question marks in the earlier films. Is Poe really on a whole different level than Anakin and Luke as a pilot? Why couldn't Obi Wan intervene in the fight against Vader? If Leia can do what she did\\, then surely Mace Windu is still alive\\, right? I could go on for days. \\n\\nMark Hamill was amazing\\, though.","true":true}
