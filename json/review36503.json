Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie could have been so much better\\, but the desire to get rid of the past dominated the film. The casino scene was boring as watching the credits roll. Mary Poppins\\, wow\\, just wow. Unnecessary. Plot holes everywhere. Wasted characters. It felt like the directors couldn't agree on a vision from the seventh to eighth movie. Between the filler and plot holes\\, I'd avoid.","true":true}
