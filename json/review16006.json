Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Imagine if someone had set out to deliberately derail the Star Wars franchise and you come close to understanding how poor TLJ really is. Ignoring all the history of the first trilogy\\, the logic and physics of the universe and making a film that is boring\\, jumbled that staggers from unfunny attempts at comedy to totally misjudged dialogue and sub-plots. Watch Force Awakens again instead and imagine the film that should have come next\\, because this isn't it.","true":true}
