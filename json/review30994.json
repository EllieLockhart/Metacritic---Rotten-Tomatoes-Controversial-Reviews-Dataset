Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So good. So very\\, very good. There's an excellent message about letting go of the past that some of these other reviewers seem to take umbridge at. :P\\nAnd SO good to see such diversity in a Star Wars film!!","true":true}
