Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was awful - don't believe the critics. I was bored and several times wanted to leave the cinema. It's not just a bad SW movie\\, but a bad stand alone movie. Has me questioning whether I saw the same film that all those reviewers giving this 4 or 5 stars saw?!","true":true}
