Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It ruins Luke character and makes Rey an even more powerful Mary Sue for no reason. Finn \\, the most interesting character of this trilogy is put with Rose just to justify her\\, and all they do in this movie is useless (they ocupy more than half of the movie) ...Why Rey have to find Luke to train her if Leia is awesome with the force without explanation? . It may work as a non-starwars movie. But ignoring Star wars Legacy make this film really bad","true":true}
