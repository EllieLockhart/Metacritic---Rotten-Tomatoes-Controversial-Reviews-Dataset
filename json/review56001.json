Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Seeing the all objections to this film is hilarious. Complaints about the number of women\\, about the diverse cast\\, about how the film didn't do what you expected it to (cry more)\\, about how it subverted what the Force means.\\n\\nAn of course\\, the always popular 'all GENUINE fans' comment\\, as if by liking the film\\, I can't be a genuine fan and my opinion can be dismissed. So only people who agree with you count\\, huh? I'll just go back in time to 8 year old me playing with original action figures and watching the original trilogy on VHS and tell him he isn't a real fan...\\n\\nI liked this film. It was fun. It had fun moments\\, set in a particular dark story about a fascist regime's military takeover.  It was subversive and everyone who spend the last 2 years making fan fiction will be bitterly disappointed. They thought themselves so clever with all of the little connections they believed they'd found. Now VIII hasn't gone the way they expected\\, so it must be that Disney are wrong\\, that the film is bad. So childish.\\n\\nI liked this film. So did many other people. If you liked it\\, great! If you didn't\\, then that is fine too. That is your opinion. But don't be so childish as to somehow claim is shouldn't be 'canon'. Grow up.","true":true}
