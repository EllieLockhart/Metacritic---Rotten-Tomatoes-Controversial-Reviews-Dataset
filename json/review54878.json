Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's an unpopular opinion\\, but it's changes and differentness are what makes the movie so good. The plot has significant issues and leaves too many unanswered questions that are likely never to be answered. But the film is beautifully shot\\, and full of exciting spectacle all framed within the intimacy and danger of a submarine action film. It's use of the Force and visuals are wonderfully weird. I went to TLJ to have a good time and it delivered that and left me thinking about all the gorgeous things that can be done with Star Wars in the future when we are done mining what we can out of it's past.","true":true}
