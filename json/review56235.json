Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi is a breath of fresh air in the Star Wars Saga. As somebody who has seen all the movies a dozen times\\, read hundreds of books\\, comics\\, etc. I am glad that Rian Johnson took this film in a new direction. The Cinematography in this film is stunning and the movie is extremely beautiful. Luke is taken in a new direction which is shocking yet interesting and despite what others may say doesn't ruin his character\\, simply makes him a deeper character who has flaws. My only issues with the film is many of the scenes with Finn and Rose\\, the scenes mostly go no where and instead mostly exist to further teach Poe a lesson. Oscar Issac\\, Mark Hamill\\, Carrie Fisher\\, and Adam Driver are all on the top of there game is this movie. Driver especially brings a serious depth and level of interest to his character. The Last Jedi is easily within my Top 10 movies of the year and in my top 3 star wars movies.","true":true}
