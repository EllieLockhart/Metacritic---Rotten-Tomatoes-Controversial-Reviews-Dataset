Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bland characters and immersion breaking logic problems throughout. Why bother making a massive dreadnought if it can be destroyed by 1 bomber?..why bother making a massive capital ship if it can be destroyed by a ship engaging it's light speed engines and ramming it?..why did the rebels not do this to the death star if it was possible?. Why if Luke did not want to be found...DID HE LEAVE A MAP DETAILING HOW TO FIND HIM?; this movie manages to be not only be nonsense but actually undermines the rest of the series.","true":true}
