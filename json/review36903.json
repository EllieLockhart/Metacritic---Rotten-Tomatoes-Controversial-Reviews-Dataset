Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was extensively long\\, it was almost like a remake of \\\"The Return of The Jedi\\\" with jokes scattered along the film\\, almost making fun of the formula. The story progressed quite a bit and I would love to see this film again.","true":true}
