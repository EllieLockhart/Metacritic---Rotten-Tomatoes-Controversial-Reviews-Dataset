Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible. Major Plot holes everywhere. Rian Johnson clearly doesn't know how space works. Disjoined plots\\, no observance to established lore\\, plots\\, or established ways the force works. Feels like the Avengers in Space. Literally no character development because Rey is a Mary Sue that can do things with ease that other Jedi like Yoda have to strain to do\\, with no training whatsoever. And Luke\\, fuck Rian Johnson for taking the biggest inspiration from my childhood and shitting on it. That wasn't Luke.","true":true}
