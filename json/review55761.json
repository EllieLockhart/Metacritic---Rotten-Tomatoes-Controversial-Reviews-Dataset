Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall Wow Wowiee Star Wars: The Last Jedi was amazing \\, awesome and emotional as well. I had a ton of fun watching this film!!! All the characters where good to great from the hero characters like Rey \\, Luke Skywalker \\, General Leia \\, Poe Dameron and Finn also Rose one of the new characters was great as well to the villains like Kylo Ren \\, Snoke \\, General Hux etc. Also the cinematography in this movie was amazing with all the scenes lit very well. The action was paced well some minor pacing issues but for me did not take me out of the film. The Sound Design as always what you expect with a Star Wars Film amazing also John Williams musical score for me at least is a lot better than The Force Awakens. My favorite characters in this movie is almost everyone but will have to go with Rey \\, Luke and Leia. Rian Johnson did an amazing job directing this film and got what he want from the actors \\, crew etc. Can't say much more without going into Spoilers so all I will say go see this movie you will enjoy it and for me this is one of the best Star Wars Films ever. Overall I give   Star Wars: The Last Jedi a forceful outstanding 9.7\/10 a great movie and great Star Wars film and I can't wait to revisit this movie when it comes out on Blu-Ray Disc in early 2018.  There is a ton to process Star Wars fans. May The Force Be With You Always !!!","true":true}
