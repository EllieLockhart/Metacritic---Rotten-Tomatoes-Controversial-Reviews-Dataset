Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"3.5\/5.  While The Last Jedi is a good movie\\, it suffers from several sever flaws.  It's much too long\\, it has too many new characters that all feel underdeveloped\\, and one of the major storylines feels completely unnecessary.  However\\, what The Last Jedi gets right\\, it really gets right.  Mark Hamil\\, Daisy Ridley\\, and Adam Driver are all phenomenal and make the movie worth seeing.  But with all of the hype surrounding this film\\, I can't help but feel a bit disappointed.","true":true}
