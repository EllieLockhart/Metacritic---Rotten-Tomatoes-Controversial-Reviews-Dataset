Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was all I was expecting and more\\, it was amazing don't know how other people didn't like it\\, the one down side is when ever Mark (Luke) spoke I just heard the joker","true":true}
