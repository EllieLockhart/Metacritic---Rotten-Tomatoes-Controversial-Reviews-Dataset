Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In the beginning scroll of the next movie they could have told me three things that happened in The Last Jedi and I could have skipped the 2 1\/2 hours that was Star Wars VII and been just fine. There were zero surprises. And it was so..... long.","true":true}
