Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some fans will hate this movie because it challenges the way we used to think about Star Wars. It\u2019s new and it\u2019s refreshing. People complain the plot was muddled and has holes\\, name a single Star Wars movie that hasn\u2019t had a few plot holes. This movie was great because it is original and unique. J J Abrams is a crowd pleaser. Rian Johnson is a filmmaker. However I do believe J.J. will make a perfect spectacle to conclude the series. ","true":true}
