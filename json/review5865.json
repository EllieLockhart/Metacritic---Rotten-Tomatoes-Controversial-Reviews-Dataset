Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing. An example of liberal Hollywood forcing their ideals on us. THEY know better how we should think and feel. This was not only a bad movie\\, but a hit job on characters\\, plots\\, and a universe we have loved since childhood. ","true":true}
