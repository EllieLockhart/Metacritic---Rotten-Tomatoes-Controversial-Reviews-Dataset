Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My biggest complaint is that it was very slow in the middle with an unnecessary side plot\\, the tone was all over the place and the comedy was forced. The director took the momentum from the last film and threw it off a cliff like Luke did with the lightsaber. Adam Driver was the only one we cared about while the other characters are just vanilla. Could have done some epic things with the iconic characters from the past and instead just whiffed completely. This pains me to say\\, but this movie made me appreciate the prequels.","true":true}
