Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie contained enough beautiful shots and witty bits of humor to earn a second star\\, but all things considered this was the most bitterly disappointing movie I have ever watched.\\n\\nIt's far from the worst movie I have ever seen\\, but it is certainly the most disappointing.  The Last Jedi is everything I feared the sequel trilogy would become and worse.  I don't have time to pick apart every glaring flaw\\, so I will just say that this simply wasn't a Star Wars movie.  It was such a depressing let down that it literally made me want to cry.","true":true}
