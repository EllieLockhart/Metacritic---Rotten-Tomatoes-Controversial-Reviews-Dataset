Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was alright. I felt during the whole movie something was missing. I was waiting for something really exciting to happen\\, and there were very few exciting parts.  Humor felt forced in the film.  I enjoyed the development of the new characters.  I was not satisfied with what they did or portrayed Luke Skywalker.  Rey was absolutely boring during the film and felt she was not challenged at all and not worthy of being the future of the jedi films. I really think the director just missed it on this one\\, and the story itself seemed to go no where.","true":true}
