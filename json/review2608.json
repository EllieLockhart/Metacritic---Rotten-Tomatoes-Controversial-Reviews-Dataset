Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awesome movie. Amazing effects great characters\\, great costumes\\, great production design\\, lots of tension in the story lightly salted with comedy at the perfect times. A real feel good movie. Takes me back to seeing the first series the first time. This and the last star wars are two of the best in the series.","true":true}
