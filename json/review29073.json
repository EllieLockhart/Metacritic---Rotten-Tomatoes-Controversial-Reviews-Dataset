Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really looked forward to this movie\\, but ended up wanting to leave 40 minutes into watching it. Protagonists and villains (including those I was fond of in the previous films) were incredibly annoying and made uncharacteristic decisions that had completely avoidable consequences. Every minute there was another cringeworthy scene that was trying to be heartfelt. I literally had difficulty remaining seated due to how drawn out\\, boring\\, and stupid this movie was. I have watched every single Star Wars and animated Star Wars film and have played almost all of the games\\, so I am a massive fan of this franchise. That being said\\, because of this movie I will never watch another Star Wars film made by Disney again.","true":true}
