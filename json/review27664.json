Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Parts of the movie were shit! Other parts were gold. I'm a big fan of rei and all the characters but some scene's sucked so much leah all of a sudden is a Jedi and the center of the hope so stupid. Casino scene was stupid ad well. Also Fin was about to die in the blaze of glory and some useless girl knocked him off. Not ebough light saber battles.","true":true}
