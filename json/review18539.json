Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is with great sadness that I give \\\"Star Wars:  The Last Jedi\\\" 1 1\/2 stars.  One of the things anticipated with Rian Johnson having written and directed this movie\\, is an independent film edge.  There was none.  The movie has broad\\, silly humor\\, that one might find in kids' Disney Channel series.  \\n\\nThere are two major 'red herrings' in this movie\\, one that consumes much of the running time\\, and the other involving a major character\\, about whom there was much speculation on the topic after \\\"The Force Awakens.\\\"  This movie is 2 1\/2 hours long\\, and it does not need to be\\, with extraneous storylines.  \\n\\nThere is a tangential subplot\\, involving a character's backstory that was simply unnecessary.  In addition\\, there is a place visited that could've been given a grittiness\\, in the style of \\\"Blade Runner\\,\\\" but\\, instead looks like it could've been sliced right out of an animated Disney movie.  Silly and goofy characters abound.\\n\\nThere are great moments in \\\"The Last Jedi.\\\" However\\, those moments are far outweighed by the problems shared above.  One character shines throughout the movie\\, and that's Rey.  Daisy Ridley gives a fantastic performance. Unfortunately\\, there is no development to Adam Driver's Ben Solo\/Kylo Sen.\\n \\nSo\\, as someone who saw \\\"Star Wars:  The Last Jedi\\\" opening night\\, it is truly with great sadness that I give it such a poor rating and review.  And\\, it looks like JJ Abrams has a tall task ahead of him\\, to pick up where Johnson left off\\, with the last film in the trilogy.","true":true}
