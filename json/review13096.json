Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don\u2019t know what some of these fans are thinking when they submit these reviews but I\u2019ve been a diehard fan for as long as I can remember and The Last Jedi is seriously one of the best Star Wars I\u2019ve ever seen as well as adds new details to the universe. The directing is great the acting is great along with some of the coolest action scenes I\u2019ve seen in a Star Wars movie ","true":true}
