Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The story is a total mess\\, for starters. It's packed with narrative holes and leaden dialogue\\, and the whole enterprise is hopelessly trapped inside a tortuous series of incompatible timelines that stretch credibility well beyond anything that even setting the story in a galaxy far\\, far away can excuse.\\nThe film's tone is all over the place\\, too\\, switching horribly awkwardly between (usually painfully lame) humor\\, serious 'Force stuff' and lots of people dying without even trying to establish any sort of context for its changing moods.\\n\\nDull\\, messy scripts can sometimes be rescued by great direction. But sadly\\, despite his enjoyable efforts with Looper\\, writer\/director Rian Johnson consistently fluffs the job of filming his own words.\\n\\nTense scenes fail to build tension. Dramatic scenes deliver no drama. Emotionally charged scenes lack emotional charge. Fight scenes look horribly stilted and leaden. Jokes generally feel so labored or are delivered so abruptly that they feel more like a slap in the face than something that might actually make you laugh.\\n\\nI really can't think of a single important scene where you get any sense that Johnson understands how to use imagery to add power to the film's generally underwhelming events.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi's many filmmaking fails left me with almost nothing I could latch on to in order to become immersed in the action\\, leaving me desperate for the whole dull mess to come to an end at least an hour before it did. And once the criminally drab conclusion was finally reached\\, I couldn't help but find myself comparing The Last Jedi with Alien 3 in terms of its franchise-crushing awfulness.","true":true}
