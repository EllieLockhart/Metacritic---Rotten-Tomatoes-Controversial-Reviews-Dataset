Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wasn't completely sure what to think of The Last Jedi after my first viewing but after a couple of screenings I was totally sold. Luke's story in particular was very moving. Great film\\, great cast\\, great score. What's not to love?","true":true}
