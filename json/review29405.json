Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson did not disappoint. Johnson wrote and directed Star Wars The Last Jedi. Johnson's take on the characters was very interesting. he added more depth and range of both old and new characters. Your move J.J. Abrams. ","true":true}
