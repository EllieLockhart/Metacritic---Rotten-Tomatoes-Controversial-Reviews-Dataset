Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mr Johnson's awful treatment of the much-loved heroes of old can be described at mercenary at best\\, and treachery at worst. The way the director has trampled on all that is good that came before him\\, makes me wonder if he is even a Star Wars fan at all. \\n\\nGeorge Lucas\\, despite his much-maligned prequels\\, being the creator would have treated his heroes more dearly. He would have respected the lore and protected the world that was built through painstaking efforts. He would never have allowed a storyline where a mother is (almost) killed by her own son (who had already murdered his father in cold-blood)\\, and for the most compassionate of them all\\, to be betrayed by his own insecurities\/fears and eventually retreat into solitude. He would never have let his heroes' sacrifices and victories count for nothing and revert the world back to its dark ages again. It is a disdainful rejection of the symbols that these characters had stood for: kindness\\, chivalry\\, bravery and an unwavering belief of good in face of evil.\\n\\nMr Johnson's is a terrific director no doubt\\, but in my opinion in his and probably Disney's zeal to subvert everyone's expectations\\, overwhelm critics\\, and to prove themselves as edgier and cleverer than the rest\\, they have alas abandoned the fundamentals of good fantasy fiction. Tell a simple but nice story\\, create characters that people love\\, celebrate humankind's potential for good\\, and let audience lose themselves temporarily in an unforgettable world. The same can be found in all timeless classics such as LOTR. Star Wars was the same for me as a boy\\, but it is now irrevocably damaged by this unfortunate piece of short-sighted bravado.\\n\\nCall me a romanticist\\, but I believe that Star Wars at his core\\, was never about destiny or noble blood\\, as much as Mr Johnson riled against it. It was about a young boy\\, who despite coming from a unremarkable background and seemingly no potential for greatness\\, with his pure heart and loyalty for family and friends\\, will overcome all odds and ultimately be the one to triumph over evil and save the galaxy. And despite his immaturity\\, ignorance and childishness\\, through painful failures he will someday learn to control his negative emotions\\, grow wiser and stronger\\, and defeat what he could not defeat before. He becomes a Jedi - a human par-excellence and embodiment of goodness. That he is a Skywalker is much less relevant than any of that. Any true fan of Star Wars knows this\\, but sadly it seems Disney and co. do not\\, judging from the unrealistic powers and infallibility of its newest heroines.\\n\\nSo therefore as Disney achieves its ultimate goals\\, with money pouring in and critics' praise flowing freely\\, I on the other hand\\, as will many die-hard romantics such as myself\\, bid adieu to my beloved heroes\\, move on other stories and never look back. But I will always remember with fondness the exploits of Luke Han and Leia and the nights of my youth spent watching them\\, and share them with anyone who cares to listen.\\n\\nFrom a heartbroken Star Wars fan","true":true}
