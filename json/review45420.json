Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very blend and stupid story\\, gray visuals unappealing to look at\\,  confusing as hell plot\\, depressing atmosphere\\, plot holes all over the place\\, useless and unfleshed out characters giving minor uninteresting roles\\, how can you mess up a star wars movie like that. I watched revenge of the sith just after and boy it looks more alive than Last Jedi. Where is the soul of the Star Wars universe? where is the color?? Where is the soul???  Disney fix it up\\, it's bleeding from everywhere\\, you have a lot of patching up to do.","true":true}
