Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie wasn't just disrespectful to the franchise and its long time fans.  It was just flat out a bad movie.  JJ Abrams almost destroyed the franchise with the nonsensical The Force Awakens\\, but this one was even worse.  I try to stay away from theaters\\, but make exceptions for Star Wars and Star Trek.  I won't being going to the theaters anymore for Star Wars.  Disney has lot my trust and Rian Johnson seems like an egomaniac and bad director.  How could this movie have been green lit?\\n\\nAnd BTW folks\\, no this is not a bot and I am not hacking Rotten Tomatoes.  Maybe\\, just maybe\\, people are rating the movie this way because it was really bad and they don't like it.","true":true}
