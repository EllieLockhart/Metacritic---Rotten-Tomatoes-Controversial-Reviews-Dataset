Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Biggest flop in SW history. Horrible story telling\\, killed nearly all continuity and context. Poor decisions\\, bad writing and characters we are forced to care about... but still don't. They ruined all potential with the classic characters\\, opting for quick gimmicks and surprises over good character arcs. It's a pretty film\\, Disney production but\\, it pretty much ruins Star  Wars for me.","true":true}
