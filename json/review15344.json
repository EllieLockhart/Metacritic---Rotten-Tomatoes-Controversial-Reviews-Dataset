Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i'll leave it at 2 1\/2\\, just way to many what the hell moments. Far too many questions that still need answering and the thing with Rey's parents. UM YA\\, not buying it. What was the deal with Luke? Should of been a better ending than that. As for Snoke.....UM YA. As of right now\\, its fighting with the Clone Wars for the bottom of the barrel.","true":true}
