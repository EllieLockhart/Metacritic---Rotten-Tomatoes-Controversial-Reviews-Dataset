Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a steaming hot mess. The character of Luke Skywalker is completely incongruent with what we saw from the previous episodes and the latest treatment is completely disrespectful. \\n\\nThe Rose character feels like it was jammed in the story to score some cheap brownie points with Asian and female audiences and is not intergral to the main story. \\n\\nThere is so much more wrong with the movie but would require spoilers. There is a special place in hell for Rian Johnson for sabotaging this franchise. The downturn in the opening week figures speaks for itself and no amount of Disney promotion is going to mask to stink.","true":true}
