Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is nothing but a parody of a once great franchise. It laughed at itself while patronizing it's audience with constant explanations of what we all just saw happen. This self plagiarizing movie lost on almost every level. The movies only accomplishment was to prove once again that Hollywood knows they can polish a turd with loud explosions\\, vast special effects shots and state of the art practical effects\\, slap a logo on it and it will sell.","true":true}
