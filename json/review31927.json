Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoiler free review....I will fully admit I had certain things I wanted to see and rian johnson delivered almost none of them in this movie. It's a nice film but Disney just butchered any rules of that Star Wars universe and rian Johnson was more interested in plot twists than any sort of logical story progression. I'm not sure how but it was the longest Star Wars movie that left the most questions about how people wound up where they are at in this movie. I feel very blah about this movie.","true":true}
