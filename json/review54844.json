Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is sad to say this but people are right when they say this is the worst star wars films ever. I liked the prequels and admire George Lucas as the creator of this wonderful world that has spawn so many stories: books\\, toys\\, movies\\, tv series\\, etc... This movie being is not one of those stories\\, Rian Jhonson the director\\, a nobody in the film industry\\, destroyed with his script a legacy of over 40 years. I'm not sure why Disney could let this story pass as an episode of the Star Wars saga\\, if they want to start something new\\, create a new series with a different name and nobody would mind. But this guy and disney\\, sistematically destroyed everything that star wars represented since 1977 and replaced the values of sacrifice\\, determination\\, discipline\\, hard work for anti-values like luck\\, chance\\, magic. Rey is a character that hasn't work for anything she has\\, uses the force better than Luke Skywalker\\, even beat him in a duel with sticks. Luke is nothing but the hero we all knew since episode iv\\, he is now a bitter selfish coward that doesnt wanna help anybody when he knows he is the only jedi alive\\, something that would never have happened on George Lucas watch. The main plot is an slow chase between the empire and the rebels because they are running out of fuel\\, bombs in space that \\\"fall\\\"\\, the writer is an ignorant of space physics\\, (again why disney let this past is beyond me). There are no development of the story whatsoever\\, this is the second installment of the trilogy and after the movie ends we are in a point much far behind than at the beginning of the movie\\, all the TFA questions are left unanswered here\\, and even worse\\, most of them are irrelevant now\\, but no new questions were created. The recommendation is not to watch this film\\, wait for the third movie and it its good\\, watch this and then the other\\, so at least the anger you felt with this thing (that is not a movie by any standard) will be a matter of hours and not years like the people who watched this would fill till we forget about it all \\, including the next movies\\, or the next episode arrives and is good (I doubt it\\, since this is JJ Abrams and K. Kennedy). So again don't watch this\\, keep the first six episodes in your memory and forget about Disney Star Wars.","true":true}
