Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw the movie opening night and loved the new direction they are taking Star Wars in. For the same reasons many fans seem to have hated it\\, I loved it. It challenged itself\\, the mythos\\, and was a much needed complete departure from what I felt would have been a rehashing of the original trilogy.","true":true}
