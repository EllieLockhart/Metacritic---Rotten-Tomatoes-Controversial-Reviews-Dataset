Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Why did Rey have all those visions?\\n\\nIf Smoke is so powerful why was he killed so easily and by such a run-of-the-mill parlor trick deception?\\n\\nThe \\\"new\\\" heroes only fail at each quest and survive mostly by luck. \\n\\nLuke was able to conquer the darkness in himself and face the emperor and Vader... Even helped Vader to the light side again but decides Kylo isn't able to be saved and goes to kill him in his sleep... Really?\\n\\nThe movie would have you believe Luke made a snap judgement but he went to where his nephew slept and brought a weapon. That's forethought in any book.  \\n\\nTerrible plot about a slow 2 hour 20 minute chase; in movie time... And hours longer in-universe.","true":true}
