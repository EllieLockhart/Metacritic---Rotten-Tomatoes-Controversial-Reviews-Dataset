Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While not the Star Wars movie or feel nor the story we are used to. The Star Wars feels hurried\\, poorly written and all for the sake of plot advancement . More of a feeling of SuckerPunch 2- very little to no good linear easy to follow story with no twists or cool scenes. Mostly all action scenes or horribly designed technical flaws\\, such as a character being struck by a torpedo and then surviving the vacuum of space.\\nA very high let down.","true":true}
