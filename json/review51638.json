Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Adding this because it doesn't deserve all the hate. \\n\\nLong story short-\\n\\nLast Jedi answered a few questions from The Force Awakens\\, but it added a whole lot more. \\n\\nIt makes a A LOT of twists \\n\\nIt is not the greatest Star Wars\\, it's far from the worst. \\n\\nIt drags in the middle \\n\\nThere is a lot of great action to be had here\\, and wonderful cinematography.\\n\\nIt nods to but doesn't shamelessly copy another Star Wars (looking at you Force Awakens)\\n\\nSo go see it. It'll be fun and probably won't hurt. Just go in with no particular expectation it'll be a blast.","true":true}
