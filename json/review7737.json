Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Excellent edition to the star wars saga.  There were some moments that seemed forced (comedic lines and that one Leia scene) but overall i thoroughly enjoyed the direction rian johnson took with the film.  this was star wars for me.  i don't understand all the flak this film is getting right now besides everyone wanting Luke to be this super bad ass jedi that just runs around defeating the FO singlehandedly.  \\n\\nAdam driver killed his role as Kylo Ren and i couldn't be more excited to see what he does in Episode 9.  go see the film! i hope you won't be as disappointed as all these haters blowing up this film right now...","true":true}
