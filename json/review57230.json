Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie did not answer questions presented in the force awakens\\, doesn't finish the stories of characters in a deserving way\\, and strays off the main story with sub plots that don't have interesting depth or a satisfying conclusion or even reason for existing. A big slap in the face for star wars fans.","true":true}
