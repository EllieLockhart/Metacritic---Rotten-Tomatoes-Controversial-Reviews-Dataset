Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite what many people say\\, TLJ completely honors and aligns with past Star Wars movies. I agree there are some odd tonal moments\\, but I think of all of the SW movies\\, this one may be the most thematically layered. After my first viewing\\, I wasn\u00e2(TM)t sure what I thought about it other than it was beautifully shot. But\\, the more I watched it\\, I gained a greater appreciation for what Rian Johnson was trying to do with tying up loose ends from previous movies. I thought his treatments of Luke and Leia were completely consistent with their established characters. Most importantly\\, he put the saga back on track for what it means to use The Force and be a Jedi. I wish more people appreciated this installment. There\u00e2(TM)s a lot of great stuff to think about.","true":true}
