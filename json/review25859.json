Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not getting the bad audience reviews but after trying to read through first grade grammer it explains a lot. Plot holes \/ pot holes\\, what is wrong with you people?..Ever hear of having a good time just watching a movie?\\n\\nI was so jazzed after leaving the theater\\, what an awesome epic movie !!!!!","true":true}
