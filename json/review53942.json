Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I actually really enjoyed this movie. It took what The Force Awakens had set up and showed us the other side of all of it - the losses\\, failures\\, and weaknesses of every single one of the characters. It wasn't afraid to take risks. The music and cinematography were incredible. Long-standing fans didn't seem to like it because it \\\"didn't feel like Star Wars\\\"\\, but honestly\\, I think breaking away from the typical Star Wars formula of \\\"Light vs Dark\\\" and \\\"the heroes win the day\\\" was a smart idea. The Last Jedi focused on the grey area in the middle of everything and the inevitability of the war that the characters are now a part of. And I loved every second of it.","true":true}
