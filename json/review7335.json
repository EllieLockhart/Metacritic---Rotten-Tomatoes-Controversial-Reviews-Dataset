Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Episode eight tries to innovate and surprise. However\\, in doing so\\, it loses track of what makes Star Wars what it is and what makes a story-line actually compelling. \\nThere is a lot to say for the film on an audiovisual level\\, yet I fear that these things might fall flat once viewed outside of the theater. Continuity errors are abundant and too obvious to go unnoticed. \\nCharacters change their mind so many times in the 2.5 hours it's infuriating (and not in a good way). This isn't character development anymore\\, it feels more like indecisiveness in the writer room\\, like different writers wanted different arcs for the same characters so they just shoved them all together. \\n\\nIn short; I had goosebumps in theaters\\, but I reckon this won't be the case on a second home viewing and the narrative is so ambitious it falls flat.","true":true}
