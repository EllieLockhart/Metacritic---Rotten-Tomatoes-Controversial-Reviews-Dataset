Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's 3rd best in the entire saga imo. Grittier than the originals and finally moved on from the originals. There isn't anything that can be done about the train wreck that is Kylo Ren at this point\\, but there was plenty of Poe and Rey to take your mind off of it. Less Finn in this one and that's good and I was so glad to see Yoda back and bringing some force with him also. The were a few head scratches with the plot lines\\, but there was still enough to overcome those flaws as well. Me and all my lifelong Star Wars friends all loved it. Not sure Wtf people bashing this movie were wanting.","true":true}
