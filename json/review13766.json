Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If only I could rate this a 0 star\\, Is this even a Star Wars movie?\\n\\nSo\\, this maybe one of my saddest reviews ever.\\n\\nLet me make this clear. I like Star Wars. It's a great franchise\\n\\nSomething that you can just watch and have fun... Or at least it used to be. \\n\\nStar Wars isn't Star Wars anymore\\, Whenever I watch The Last Jedi I constantly vomit\\, because the movie is so disgusting\\n\\nThe sequel movies make Attack Of The Clones look like a masterpiece.\\n\\nI have watched lots of Star Wars over the years\\, and I can't count a single time I haven't puked over the cover of this movie.\\n\\nThe movie is garbage and I can guess that at least 99% of the community also hates this movie.\\n\\nThe SJW's have taken over Lucasfilm and I'm guessing it won't go back to normal any time soon.\\n\\nThe movie would be fine if they removed Canto Bight and Lukes' death\\, but Ivan Ortega is already fixing it so hell yeah.\\n\\nIf you pay for this movie you are actually a fucking retard.\\n\\n0\/5\\n\\nJust subscribe to ComicArtistPro Secrets\\, please do\\, he's great\\, also\\, fuck Disney and Lucasfilm for making this shit","true":true}
