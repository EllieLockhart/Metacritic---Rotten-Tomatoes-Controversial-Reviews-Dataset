Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I found it derivative\\, repetitive and\\, ultimately\\, boring. Not a single interesting idea in the whole film. The plot has plenty of holes and the use of CGI is uneven. They seem to have forgotten what the original films were about\\, where is the magical\\, surprising and imaginative universe of the three original films? Despite all the criticism\\, the prequels are significantly better than the last three films.","true":true}
