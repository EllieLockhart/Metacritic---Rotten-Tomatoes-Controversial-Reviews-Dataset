Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I dont usually do this type of stuff\\, but I was pushed to do this by how bad this movie was. This movie is an insult to  what the star wars story\\, and speacially the first three films\\, stands for. Granted\\, the imagery\\, the photography\\, the sceneries and the music where a thing of marvel\\, they where gorgeous \\,and using the original score with the original director was certainly a great call. But that is where my praise ends.What they did to some of the most beloved characters of this saga\\, specially to luke\\, is insulting.Needless to say that there are several mayor plotholes thorughout the movie\\, but that wasn\u00b4t what really bugged me. What made me really dislike this whole movie was the way they ignored the whole concept of the force. How are we supposed to beleive that ray has such a mastery of the force\\, being that she didint receive any proper training and that just a few weeks ago she didint even beleive in it? How is it at all beleivable that she was capable of fighting luke and bringing him into submission? How can we actually care about the characters\\, speacialy ray\\, when they appear to be invencible and impervious to any danger? How was it that snook was taken down so easily and in such a silly manner? wasn\u00b4t he manipulating and reading both kylo and ray's minds all the time? none of that makes sense. And the scene with leia floating in space and the supermaning her way back to the ship was too much to ask for the viewer i think.","true":true}
