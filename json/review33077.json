Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Stupid subplots that do nothing. Endless scenes lifted from the OT but without suitable emotional context nor involvement for the audience. Nonsensical decisions made by main characters. It's crap. If you like this movie\\, you're either: a kid; a Disney shill; or\\, a cat who is captivated by shiny objects being twirled in front of you.\\n\\nThis movie is a big middle finger from Disney and Rian Johnson while fans reach into their wallets to fork over cash for the endless toys and products they just HAVE to have.\\n\\nDo you like being manipulated? Because that's what's happening. Congrats.","true":true}
