Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For the last 2 years i have been highly anticipating to see my childhood hero come back on the screen to only walk away feeling cheated  with how the character was portrayed and closed.  I compliment the risks that Rian has taken instead of playing a safe hand\\, however in this case feel like none did pay off.\\n\\nThe action pieces were great. The side quest with Finn \/ Rose could of stayed on the cutting room floor as it felt out of place. Alot of questions that were built up from Force awakens such as the knights of Ren \/ Snoke were left unanswered or brushed aside.\\nMy hope now goes out to JJ to salvage this mess and bring full satisfactory closure to this trilogy.  Help us JJ\\, you are our only hope.","true":true}
