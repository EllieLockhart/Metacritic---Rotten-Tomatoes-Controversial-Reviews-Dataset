Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cmon\\, all that money and we get no real story\\, no lore\\, no character development\\, Luke sees chewey and no hug. Wtf. Could someone in Hollywood write a decent script that doesn\u2019t rely on action sequences to promote a good story. Movie was forgettable. ","true":true}
