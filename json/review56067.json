Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many odd choices. First off\\, the battle at the beginning and end are great. I thoroughly enjoyed them. Now for all the stuff in the middle. The majority of this movie is devoted to a slow speed chase\\, where the bad guy are literally just waiting for the good guys to run out of gas. Everything Poe Dameron does is literally pointless\\, and could have been avoided with one conversation between him and his superior. \\nSpeaking of pointless\\, there is no reason for Finn to be in this movie. He goes off on his own adventure\\, that end in him failing his quest\\, but it doesn't matter because his quest wasn't necessary in the first place. \\n\tAll Finn accomplished in the entire film is to free some space animals from captivity\\, but presumably they will just be re-captured. Are these animals important to the plot? No. Okay\\, moving on.\\n\tThe big bad from the previous movie Snoke\\, is also revealed to be pointless\\, along with Luke\\, who Rey seeks out for training\\, but he decided not to train her.\\n\tIn short\\, this movie seemed like a filler episode of a TV show\\, except instead of not movie the plot along it actually set the plot back from where it was last film.","true":true}
