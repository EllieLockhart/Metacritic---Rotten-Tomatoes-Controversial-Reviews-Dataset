Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot was not so good\\, new major characters are poorly developed and heck there a lot of characters that were in there just for the sake of being there. Not all bad tho\\, stellar performence by Oscar Isaac and Mark Hamill.\\n\\nRogue One did A LOT better than this film. If you liked that\\, you might be better off not watching this until episode 9 sorts out all these sloppy plot loose ends that this movie has created.","true":true}
