{"101487":96905,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"1 star out of 5. A half of a star for the visuals and another half of a star for the sound. I feel like I want to give a star to the actors out of pity\\, but I just can't do it. You gotta rate this as a movie within the numbered saga that set up the world before it. Too many inconsistencies\\, thrown away lore\\, thrown away characters\\, plot twists for the sake of gotchas\\, useless side quests\\, liberal social\/political propaganda and emasculation\\, jokes at the expense of drama\\, characters written outside of the core of who they are\\, broken rules of the world. I mean\\, I could go on and on. The fact that this second film of the trilogy was written as a finale\\, it gave no answers to the Chekov gun question's it raised before... What happened to C3P0's red arm? Why did Luke give R2D2 a map if he didn't want to be found? If Snoke could read Rey's mind\\, then how could he not know where Luke was? How come bombs fall in space and why didn't the Dreadnaught have shields? I won't even mention Leia's scene. How does Rey beat Luke who\\, \\\"is the chosen one\\\" and has over 40 years as a Jedi when she didn't even believe in the Force until about a week ago? Who the hell was Snoke and if he is sooo powerful how come he can't detect that he's about to go out like a bitch? Didn't Kylo Ren stop a Blaster Laser heading for his back in the last movie and hold it while he gave a speech and slaughtered the locals? Being that powerful\\, why couldn't he use the force at all against the Praetorian guards? Why don't all the Stormtroopers have the same blaster reflective armor that Phasma has? Again\\, I can keep going...Hole after hole after hole. I didn't even mention the total disrespect to the characters. Luke\\, who saw the good in his father (a man who slaughtered millions of men\\, women\\, and children... Remember\\, he blew up Alderan) and brought him to the light side even hints at murdering his nephew\\, the son of his sister and best friend\\, in his sleep? The last movie left us with him on an extremely dramatic and poignant cliffhanger and he just tosses the lightsaber of his beloved dead father (whose body he dragged out of an exploding death star to burn on a funeral pyre) over his shoulder because Rian thought it would be funny? Would you do that to such an important remembrance of your father? What have we ever had in the past to tell us that Luke would act like that? All this before he also goes out like a bitch? The 1 star I gave it was generous. Nah\\, I gotta drop it from that even... Another reviewer was like this... \\\"If the visuals and sound in this movie were a juicy steak on a plate and then someone just took a bucket-load of shit and dumped it on top and you had to eat through that to get to the steak\\, would you say it was a good meal?\\\" Man...Even now examples of how this movie shit the bed keep popping into my head and I just don't want to write anymore... I can't believe this is canon.","true":true}
