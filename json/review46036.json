Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning\\, but a terrible plot and even more pointless side plot. Rian Johnson seemed more interested in upsetting expectations of the audience than in the story of the characters of this film. In the end I had an unpleasant taste in my mouth that didn't feel like Star Wars. And why put a political message in a Star Wars film\\, despite the fact that it destroyed Ray.","true":true}
