{"101487":121371,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First off... Spoilers. As a Star Wars fan I had high expectations for this movie which was my first mistake. I expected a serious film with a engaging story\\, character development\\, emotional connections\\, and is it too much to ask for them to follow the rules of the universe that they created. Objects do not fall in space\\, so watching a scene that is supposed to make me care about the Poe disobeying orders to destroy a Dreadnaut was made ridiculous. Why have ships that are carrying bombs right next to each other? Moving on to Snope\\, I was told he has the one to hate from the force awakening and now hes shown calling Ben Solo a child with a mask\\, Claiming to see his every intent\\, And ultimately shocked when he is betrayed. We only see a gimps of is force powers with Rey but it felt like he was just written off lazily. Luke and Rey was amazing and i wanted to see more of them training but much time was spent on him acting disinterested. Next we see Lea using the force and although it was done poorly (superman flying) I did like they gave her some spotlight. R2d2 showing luke the original message from Lea was very cool\\, and i felt some emotion.  Also \\\"we are the spark that will light the fire\\\" Love it! So Big plot hole... vice admiral Holdo had a plan the whole time and did not share it with Poe\\, He was already threatening to do something and it would have seriously ended the movie if he just followed with her plan. No need for that story line with Finn and Rose. Also how did the hacker even know about the plan to even tell the first order? No one knew! Hence Poe freaking out about no plan. Iv'e seen the movie 3 times now and still can't see how they explain that. Well to me its lazy and sloppy writing. Rey turning herself in was very cool\\, made me think of return of the jedi. Rey and Ben Solo was a great story\\, their connection\\, the attempts to turn each other. I just wanted more but that is hard when you make a movie that is in a 36 hour time frame. The fight scene was amazing\\, Rey and Ben kick ass. Snope dying though\\, whatever. The end was pretty good\\, with Luke for the win\\, Rey lifting rocks\\, The hope for the next movie. Disney was trying too much to sell a product\\, add humor\\, and destroy the past to make something new. If you ask me it didn't satisfy. I want every gun to fire on that man that ruined Star Wars.","true":true}
