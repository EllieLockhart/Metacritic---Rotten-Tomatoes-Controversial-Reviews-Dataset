Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney has done it\\, they are ruining a beloved franchise to me. People shame the prequels for trying to be comedic and appealing to children. This whole movie has more comedy thrown in for the sake of just trying to be funny. Has long periods that drag and while it does have twists and turns that will shock you it's usually not in a good way. Some good ones. I'm gonna be spoiler free for anyone who hasn't seen it. Watch the 2016 Ghostbusters and the prequels you'll like that more.","true":true}
