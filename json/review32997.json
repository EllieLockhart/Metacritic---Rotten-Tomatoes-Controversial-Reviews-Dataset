Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Story was contrived\\, they didnt follow thru with several story threads\\, this is a sequal not a stand alone movie\\, charcters under devloped some just inserted for reasons(not really story reasons) the action sences were good until your second or third veiw then you can see the flaws like a bad wrestling match. It is a star wars movie it just doeant feel like one.","true":true}
