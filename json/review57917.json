Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a terrible film. most of the plot points that were set up in The Force Awakens were completely dropped from this movie. The film can't decide on what to do with the characters. Writing is absolutely terrible. I was really excited for this movie. I wanted it to be good. I bought the tickets in advance but it was an utter disappointment. there are a few genuinely funny scenes in this movie\\, but they in no way justify it's existence. I was on the fence about going to the theater to see the third movie\\, but after seeing this one I'm definitely not going to see any more Star Wars movies in the theaters.","true":true}
