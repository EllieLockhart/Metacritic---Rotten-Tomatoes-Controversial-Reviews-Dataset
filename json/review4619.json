Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Come on...why are you listening to \\\"critics\\\" of all people?  You mean the folks who graduated with a communications degree and only positively review Arthaus Noir films\\, and sit around in beret's\\, and black turtlenecks\\, eating caviar and bemoaning \\\"normies\\, nerds\\, geeks\\,\\\" and anything that isn't Arthaus Nouveau Borgeoisie?!  We all know critics can't critique sci fi\\, and they can't critique horror.  93% my ass.  They don't know this franchise\\, they didn't grow up with it.  Listen to the majority of the fans.\\n\\nWhere to begin:  spoilers!   Leia has become Superman.  I don't know if somewhere there was a X-over with the D.C. time-space continuum\\, but suffice it to say\\,  Vader is no longer her father\\, I'm pretty sure that Padme had a liason with a certain someone from Krypton.\\n\\nEmo-Kylo-Cries-Alot is pathetic.  Oh yeah\\, he's been working out and he has abs\\, but he still cries at the drop of a hat.  I think he may be pregnant.\\n\\nAnd Luke--where do I even start on that one?  This is NOT the Luke you grew up with.  He's turned into a hideous coward\\, who pouts and cries as much as his nephew does.  I have a feeling if they stuck these two together over a roaring fire at the beach\\, you'd eventually get Kumbaya songs and some kind of new age retreat for men where they get in touch with their feely-weelies and become real male warriors (who are secretly women).  Yes\\, I'm a woman and I just said that.\\n\\nRey has to train herself in the force--and for what it's worth she just popped out of the womb force enabled--no training or anything.  What the???  Even Anakin had to be trained!!!   \\n\\nAnd finally--just No to the ending.  No to the way Luke died.  NO to the whole Finn-Rose\\, \\\"Love wins everything\\\" stupid Disney cartoon crap.  THIS IS WAR!   Sometimes you have to sacrifice in war.  If Hannibal stood on the battlefield and cried out\\, \\\"We can win with LOVE\\,\\\"  Rome would have eaten him\\, and his army\\, alive.  Disney\\, you can make cartoons\\, you can't make epic sci-fi war films based on old shogun films.  You lack the mad skillz necessary to do so.  \\n\\nDisney ruined it.  Give it back to Lucas\\, or to the fans\\, or hell\\, give it to Mel Brooks. Spaceballs was better than this crap.  Watching an old lady cross the street is a better story than this was.","true":true}
