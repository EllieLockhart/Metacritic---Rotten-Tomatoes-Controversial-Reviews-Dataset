Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Left the theatre feeling as if I had missed things\\, but came to the realization that the movie had actually missed crucial elements. SPOILERS: This is movie is a sequel to The Force Awakens which spends quite some time introducing Snoke and Luke Skywalker in a manner that gives something for die-hard fans and well as regulars to look forward to in this new movie. However\\, these two very main characters were thrown under the bus to simply make way for the newer cast. They died very dull and anti-climactic deaths without any real fight (LITERALLY). As far as plot goes\\, it was very slow with many side shows\/unnecessary scenes taking away from the real protagonists and antagonists. Examples include Rose\/Finn casino world\\, everything relating to the codebreaker\\, anything really Poe related\\, Captain Phasma\\, Maz\\, et cetera. Quite frankly there were a lot of unnecessary things that left the plot between this new movie and its predecessor in disarray as well as the fact that it took away time from Luke\\, Rey\\, Kylo\\, and Snoke who are essentially what the main story about the force is about. Things that were left without any real answer are The Knights of Ren(what happened with them)\\, Maz(how did she get the lightsaber)\\, Snoke(what was his deal)[sure he's dead now\\, but to introduce a character only to quickly erase him is lazy story-telling]\\, Rey's training\/power level very inconsistent\\, Rey's parents\\, and finally Luke Skywalker's seemingly absent mindedness(this is the guy who risked life\/death to save his father\\, sister\\, friends so seems out of character). Plot holes were very big and the director seemed to kind of shove them under the rug in preference for anything that would come as a surprise to people. Some things\\, just because they are unexpected does not make them good. This is one of them. I give it 1 star for the look since the CGI\\, props\\, film presentation look good\\, but the plot just has too big of flaws and inconsistencies to ignore as a result of lazy writing and directing.","true":true}
