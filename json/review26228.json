Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not sure why my first review attempt wasn't published. Will try again.\\nBereft of any drama or intrigue. Bizarre dismantling of all the powerful\\, original tropes that evoked universal themes and made a Sunday space opera transcendent.  The deliberate ruin of a great series.","true":true}
