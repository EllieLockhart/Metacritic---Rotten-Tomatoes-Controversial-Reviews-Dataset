Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Huge Fan of Star wars\\, I wasn't a big fan of the Force awakens\\, however I was looking for ward to what they would do with Rey and her training with Luke skywalker. Also of course to see more about Luke becoming the next Grand Master. However\\, all we got a was grand pile of trash. It is sad to see the legendary characters tossed aside so easily. Many plot holes\\, plenty of scenes that were time sinks\\, and stories not answered or wasted from the force awakens. Seriously\\, you are going to save the animals which will get recaptured anyways\\, but leave the kids to endure  slavery and now more hardship because the animals were freed. Read any of the reviews (Not the \\\"pro\\\" critic bot reviews) and you will see why this movie became one more nail in the coffin for future star wars movies.","true":true}
