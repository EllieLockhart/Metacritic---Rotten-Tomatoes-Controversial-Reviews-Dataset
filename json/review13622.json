Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I felt this movie was a slap in the face to lifelong star wars fans.  It started with a crank call\\, it made the bad guys look like fools\\, it made all men childish and incompetent.  It failed to answer any of the questions in intereting way from the previous film.  The politics were cringeworthy.  It rewrote Luke in a unbelieveable way.  It left us with no questions about the future.  I cant understand why this movie went out of its way to drive a majority of its fans away from the film\\, If it was half way respectful to core fans\\, it could still be more inclusive\\, and I would have spent 100's on merchandise\\,  instead I now hate the brand and will boycott unless there is a major course correction.","true":true}
