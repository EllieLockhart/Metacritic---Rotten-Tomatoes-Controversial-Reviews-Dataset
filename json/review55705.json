Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best Star Wars Movies ive ever seen. Its playing with the expactations so much and surprises with every single moment. I was so excited whats happening in the next moment. Thank you for this awesome brigde to Episode 9. Cant wait!","true":true}
