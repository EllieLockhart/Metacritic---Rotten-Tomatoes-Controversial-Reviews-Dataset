Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"9.3\/10  TLJ isn't perfect (Vice Admiral Holdo's plan for one). And yet\\, I don't really care. Our four main characters from the last one are still lovable\\, Luke has a new and compelling backstory with Ren\\, and there's the casino stuff. Okay\\, that wasn't exactly the film's brightest part\\, but it seemed like it existed to show newcomer Rose's personality\\, how far Finn's come from being a Stormtrooper\\, and raise questions about the difference between good and evil. Oh\\, and there's the climax on that salt planet that is just beautiful. Overall\\, TLJ is risky\\, original\\, action-packed\\, and sometimes surprising. In other words\\, it's Star Wars.","true":true}
