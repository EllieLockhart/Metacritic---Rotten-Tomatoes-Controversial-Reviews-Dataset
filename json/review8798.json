Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Forget all the things you wanted it to be\\, things you wanted to happen in the story\\, things you wish didn't happen... all that aside... at it's core\\, TLJ is just poorly conceived disconnected mess of a story\\, that fails in every way to capitalize on anything setup in the previous movie.","true":true}
