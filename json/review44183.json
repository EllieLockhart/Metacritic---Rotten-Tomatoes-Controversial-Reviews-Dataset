Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To me\\, Star Wars has always been about the power of myth and how the films move me. This film did not disappoint. Even though Luke wasn't the Luke we (and Hamill himself) envisioned\\, it was his character that spoke to me the most and provided the insight I needed at a time of adversity. No more wallowing on the island\\, time to get back into the fight! There are many other things I could say about what I liked about this movie but that is the most significant IMO.","true":true}
