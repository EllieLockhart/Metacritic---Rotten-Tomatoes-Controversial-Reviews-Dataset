Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Scaringly resembles the society we live in. Lack of ideas and of stand out characters dominate the movie. \\nTherefore the movie concentrates on unveiling impressive special effects and telling the same story again. \\nChapter 1\\,2\\,3 were not perfect but at least they conveyed emotions and surprise. There was real drama. \\nThis is just another cash cow Holywood production. If you look at blockbuster movies nowadays\\, they all rely on caped heroes and super powers. Did Holywood run out of good stories to tell with strong characters interpreted by charismatic actors?\\nThe force awakens was the same movie than a new hope. And this one mixes empire strikes back and the return of the jedi. Do the filmakers really think it's audience is as shallow as this new trilogy?","true":true}
