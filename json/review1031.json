Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Another great Star Wars Movie! I continue to be impressed on how the older characters and new ones come together. I have been a fan of Star Wars since the beginning of the franchise and this movie was fantastic. The biggest secret of Star Wars is the characters and evolving story line. I highly encourage all to see this movie! Bravo!!!","true":true}
