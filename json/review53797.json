Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Gutted after watching this film\\, just a joke of a movie that's basically a bad fan film that unfortunately is now part of the Star Wars universe affecting the franchise that's ruined childhood heroes and the possibility of what could have been for this franchise.  \\n\\nIf you're a fan of star wars and loved the orig trig\\, the story and characters\\, then please don't watch it. Save your money\\, and your love of the franchise and also 152 minutes of your life! If you're not bothered about story\\, character development\\, reason\\, plot holes\\, or Star Wars\\, then maybe watch it? Actually no\\, I still don't think I would recommend this film to anyone unless you need something loud and nonsensical playing in the background\\, then sure go ahead. \\n\\nThis new trilogy\\, even though it was not off to the best of starts with the Force Awakens\\, at least it HAD potential. But not anymore\\, I believe this new trollidgy will be less fondly remembered than the prequels in years to come. \\n\\nI for one\\, will not be going to the cinema for episode 9. #Notmystarwars","true":true}
