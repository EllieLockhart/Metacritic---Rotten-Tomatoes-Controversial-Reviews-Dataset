Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A huge disappointment.  Weak storyline\\, goose-chase side missions that went nowhere (with corney creatures and aliens). Terribly placed sarcasm and quips inside already stale dialogue. Not to mention Leia's Mary Poppins-like space walk.   My eyes were tired from all the rolling half way through. Luke's broody island was a disaster of unnessesaryness. Snoke was not frightening\\, and brought down with a yawn. In summary \\\"We need to get a way. Ok we got away. The end\\\". Please come back JJ","true":true}
