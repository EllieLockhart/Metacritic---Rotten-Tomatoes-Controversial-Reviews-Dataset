Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Leia flying through space. Extreme disappointment. This movie was a complete waste\\, and not only did nothing for the new series of the franchise\\, but hurt anything the force awakens did. Characters all over the place with zero direction. Dialogue shockingly bad and jokes and humor with bad timing that couldn't have been worse. Propped up moments of sentiment that dripped with disingenuous feelings and words. Vommitted CGI special effects that made it feel like I had been tricked into watching Michael Bay's 13th Transformers movie. These movies meant something to me from childhood\\, and as someone who was excited by so many possibilities brought up by the Force Awakens this is a huge let down. There were smatterings of potential that all ended up squandered and the only positive quality is that there was so much money dumped into this movie that the scenes are cinematically powerful and beautiful.","true":true}
