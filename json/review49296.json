Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie so far.   It should be called Blown Opportunities.     No respect for the audiences curiosity and excitement to find out who Snoke is\\, to see Luke fight as a powerful legend.   Just a total middle finger and boring mess of PC crap on a planet of horse racing and suddend concern about fuel levels..    So Bad it's incedible.    It's worse than any other Star Wars movie as it seems to be bad intentionally.","true":true}
