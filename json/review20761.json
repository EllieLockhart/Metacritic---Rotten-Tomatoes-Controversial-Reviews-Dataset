Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to like it but oddly enough I found the storilines quite flat and lacking intensity\\, momentum and emotional power. I found the movies quite disjointed with battles\/special effects being added as fillers rather than properly integrated in the story. Found the movie dragging but  somewhat redeeming itself towards the end.","true":true}
