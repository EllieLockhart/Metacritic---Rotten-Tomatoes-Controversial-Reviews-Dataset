Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bad plot sacrifices and saves the wrong people more than once.\\nScript seemed like it had too many cooks in the kitchen.\\nThey rehashed parts of Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.\\nNot a lot new here.","true":true}
