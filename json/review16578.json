Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Inconsistent scenario\\, the character of Luke is a pity\\, Leia using the force to get back onboard although the space is close to -273\u00b0c\\, Walt Disney has turned SW into \\\"yet another\\\" Marvel-like franchise.  \\n\\nToo bad since the space battles are amazing and both Rey and Ben Solo evolve interestingly in this opus.","true":true}
