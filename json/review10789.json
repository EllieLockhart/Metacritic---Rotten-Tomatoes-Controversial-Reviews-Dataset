Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hands down the worst Star Wars movie made\\, while there are some enjoyable moments during the film such as the throne room battle most of it is bland and boring and not Star Wars. I was taken out of the film during the opening battle when Poe made the Mother Jokes. Not to even mention Rose or the casino scene.","true":true}
