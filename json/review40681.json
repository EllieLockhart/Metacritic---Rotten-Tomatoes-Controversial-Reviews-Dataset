Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is worse than Rouge One.I had hope as Force Awakens was a great improvement over the more recent Episodes 1-3.  This one was basically a mix of Empire\\, Return of Jedi (down to the dialogue and scenes straight up copied) and mixed in with Disney (replete with Mickey Mouse club kids) and stupid out of place jokes. Too many facepalm moments...too predictable because the dialogue was practically copied form original movies! I need to watch Return of the Jedi (for the umpteen time) for a palette cleanser.  This will be the last SW movie I will see. SMH","true":true}
