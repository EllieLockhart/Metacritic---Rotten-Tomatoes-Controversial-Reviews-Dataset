Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Garbage movie\\, I cant believe I was pulled into it again by the reviews and the hype. I thought the first movie was bad but this movie was a joke. You got me to use my Harkins gift card though\\, well played. \\n\\nReview- Many many plot holes\\, many stupid WTF moments\\, worthless story.","true":true}
