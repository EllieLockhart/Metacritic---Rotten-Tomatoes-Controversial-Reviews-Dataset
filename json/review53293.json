Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Completely underwhelmed. I left the theatre deep in thought\\, really trying to make sense of the movie\\, and trying to come up with something decent to say about it. But I genuinely can\u2019t. First of all Kylo is a p***y. Secondly\\, there were zero good spacefights\\, you can\u2019t have a good star wars movie without a really good edge of your seat spacefight. Third\\, the character development was absolutely trash as was the plot. The entire plot was them running out of fuel and getting blown up-then to keep it fresh\\, they decided to send Finn out with someone else to run into Benicio Del Toro? But candidly that wasn\u2019t a great idea either because nothing really happened\\, there was zero real plot development. Two of the most unbelievable things that were absolute garbage\\, Leia somehow flying back into the command deck after being sucked into he vacuum of space. Cmon guys\\, I\u2019m watching a story about literal laser swords and even I can\u2019t get with Leia floating back onto the deck. Secondly\\, Luke is a titular character\\, for his to retreat like that and not have an excellent hero worthy death is just a bush league move. Two Props I will give the film: The rebel ship jumping into hyper space and knocking out half of the imperial fleet. Kylo Ren had a pretty cool headshot with the old blue saber. Otherwise\\, a true disappointing\\, unauthentic venture into what otherwise would\u2019ve been something to keep me interested for the next installment. ","true":true}
