Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Let the past die.\\\"\\n\\nSage advice in the form of a line said by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver)\\, which constitutes just about the only worthwhile dialogue in this ill-conceived\\, sloppy mish-mash of Original Trilogy callbacks\\, inexplicable character choices\\, redundant action sequences\\, silly technology\\, narrative amnesia\\, tedious exposition\\, treacly nonsense\\, and just plain old bad acting.","true":true}
