Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Impossible to invest in story or characters as none of it makes any sense. It bears no logical connection to any of the other SW films\\, and even as a stand-alone film it is poorly written. \\n\\nThe Director\/writer should be utterly ashamed of himself. What a mess.","true":true}
