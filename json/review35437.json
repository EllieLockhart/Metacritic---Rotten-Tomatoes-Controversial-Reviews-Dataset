Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi defies all expectations. It\u2019s a movie about outgrowing black and white viewpoints\\, recognizing failure as a valuable learning opportunity and boys leaning how to act like men. The blowback is very telling. Go in with no preconceived notions of what it should be and prepare to still be surprised. It\u2019s way better on your second viewing once the shock has worn off. I loved this movie. ","true":true}
