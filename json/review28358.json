Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Possible the best written movie of the saga.  A brilliant film that reveals more each time you see it.   Cannot express how fantastically written and executed this sequel to Force Awakens is.  A truly great cinematic experience.  Visually stunning\\, witty\\, fast-paced and satisfying for a long time fan.","true":true}
