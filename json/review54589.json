Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not sure if I've ever been this disappointed with a Star Wars film. Sure\\, the acting was great\\, the battle sequences were great\\, the new creatures were fun\\, there were a couple of cool twists and a welcome reappearance from puppet Yoda\\, and I LOVE the new emphasis on strong female characters.\\n\\nBUT the plot pretty much sucked. Yes\\, a lot happened. But did any of it amount to anything? No\\, not really. It was all just the First Order chasing the Resistance\\, the Resistance trying to escape. There was lots of plot but no plot progression at all. At the end\\, we were virtually in exactly the same place we were at the end of \\\"The Force Awakens\\\"\\, minus some key character deaths (some of the cool twists I mentioned). \\n\\nAnd there were so many scenes ripped straight out of previous Star Wars films. The Ren\/Luke confrontation was a combo of the Obi-Wan\/Vader confrontations from \\\"A New Hope\\\" and \\\"Revenge of the Site\\\"\\, even with similar lines. The Snoke\/Ren\/Rey confrontation was a close remake of Luke\/Emperor\/Vader in \\\"Return of the Jedi\\\". The overarching plot was too similar to \\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\" and all the battles didn't feel particularly different to anything we've seen before either. \\n\\nI expected so much more. Despite having some dodgy acting\\, bad dialogue and huge over-reliance on CGI\\, there's one thing the prequels had in droves and\\, for me\\, made them better films than these sequels - and that's decent\\, original plots.","true":true}
