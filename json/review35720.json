Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi is basically Director Rian Johnson punching everything that is Star wars square in the face. Then throwing it the middle finger\\, then kicking it to the ground and finally taking a almighty c**p all over it.\\n\\nHe then wraps up the remains with beautiful fight scenes and space battles\\, with sprinklings of social justice and feminist ideology to keep Kathleen Kennedy and the feminists happy. \\n\\nWorst Star wars ever.","true":true}
