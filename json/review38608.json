Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars movie in the franchise.First week good income just cause of Force awaken end epic like that.\\n\\nSpoiler alert:\\n\\nSnoke die too stupid at this ep. If he die in ep9 may be not that bad.\\nRey parent \\,lol to the plot sucks. If this is first or second movie is acceptable\\, but is this Star wars\\, epic and long history. How Rey parent is no one\\, lol\\nRose part is most sucks.\\nPeople he rate is movie over 5 may be just kid age not over 15 years old or brainwash type.","true":true}
