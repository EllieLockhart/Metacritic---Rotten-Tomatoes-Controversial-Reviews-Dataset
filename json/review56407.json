Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The acting is well done\\, but the character development is lacking and the plot holes are glaring. I'm sure the hyperspace ramming has been mentioned in other reviews\\, but there's only so far you can go with suspension of disbelief. If Rose and Finn can escape together to a distant system\\, and then return\\, undetected\\, why can't everyone take turns sneaking off and on in this fashion? BB-8 incapacitating and tying up guards with only an orb for a body? \\n The First Order has a tracker on just one ship\\, so why don't all the other ships jump to hyperspace and just abandon the lead ship with the tracker on it? Why can't the New Order just use hyperspace to jump in front of the resistance ships and surround them? How did Rey get on the Millenium falcon after leaving the Supremacy on Snoke's personal ship? How did an injured Finn and Rose run all the way back to the Salt world base without being killed by all the First Order troops that were standing right next to them? As a sci-fi movie its watchable\\, as a Star Wars movie\\, I expected more.","true":true}
