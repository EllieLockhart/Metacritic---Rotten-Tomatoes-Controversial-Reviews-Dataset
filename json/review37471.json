Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is no return. Star Wars is over for me\\, this Movie was not good ooo action with garbage story.. I am so disenchanted I will never participate in the Star Wars franchise in anyway ever again. That is a promise. I have never felt such a need to review a movie ever even though i was tempted to do so with (IT). Even if Disney ever manages to make it out of the Sewer They will be covered in ****.","true":true}
