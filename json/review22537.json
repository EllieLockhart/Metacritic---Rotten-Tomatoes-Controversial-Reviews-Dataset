Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let's face it: this is nothing for fiftysomethings who have seen the first movies of the saga. Predictable dialogues with key sentences that apparently have been used before\\, the most lively actors where the robots and most of the humorous scenes were targeting a significantly younger audience. The animation was stunning though. But that is not enough. But ok. That's the trouble with remakes (and that's what it is after all). ...and what a brilliant idea to use the Force for long-distance calls!","true":true}
