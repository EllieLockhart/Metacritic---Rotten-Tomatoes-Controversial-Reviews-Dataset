Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie felt more like some sort of Samurai movie or Marvel movie than a star wars movie. A good movie but it didn't feel like Star Wars at a lot of points. The acting was superb. The visuals were stunning. It wasn't Star Wars. The plots and visuals felt so far removed from what the original trilogies were. There's nothing wrong with remixing and originality but\\, this movie fell flat. The last twenty or so minutes are what make this movie fall flat. It felt more like a rushed conclusion to what is supposed to be a plot spanning across three movies. I'm hopeful for a better Episode IX but I'm VERY cautious. I would still see this movie but be aware that \\\"this isn't going to go the way you think.\\\"","true":true}
