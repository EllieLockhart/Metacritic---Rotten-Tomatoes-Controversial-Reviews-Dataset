Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let's get one thing straight: if you only want new Star Wars films to retell the old films with new characters (like TFA) and balk at any change\\, you will probably be disappointed.\\n\\nThe older fans might still remember the outcry that happened when Chewbacca was killed off in the Expanded Universe\\, before there was Disney to blame (of course\\, that was 1999 when people had other reasons to complain about Star Wars). It's the kind of outcry that always happens when a beloved franchise dares to go new ways.\\n\\nThis\\, basically\\, is The Last Jedi in a nutshell: an attempt to prevent the universe from becoming a stale retread of old stories. Is it perfect? No. But neither is any other Star Wars film. But it is entertaining and moving with the right amount of heart\\, surprises and excitement which is worthy of the franchise.\\n\\nIn the end\\, everyone should make up their own mind of course and so I urge anyone reading this to ignore the barrage of negative comments and just see the film. Like always with the internet\\, a tiny vocal minority can distort the perception because those unsatisfied have more reasons to voice their frustration. When I saw it the day it came out\\, the whole theater was full of happy fans and I heard not a single bad word about it afterwards. I doubt that I was in the only theater full of people who liked the film.\\n\\nPS: imagining a grand conspiracy in which Disney bribed more than 90% of critics worldwide might make some people feel better than to consider that they might be in the wrong. But that does not change the fact that there is no such conspiracy.","true":true}
