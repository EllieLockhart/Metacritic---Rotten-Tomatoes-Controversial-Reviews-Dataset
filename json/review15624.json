Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved the movie. The issues that so many people have with TLJ is that it defies their own opinions\/hopes of how characters should or shouldn't have turned out. We cannot expect a story to progress if the characters do not evolve.\\n\\nThe film was unexpected and unpredictable. The plot holes many are complaining about are not irredeemable. Are people forgetting we still have another movie? \\n\\nMy advice to anyone wanting to see the movie who is on the fence; Go in with no expectations. I think too many are going into the movie with unattainable expectations\\, and then they come out pissed and thirsty for blood when their own hopes are dashed. \\n\\nAll in all it is a great movie that does not deserve the harsh backlash it is receiving.","true":true}
