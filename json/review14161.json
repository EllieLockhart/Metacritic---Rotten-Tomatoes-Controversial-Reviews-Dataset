Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you watched this movie without any previous knowledge of any Star Wars movies\\, it could be decent.  It moves slow\\, and certain characters that don't seem all that important get a lot of screen time.  But there are some scenes which will surprise\\, their is some humor\\, and there is a cool space battle scene.\\n\\nIf you are familiar with the previous Star Wars movies\\, this movie is a major letdown.  The \\\"rules\\\" of Star Wars seem to be abandoned here\\, a cherished character seems to have had a dramatic shift in personality\\, and the brand new characters eat up a lot of time that you'd prefer were spent on others.\\n\\nOne of the issues that really stuck out to me is that the movie assumed viewers had already developed strong connections to certain characters.  That was not the case for me\\, and it felt like the director hadn't earned the audience's engagement before trying to utilize that engagement to create an emotional reaction.\\n\\nAfter watching this movie\\, I have no interest in seeing the next one.","true":true}
