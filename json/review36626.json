Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is a study in nihilism. Nothing matters. There are no heroes anymore. They character assassinated and killed off Luke Skywalker\\, the most iconic and important character in Star Wars and thereby killed off the whole franchise. End of story. Should have gotten less than one star\\, but then it wouldn't be counted. I just can't wait to not see episode 9\\, and this is coming from a fan who has read most of the original books(not Disney)\\, played the games and the roleplaying games. Rian Johnson may say he's a fan\\, but he obviously is not or he's just so arrogant that he believes that he can reshape 40 years of history. The movie is the total destruction of a franchise by destroying everything that made the story good in the first place.","true":true}
