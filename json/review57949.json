Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Whats the point of watching a movie that doesn't follow lore? If i wanted more cheap performance i would go with Volkswagen if i wanted cheap realiability i would go with Toyota and whats the point of buying a Toyota if it becomes expensive and unreliable? Big studio or company should only hire people who are big fan and would put their heart and soul out to make it great and remind people what they are watching.","true":true}
