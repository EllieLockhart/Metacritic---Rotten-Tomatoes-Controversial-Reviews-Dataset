The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Overall\\, this is a great game\\, despite it being different from what I expected in multiple ways\\, the most prominent being the story.

I'll be reviewing the game by category\\, then adding up the categories to create a numerical score.\r\rGameplay: The gameplay is excellent. It is incredibly smooth\\, and while it is similar to the gameplay of the original game\\, it feels very refined and in general is faithful to the original while also being improved. The combat also feels quite good\\, with weapons feeling very substantial and rewarding to use. 10\/10.\r\rGraphics: This may be the best looking game available on console right now. The scenery is beautiful and the character models are excellent. There really is nothing to complain about as far as graphics are concerned\\, and thus\\, 10\/10.\r\rSound: Like the graphics\\, the sound is excellent. The guns sound as substantial as they feel\\, if not more so. The environments also sound fantastic. The voice acting is wonderful\\, especially from Troy Baker (Joel) and Ashley Johnson (Ellie). 10\/10.\r\rStory: The story is by far the most controversial part of this game\\, with many people disliking the direction of the developers. Unlike some people\\, I have finished the game and intentionally waited to review it until then. Overall\\, the story is good\\, but not great. I would perhaps have made some different choices than the developers did\\, but they do a good job telling the story nonetheless. It is not as good as the first game\\, but I believe part of that sentiment is caused by the fact that this game is much darker. The tension between the characters is noticeable and well-done\\, and while some people may not like the fact that the multiple stories are told in a way that sometimes feels somewhat stilted or disjointed\\, I did not find it to be a big issue. The end of the game does a good job of tying all of the stories together and the narrative ends up being powerful\\, if somewhat less than ideal for some players. 7\/10.\r\rFun factor: Overall\\, I had fun playing The Last of Us Part II. Some will call it a walking simulator with a small amount of combat\\, and while cutscenes are very prevalent\\, I think calling the game a walking simulator is unfair. If anything\\, it is an interactive movie. Like I mentioned earlier\\, I thought the combat was good and I enjoyed the many times I had to fight. I have played games that were more fun than TLOU2\\, but I found it to be more enjoyable than most. 8\/10.\r\rIn conclusion\\, I found The Last of Us Part II to be fairly well-told story that was dark and emotional. I enjoyed my experience\\, which was carried largely by the excellent presentation and fun\\, substantial feeling combat. All together\\, I give this game 45\/50\\, or 9.0.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
