Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From a fan of the original 3 films (4\\,5&6) I thought number 7 was good \\, but felt slightly like a re-run of the old films. This one\\, The Last Jedi #8\\, was awesome! The story was good\\, the acting was great and the special effects rocked! I would see this again! I also highly recommend seeing it in Imax. I received movie money for a Christmas gift and used it to try it out. WOW for this kind of movie it was an experience. Like it much better than 3D. ","true":true}
