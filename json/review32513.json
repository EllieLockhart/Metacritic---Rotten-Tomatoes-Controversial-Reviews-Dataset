Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi - 4 out of 5 - The continuing story of Rey\\, Poe\\, Finn and the Resistance vs. Kylo Ren and the First Order. This is hard without spoiling anything so it might not be the most exciting review. This is probably the most in depth movie in the Franchise and its such an emotional Roller Coaster. Some good news that will not spoil anything. The Porgs are nothing like Jar Jar Binks they do not ruin the movie. This you must go see in theaters I recommend The Goodrich Quality Theaters probably the most comfortable and affordable theater around. this is a must see for all Star Wars fans if your not a Star Wars what the hell is wrong with you. Catch Up.","true":true}
