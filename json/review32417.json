Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars is heading in a new direction\\, that\u2019s definitely a good thing\\, fans from this saga are very hard to please. This movie clearly has great cinematography \\, amazing shots\\, great composition\\, phenomenal acting specially Mark Hamill and Adam Driver but the script in some points has it\u2019s flaws like for example the running out of fuel following of the Resistance\u2019s main ships and the Casino sequence could have been shortened in order to fit more Samurai-esque lightsaber showdowns and some more Force educational sequences. Also the music is not so piercing like John William\u2019s other past soundtracks.","true":true}
