Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is nothing but a cash cow for Disney. Real Star Wars movies used to have a soul. This one  is just a soulless CGI porn mixed with bad acting and zillions of plot holes. Rey is a Jedi master with abilities she gained out of thin air with no training at all. Kylo is a kid with a mask as Snoke stated in the movie. Snoke is a villain with zero background who dies in the most possible ridiculous way.  Luke Skywalker is no longer Luke Skywalker! He is just there to give the impression that this is a Star Wars movie.\\n\\nAnyways\\, the last real Star Wars movie was filmed by George Lucas. This new series is just a bad copy of the original.","true":true}
