Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing. Would have been good for a stand alone project. Shouldn't have been part of the saga.  Very lazy way to deal with some of the story from TFA. The story was ok\\, but if this felt like episodes 8&9 in one episode. Rian Johnson Killed Star Wars\\, and started his own series in the middle of what we knew as Star Wars","true":true}
