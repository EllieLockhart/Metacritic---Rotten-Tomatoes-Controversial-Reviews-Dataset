Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No clue how critics could give this movie so much praise with all the plot holes and terrible character development. To be fair the movie was visually stunning but left me empty after leaving the movies. *not a bot\\, just decided to create a account and warn people of this terrible film* #notmystarwars","true":true}
