Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie wasn't what I expected\\, but I liked how it wasn't. Sure\\, it wasn't the best Star Wars movie but it still holds up as good. It was visually stunning and brought back old characters in a great way. There were parts that could have been done better such as Finn\\, Rose\\, and Poe's plan to save the ship. However\\, I liked how they went on to that planet. It showed how corrupted the Galaxy has become and it even gives us a bit of hope by showing the children\\, especially at the end of the movie. The movie finally showed Leia and her force powers. This movie actually showed how the force feels and gave further description of what it is. Kylo Ren's feelings were focused on very deeply which I personally think was well done\\, both in the script and Adam Driver's acting. I went into the theatre thinking I would be able to predict what would happen in this movie. I ended up having no idea what would happen next which is a change for me. The movie also featured many instances where\\, if they were paying attention\\, the audience was reminded of the original movies. (Spoiler) An example being Luke's death at the end where he sees two suns in the sky which is almost exactly like the shot we see in A New Hope when he is first introduced. The Last Jedi was about being something new\\, yet holding onto the old at the same time. With further examination\\, I believe it accomplished that quite well.","true":true}
