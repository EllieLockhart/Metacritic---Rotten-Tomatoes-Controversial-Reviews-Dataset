Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was not very good. It just never felt like a star wars movie. Rogue One was great but this was not. the special effect was spot on just the plot and the way they portrayed Luke Skywalker. the man that saved his father from the dark side. whom never gave up just gives up on his own nephew?? like really how does that workout?","true":true}
