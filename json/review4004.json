Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Boring\\, story is almost static for the first half of this very long movie.  Apparently the future of the entire resistance rests on the fate of 3 relatively small ships which have been extremely avoidably put at risk of being obliterated.  Some interesting plot twists and emotional moments.  Terrible lack of action and meaningful\\, exciting battles.  In a universe where only this current star wars trilogy existed\\, it would be an okay development of another modern big blockbuster storyline of the same signifigance as marvel and DCs current cinematic universes.  But in the context of the entire cinematic star wars universe\\, this movie is utterly disappointing trash.","true":true}
