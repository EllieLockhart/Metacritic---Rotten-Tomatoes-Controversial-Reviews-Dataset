Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was exceptional\\, especially when you went in with NO EXPECTATIONS. It was different then the others\\, and FELT different and that is what we all needed in this age of movie madness. As long as you felt something\\, good or bad\\, while watching this movie than you deserve to give it 5 stars.","true":true}
