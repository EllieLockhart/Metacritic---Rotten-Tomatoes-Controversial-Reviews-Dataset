Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie made me cheer for the bad guys. So much opportunity to turn this into a great movie. Are the good guys in this movie ever going to knocked off? Christ even the dead character in real life in tihis movie does not get killed off to create s smooth transition to the next movie. I am not sure if I am the only one\\, but I truly feel robbed by this one . The worst part is I was so excited about this movie that I decided to watch it a couple days before I took my son to go see it. I now have to pay and sit through this disaster again.","true":true}
