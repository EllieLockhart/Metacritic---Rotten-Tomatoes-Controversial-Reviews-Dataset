Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Does not hold true to the Star Wars story and world. That mixed in with all the poor character arcs\\, pathetic story line\\, made TLJ one of the biggest missed opportunities of all time.","true":true}
