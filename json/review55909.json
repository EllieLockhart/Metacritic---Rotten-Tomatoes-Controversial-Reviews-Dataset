Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"REVIEW: Star Wars The Last Jedi\\, Great but Still Leaving Many Questions (CONTAINS SPOILERS)\\nBy Ziggy Last Updated December 17\\, 2017\\n\\nShare\\nTweet\\nPin\\nOk so I just got back from the movie theater seeing Star Wars: The Last Jedi and it's taking every ounce of energy I have left in my body as this film completely wiped me out.  So many of my friends who haven't seen The Last Jedi yet\\, immediately texted me asking how the movie was\\, and I was at a loss for words.  Let me start out by saying it was a great movie\\, and a worthy successor to The Force Awakens (in fact I liked it better on first view)\\, but it still leaves many questions unanswered\\, 16 of them to be exact! ??\\n\\nIn The Last Jedi Trailer you hear Luke say: \\\"This is not going to go the way you think.\\\" and that pretty much sums up this film.  There is one twist after another.\\n\\nBefore I go on any further\\, let me warn you that THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.  So if you haven't yet seen the movie\\, don't read my The Last Jedi review\\, unless you don't care about getting things spoiled for some strange reason.\\n\\nI'm not kidding!  Don't leave me any nasty comments on my site saying you weren't warned because I'm telling you THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!\\n\\nOk now that that's out of the way...\\n\\nThe Last Jedi is a technical and visual marvel and is everything you've come to expect from this new generation of Star Wars films.  But the film's strength is how it builds on The Force Awaken's strong point\\, which are its interesting and lovable characters.  Watching The Last Jedi you get to know those characters that you were already deeply invested in over the last two years a bit more\\, and watch their growth right before your eyes.  Director Rian Johnson takes massive risks with the characters\\, the majority of which pay off.  BB-8 stole the show as he did last time\\, but Rey\\, Poe\\, Finn\\, and Kylo are also strong.  And Mark Hamill gives what might be his best version of Luke Skywalker that he has ever done.  There were a few parts in the middle of the film where it seemed to tread water\\, but the thrilling finale made up for any slow parts.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe film has in my opinion just the right amount of humor\\, making it funny but keeping serious at the same time.  I know some have complained saying The Last Jedi is too funny\\, but those same people forget that during Empire\\, Han\\, C-P30 and the gang were essentially a walking comedy act\\, yet it worked.  I thought Rian Johnson hit on working in just enough humor\\, making it perfect.","true":true}
