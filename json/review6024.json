Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointment of the year - poorly paced with undeveloped characters despite a long running time. There was no clear story due to several stories running in parallel. The comedy undermined the action\\, of which there's plenty but rarely engaging. Benicio del Toro was the most interesting character when but came and went all too quickly. Ultimately\\, there was a much better story to be told and I came out of the screening with little interest in seeing the next one.","true":true}
