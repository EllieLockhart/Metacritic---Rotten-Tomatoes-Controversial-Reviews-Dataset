Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely terrible movie\\, is star wars dead? If you like boring twists and yawn-worthy characters\\, last jedi is for you. This movie as stated in many other reviews\\, takes iconic characters and disables them into extremely poor adaptations of what they once were.","true":true}
