Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Movie was ambitious\\, and I am grading it in part because it was so ambitious. This movie needed a central protagonist and when you have moments when Rey is the Protagonist everything seems to work best. Poe and Finn were both given stuff to do and the plot gave them stuff to do to create stakes at the expense of the actual emotional stakes of the parts of the movie that work. Its politics plot is only marginally less stupid then the politics plot of The Prequels. And is like it was written by a college freshman. The film tries to make that stuff its heart and it doesnt work. Its perspective on heroism is supposed to be a subversion of heroism but it clubs you over the head with it. And it clubs you because the Finn-Poe-Rose parts of the movie take up time used to benefit that narrative","true":true}
