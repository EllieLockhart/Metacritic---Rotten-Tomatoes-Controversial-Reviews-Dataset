Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"This is not going to go the way you think!\\\"  \\n   We heard Luke Skywalker tell us this in the trailer\\, and it rings true here.  I have seen this film twice\\, and I needed the first time through to accept what I was being presented as helmed by Rian Johnson.  Many of THE FORCE AWAKENS' major \\\"mystery box\\\" of questions are smacked down right in front of our face.  Knowing this is only the second film in this new trilogy\\, we shall see if some of these questions are only seemingly answered in this film\\, only to slap us in the face once more in episode 9.  Let's be honest.  STAR WARS has never shied away from presenting new mysteries or debunking old ones from a \\\"certain point of view.\\\"  We shall see.\\n\\nAll the performances are once again top notch.  Mark Hamil\\, Daisy Ridley\\, Oscar Isaac\\, Domhnall Gleason\\, John Boyega\\, Kelly Marie Tran\\, etc are all great.  Laura Dern was a welcome and refreshing addition\\, and did quite a bit with what she was given.  I also want to give major props to the great Andy Serkis for his chilling performance of Supreme Leader Snoke.  Brilliant. Special props to Carrie Fisher.  She really did leave us a touching and affecting performance in her swan song.  Mark Hamil is so good as Luke.  His best performance as the hero of my generation!  My favorite acting performance though is without question Adam Driver as Kylo Ren.  My fellow Mishawaka\\, IN native is turning into one of my favorite actors working today.  STAR WARS films have produced some of the greatest villains in film history\\, and THE LAST JEDI does not disappoint here whatsoever.  To me\\, Kylo Ren is the most interesting persona in this universe.  I cannot wait to continue learning more about his story and why he turned evil.  The visual effects are top notch.  I was impressed with the battle sequences\\, and the way they merged Andy Serkis' master mo-cap performance with CGI.\\n\\n    The weak points are noticable. There is some uneven sequences throughout the second act\\, which prevents this film from surpassing its predecessor.  The highs are some of the best ever in STAR WARS\\, and the low points are some of the most lackluster (albeit only in small doses within the second act).  The 3rd act is spectacular and thrilling.  There is more humor this time around than one would expect for a second chapter\\, but in my opinion\\, most of it works.\\n\\n    I would rate this film a 8.5 out of 10.  THE FORCE AWAKENS is more consistent and even\\, but THE LAST JEDI takes more risks.  This is a very\\, very good\/great STAR WARS film.  I will obviously see this movie a bunch more times over the next couple years\\, so we shall see where it places in the pantheon of STAR WARS live action flicks\\, but for now\\, here is my order:\\n\\n1. THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (A+)\\n2. A NEW HOPE (A)\\n3. THE FORCE AWAKENS (A-)\\n4. THE LAST JEDI (A-)\\n5. RETURN OF THE JEDI (A-)\\n6. ROGUE ONE (B+)\\n7. REVENGE OF THE SITH (B)\\n8.
