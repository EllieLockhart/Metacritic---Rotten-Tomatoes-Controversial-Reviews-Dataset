Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The director used a beloved film to push his own political views instead of providing any form of story\\, character development or anything of true meaning. Utter rubbish\\, if there is any justice the third film will start with Rey opening her eyes and TLJ was all just a bad deam.","true":true}
