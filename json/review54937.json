Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's sad\\, but I assisted to the destroying of SW.\\nSPOILER INSIDE\\, WATCH OUT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll saga is based on conflict between good\/evil inside us... and on the fact that everyone could be saved if some \\\"good will\\\" is still inside him.\\nIt was sad seeing a mother (leia) saying (with)  his brother\\n(luke) that his son (in conflict) is lost forever... Vader\/Anakin yes... his son lost forever... oh dear. \\n\\nRidicolous engagement between enemy fleet and rebel fleet... 18 hours in the future space to reach a position? Are you kidding me? Who wrote this... and why? :D\\n\\nLuke Skywalker... destroyed as character of the saga... (Lucas... why... WHY YOU SOLD YOUR DREAM?)... dead in a way that seems the way \\\"kill the old and get the new\\\".... no other good ideas from writers? Using old to call ppl and make money to kill them that way... lol. \\n\\nMaze and leader snoke in the trama are now \\\"ok\\, we joked last movie\\, they were there but it was for fun\\, now cutted them off without a real exit strategy\\\"... tnx to the writers again\\, we are all proud of you! \\n\\nIn few other words... an abandoned saga to create a empty xmas blockbuster movie with special effects only... \\n\\nJJ (he is still in the last jedi)\\, please... stop doing remake\\, don't steal other ideas\\, do your own sci fi movie\\, you can do it... not sw (or star trek)... \\nAnd Disney is the real dark side of the show biz... \\\"eating\\\" everything without a real idea except making money like in a bigmarket. \\n\\nIn the end\\, as a sci fi is a 3 stars on 5\\,as sw movie is less than 1...poor George... what have they done...","true":true}
