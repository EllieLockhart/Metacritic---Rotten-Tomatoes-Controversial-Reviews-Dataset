Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Contrary to what many critics said\\, The Last Jedi is not only a bad Star Wars\\, it's a bad movie. For the \\\"bad Star Wars\\\" part\\, Rian Jonhson abandoned almost all the avenues proposed by J.J. Abrams in The Force Awakens and spit on Star Wars fandom without any purpose. Also\\, he didn't seem to know what to do with both new and original characters and forced in new characters for whom he created no attachment at all. Although some critics praised the boldness of the film\\, I was astonished to see that he literally copied scenes from Empire and Return of the Jedi\\, which made me laugh at the theater. For de \\\"bad movie\\\" part\\, the film feels more like  a mini-series in which the plot is either implausible or useless. Perhaps Johnson could have made a decent Star Wars standalone movie\\, but it seems to me that he was clueless for taking part in a trilogy that\\, again\\, J. J. Abrams had to rise from ashes as best as he could. The star and a half goes for some good action sequences\\, a few surprises\\, great special effects (as usual) and music (as usual).","true":true}
