Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sad to say it but this was not a good movie. Perhaps we are just fooling ourselves into thinking that the original magic of Star Wars could be caught in a bottle\\, but if it can...it just wasn't here (I feel like they came close in Rogue One.) The \\\"humor\\\" didn't add to the tension the way it did in the originals\\, here it just made me feel like they weren't taking the situation seriously. We waited decades to see Luke again with a great cliff-hanger at the end of The Force Awakens\\, and what is he? A misanthropic geezer who barely survives the second act. The whole thing just felt like a big \\\"up yours\\\" to the fans. I know you can't make everyone happy...but you should have your priorities straight on who you should try to make happy.","true":true}
