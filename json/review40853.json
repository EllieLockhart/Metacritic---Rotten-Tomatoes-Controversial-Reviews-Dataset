Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie completely ruined the star wars feel and should be G-rated\\, as anyone over the age of 9 can see that there are a lot of holes in the plot\\, horrible emotional toning with simultaneously attempting humor while attempting serious emotion. This was not fun to watch\\, and despite the incredible CG\\, it just can't make up for the character flaws\\, plot inconsistencies\\, and forced political messages written by Rian Johnson. I hated this moive.","true":true}
