Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So fun! had a blast. was in it the whole time. i love where and how this sory has evolved. i love that the trilogies are so related. the stories are really all about the same family. its not some random movies. im glad they have kept that.","true":true}
