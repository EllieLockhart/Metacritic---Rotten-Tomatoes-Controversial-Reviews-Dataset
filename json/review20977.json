Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was hoping the audience reviews were off\\, but I gotta say The Last Jedi was a swing and a miss.  It's rather baffling what Disney was trying to accomplish\\, Kylo moves forward as the weak \\\"strongest presence of the force\\\" that is just a gigantic let down and Rey continues to have little to no training but gets the better of Kylo constantly.  Why can't we get a good Star Wars film worthy of the originals?","true":true}
