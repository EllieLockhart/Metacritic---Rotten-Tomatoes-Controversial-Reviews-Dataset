Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Memorable performance by Mark Hamill playing Luke Skywalker one more time. Unfortunately he is not strong enough in the force to stop my hart being torn out. I would have laughed at this film if it wasn't Star Wars. On the bright side; it did teach me to appreciate \\\"The Phantom Menace\\\". (the one star should be a half one but thay are ewxcluded in the tally)","true":true}
