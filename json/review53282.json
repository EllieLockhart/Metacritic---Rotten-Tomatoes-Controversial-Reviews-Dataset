Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Complete and utter trash. Entire movie was built around political agenda. To each their own as far as beliefs\\, but do not try to make a story fit into a political agenda. Pointless plot lines\\, poor character development\\, not staying true to old characters. Luke\\, who refused to kill the baddest dude in the galaxy\\, was going to kill his padawan. Come on son. All the build up in episode 7 led to nothing. It was almost one big fu to JJ. The Rey parents thing\\, \\\"we didn't want you to have to be a part of a certain family to be a Jedi\\\".... did no one pay attention to the prequel? Anikan married in secret because they were not allowed to have families. So every other Jedi aside from the Skywalker was not a part of a certain lineage. What a load of an excuse. I liked Rey in the first one\\, but every Jedi needs training. Where is hers? I don't mind she is a woman like Disney is trying to portray. Like I said\\, I liked her I n force awakens. And Luke's character was destroyed. That isn't like. He would have left his sister to die","true":true}
