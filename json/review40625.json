Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst Star Wars movie. Worst than the Phantom Menace. I was in the theater shaking my head in disbelief of how poor the writing was and how terrible the pathetic attempts of humor. How unimaginative the plot was. I do not know what sort of issue Kathleen Kennedy have with men\\, but i am smart enough to recognize misandry (hate of men) when I see it. \\nToo bad\\, they are going to lose a lot of money. I will suggest Disney to remove her before she turns Star Wars into another Ghostbusters 2016 or  DC. They killed the whole franchise with this movie. I am not interested in episode 9.","true":true}
