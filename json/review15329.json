Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ill give 1 1\/2 stars because the visual effects were good. But the story was just bad. How does Mary Sue beat Luke skywalker in a fight? Isnt Luke Skywalker supposed to be the most powerful Jedi ever? Also\\, Add some flaw to Ray!! Holy hell\\, we get it\\, you want to promote women\\, but most of your Star Wars fans dont care about gender or what kind of orifice you like to mate with. We want to escape the monotonous bland standard SJW political world we live in. Not pay $15 to watch it in a Theater.","true":true}
