Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great Show! Don't listen to the downers. They want a remake of the original shows and plot line. This show had new stuff and some refreshing plot twists. It was fun and exciting! And above all- Entertaining!","true":true}
