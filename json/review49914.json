Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You fucking GUYS!!! IT WAS PERFECTION. I'M TEARY. MY NIPPLES WERE HARD THE ENTIRE TIME. IT IS WITHOUT QUESTION THE BEST STAR WARS MOVIE EVER! I SINCERELY DON'T KNOW IF EPISODE 9 WILL BEAT IT. THERE WERE SUBTLE CALLBACKS AND REFERENCES TO EVERY STAR WARS MOVIE EXCEPT EPISODE 2 AND ROUGE ONE. THEY WERE DONE SO DIFFERENTLY AND SO PERFECT. PLOT TWISTS GALORE. I DIDNT SEE A SINGLE FUCKING THING FROM THIS MOVIE COMING. I NEED TO SEE THIS 8 MORE TIMES BEFORE ITS OUT OF THEATERS. ITS BETTER THAN EMPIRE. ITS SINGLE HANDEDLY THE BEST PIECE OF CINEMA IVE SEEN EVER IN YEARS. OMFG!! I SCREAMED. I CHEERED. THIS MOVIE MOVED ME. MY SOULS DICK IS HARD AS FUCK. IT. IS. PERFECT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","true":true}
