We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I never used metacritic\\, this account is created for this game\\, to let naughty dog know my anger. I need to announce at first that this 3 only gives to all developers who create this wonderful world and offer the impressive gameplay. Sorry I can't give them higher as it will raise the average\\, which I don't expect at all.\r\rThe reason of this low score is clear\\, the story.  I can accept Joel's death even that really broken my heart to pieces. There are many other things to complain. For Owen and Mel\\, it was them try to kill you first\\, and they nearly did it. Why did Ellie feel something like regret first but not rejoice you still alive? Then Abby came all the way to Ellie's shelter. When I expected a real fight before I cut that gorilla into pieces\\, the story turned to the side of ABBY?? Do you know how I feel when I have to control someone I want to kill and forced to keep she alive? And it kept for hours! Nearly a half of the game! I come for Ellie and Joel\\, not Abby!\r\rI skipped all CG of this Abby and finally finished all her story\\, the you just told me to hunt Ellie by Abby!??? What's wrong with you! How dare you! I played that far to see Abby's death and now you want me to kill Ellie? My anger raised up for every punch from Abby!\r\rAnd the last part\\, I finally reached her and all I need is a bullet through Abby's head\\, but why Ellie put her down and let her go? She nearly drown Abby\\, but she released her after Joel flashed through her mind. What? Why? Why this? Why let her go? WHAT IS THIS GAME WASTED MY 3 DAYS!??\r\rI know I really need to calm down\\, but I just can't. I guess it's exactly what you want me to feel after I played your MASTERPIECE. Now take my revenge\\, naughty DOG.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
