Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It has bad and lazy writing.  Disney can only can trick us the fans to watch it once and no more. There is too much wrong with film and try to cover up with cool visual effects. Audience are sick of this type of film.","true":true}
