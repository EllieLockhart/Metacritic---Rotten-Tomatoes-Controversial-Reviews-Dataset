Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Completely pointless subplots. So many things were completely out of left field and had everyone around me in the theater scratching their heads. Every time the movie starts to go in a really cool direction it puts an end to it real quick and makes it as boring as possible. Terrible script. Only good thing are the performances of the cast and production value of the movie.","true":true}
