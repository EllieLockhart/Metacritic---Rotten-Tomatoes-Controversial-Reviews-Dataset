Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A rather underwhelming continuation to Episode 7 in the Star Wars saga. SPOILER ALERT: \\n \\nSnoke was annoyingly killed off by Kylo Ren in the second act and was a total waste of a potentially awesome character and villain in this movie. \\n \\nI also feel that the plot dragged on\\, none of the jokes were particularly funny\\, and the films climax was rather underwhelming. Just when you think Luke is about to engage in a potentially awesome fight to the death with Kylo Ren\\, the film b*tch slaps you in the face when it reveals that he was just a mere hologram and that his real self annoyingly fades away and dies (along with my hopes for this movie being good) on a deserted island minutes later. Not a very good finish for someone who was an awesome hero in the original trilogy in my honest opinion. \\n \\nOverall this movie does have some qualities\\, e.g. it is a visually stunning film and has some good performances from the cast\\, particularly Mark Hamill (even though his character wasn't done much justice). This film is also ok as an action movie of which I feel you can take your kids to but when push comes to shove\\, I just don't feel this movie will hold out well as big opportunities were missed here.","true":true}
