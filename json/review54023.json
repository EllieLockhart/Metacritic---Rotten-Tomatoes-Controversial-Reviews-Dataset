Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't begin to describe how amazing I thought this movie was. Everything I predicted did not happen\\, the speculations of the film by many fans online were also incorrect. The CGI was remarkable\\, the story line was comprehensible. The effort was translucent to it's viewers. As mentioned to many others\\, if you aren't a fanatic of Star Wars then you will not think this movie is at all \\\"amazing\\\" you'll quickly believe it's good or great. What stand out to me the most was that Princess Leia displayed the force\\, i thought that was remarkable. The very ending with the fight between Kylo Ren and Luke Skywalker honestly shook me\\, \\nI didn't expect it at all. I thought the movie was rather unpredictable. The last Jedi is basically the ending of the Skywalker family and the beginning of a new generation of Jedi's\\nAs Yoda says \\\"We are what they grow beyond\\\" which means the force has chosen many more & there's many other stories to come. As for now this is currently my favorite movie but Episode four a new hope will always be my #1 Star Wars Film.","true":true}
