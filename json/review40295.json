Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is\\, objectively\\, an awesome movie. The chemistry between the characters is off the charts and the action kept me on the edge of the seat. Also\\, the porgs and crystal foxes were cute AF. Excellent acting particularly from Adam\\, Daisy and Mark. \\nI have a strong feeling that most very low reviews are due to people not getting what they wanted (male heroes and a holy legend Luke). I feel for them\\, but that doesn't make this a bad movie. Go and see for yourself","true":true}
