Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"The Last Jedi\\\" artfully plays with the audience's expectations -- in both the revelations in this film\\, and in what a \\\"Star Wars\\\" movie is\\, in general -- to great effect. If you thought \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" was safe and predictable\\, then you may just love the twists of its sequel. The things you thought were going to be most important do not matter at all. \\\"This is not going to go the way you think\\,\\\" indeed.\\n\\nMark Hamill is fantastic as a reclusive\\, defeated version of Luke Skywalker\\, and Adam Driver makes the Dark Side seem seductive in a way that three prequel movies never did. \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" is a very busy movie\\, and one of the side plots is a bit rushed\/seems unnecessary -- until the very final scene of the film redeems it. This is also the most gorgeous \\\"Star Wars\\\" film yet: awash in bold\\, violent reds and unafraid of cinematography and editing tricks borrowed from anime and arthouse films.","true":true}
