Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A good stand alone movie with great acting by main characters and an interesting plot line. That being said\\, it's a horrible star wars movie. Completely takes a dump on all the Star Wars mythos that came before it with the original trilogy AND takes a dump on the direction of The Force Awakens. I was sitting there at the end thinking WTF?? And WHY???  Bottom line\\, if you're not a Star Wars fan (like my wife)\\, you'll love it. If you are a Star Wars fan (like me)\\, it will disappoint\\, especially with Luke.","true":true}
