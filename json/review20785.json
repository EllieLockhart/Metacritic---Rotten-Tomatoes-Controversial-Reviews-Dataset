Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to love it\\, as did most of us but I couldn't get past the huge plot holes throughout\\, pointless plotlines used to forward a political agenda\\, and Luke's essentially evil character. The only good storyline was Rey\/Kylo's. Yoda was an abomination. I can't forgive them for the way they dessecrated these classic characters and I'm only 18. This movie is what happens when your replace good storytelling with propaganda and forced meaning.","true":true}
