Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi was absolutely terrible. It was the worst Star Wars movie ever. I'm what would be considered a super fan. I vehemently defend the prequels! I know they have their short comings and awful scenes\\, poor acting and cheesiness\\, but they still feel like Star Wars and perfectly fill in the story before the originals. Revenge of the Sith\\, I feel is one of the most important movies in the saga! I thought the Force awakens was a good enough job to start a new trilogy. I felt it was quite a bit rushed and too many things crammed in\\, a bit silly\\, but overall fine. I thought Rogue One was the best Star Wars since the originals\\, but dammit if this new one isn't just awful. There were no high stakes. It was all slap stick children comedy. It felt like laser tag in space with wizards and the story line was so dull and too convenient. Not to mention the insulting disintegration of everything prior to this one. This movie killed my excitement for the franchise going forward.","true":true}
