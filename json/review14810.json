Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have to say I am so disappointed in this movie\\, even more than The Farce Awakens\\, we are stuck with a bad story line started by the hack JJ Abrams and will be continued by JJ\\, but at this point... with where the story ended up... I don't see how JJ can save part IX\\, this movie is a hot mess and not in a good way\\, instead of trying to shoehorn a story into an agenda  they should have tried to make a good story\\, it's not even a good one. I would prefer to re-watch the Star Wars Holiday Special again than this drivel.","true":true}
