{"101487":175901,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the last jedi was unquestionably the best star wars film to date\\, all you die hard original trilogy fanboys that just wanted them to repeat what George Lucas did 40 years ago when this all started can just go and cry in a corner. this isn't like the original and prequel trilogies which you could always tell who was main bad guy for the trilogy\\, no this took what we expected and threw it out the window. people wanted to keep this as the SKYWALKER story well you still get that or did you lot forget kylo is a skywalker\\, I for one am glad that their moving away from it being about one family of jedi. yes im sad that lukes gone and that the finale remnants of the original trilogy are all but dead now but there is so much to look forward to\\, so many great and new stories they can focus on. a better focus of rey and kylo and not about searching for skywalker or having us all wondering who is snoke like we've had the skywalkers for 40 years and they'll always be there\\, but its time for other people to take the spotlight of the movies and show what the rest of the galaxy has to offer. I personally give this a 4 1\/2 it had its flaws but so does every other star wars movie.?","true":true}
