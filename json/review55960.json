Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson took every aspect of the phenomenally successful JJ Abrams reboot and intentionally threw it out the window\\, citing the need to do something different and \\\"let the past die\\\".  What he came up with is a Marvel-esque\\, quirky romp through a galaxy far far away that did more to irreverently dismantle the franchise than build it in a unique direction.\\n\\nThis is like the successor of Elon Musk saying \\\"everyone expects Tesla to put out another electric car so this time let's do something unique and throw a gas engine in there.\\\"  Great job\\, you just threw away everything that makes your brand unique and made it like everything else on the market.  Sure\\, some people are going to like it because now they can \\\"get it\\\" but the true fans\\, the ones who have kept this franchise alive for 40 years\\, have been abandoned.\\n\\nWhat's worse is that Johnson made irreversable changes to the Star Wars story that effectively CRIPPLE any attempt to revive these components in the following movies.  So now\\, not only does this movie exist and permanently holds the position of episode 8 but it's also made it incredibly difficult for the next movie to come back from the dark side.","true":true}
