Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First of all to all of those who didn't like this movie for your verious reasons I will say that you are not wrong.  Many of the same things that many of you didn't like didn't completely work for me.  I felt some of the humor\\, even though the majority of the jokes landed for me\\, I did find some of them inappropiately placed. The Finn\/Rose subplot didn't completely work for me either.  I can also see where the hardcore Star Wars lore fans that read all the books\\, comics\\, and gamers are having a difficult time with it because there are points where the characterd are not always acting like you would expect or like them to.  On the flip side I didn't let those few moments ruin the entire movie either.\\n     Inspite of this movie's little issues here and there I found it highly entertaining\\, was I entertained is my highest criteria for any rating I give a movie\\, and overall alot of fun and exciting to watch. Overall a great time at the movies.","true":true}
