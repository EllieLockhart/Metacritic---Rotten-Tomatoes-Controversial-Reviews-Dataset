Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An insult to Star Wars. Full of plot holes. Disrupts established lore and logic.\\nUseless charaters. Terrible humor. And even a sex joke.\\nCharacters do things completely out of place in a StarWars film.\\n\\nDoubt the writers ever watched a Star Wars film before.\\n\\nNot even a lightsaber fight... in a Star Wars film!? \\n\\nPlease get back on track with episode 9 and the Solo film.","true":true}
