Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful\\nTurns out all the Rebels ever needed were a few ships willing to go into hyperspace to take out any Star Destroyer or Death Star....talk about Deus Ex Machina.\\nDisney has taken The Force\\, and like they inevitably do with anything truly cool\\, turned it into a commodity.\\nNo dignity\\,  no subtlety anf no mystery.\\nSpiritual Materialism alive and well.\\nMind you the whole franchise was already shot. The fact we turn up with any hope left at all is down to Joseph Cambell and the mythic foundation he laid with the first two movies....now the archetypal structure lies in ruins...we are truly in the Wasteland. \\nAvoid!","true":true}
