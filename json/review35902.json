Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is the unequivocal evidence that politics\\, cinematography\\, and visual effects are paramount in the eyes of \\\"professional\\\" critics\\, while story and integrity reign supreme in the eyes of fans.  This film lacked vision and direction.  To top it off the mafia style approach Lucas Films has taken toward fans and even cast members who recognize the bias and inneptness of the film seems to have divided the base in such a way that it may not recover until a changing of the guard.","true":true}
