Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I'm not critical or anything\\, so I'll be very straightforward in my analysis. The Last of Us Part 2 is one of the best games I've played in recent times\\, the level of detail in the animations\\, facial expressions\\, graphics and history is impressive!

The amount of detail sometimes borders on perfection\\, facial expressions and animations deserve to be highlighted here\\, I didn't believe it when I saw some things happening. About the story I will not comment much to not give spoilers\\, but one thing that does not make sense to me is the clueless criticism they are making\\, saying that the game is bad because of a detail in the story that did not please\\, it seems joke. The Last of Us Part 2 has a super heavy story involving revenge\\, it is much heavier than the first and is far from being a bad story\\, in fact it is great and the characters are also. His story was not made to please\\, it was made to be good and to mess with the player. You will feel anguish\\, anger\\, fear and a lot of emotions at the same time\\, it is inexplicable what they managed to make me feel while playing. If you like happy stories and get irritated when \\\"tragedies\\\" happen in stories\\, then stay away from this game\\, because as I said it was not meant to please but to mess with you.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
