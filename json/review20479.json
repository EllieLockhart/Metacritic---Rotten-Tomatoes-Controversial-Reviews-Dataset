Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a Star Wars fan for over 25 years\\, I grew up watching these movies and I don't understand all of the hate this film is getting. Rian Johnson did an amazing job. I can acknowledge it has its flaws and isn't perfect\\, but what movie is? None of the originals were\\, and certainly not the prequels. It was a very well directed film with great acting that took the story in a very compelling and unexpected direction. I love the character arcs\\, especially Luke\\, Rey and Kylo. And the soundtrack\\, John Williams.... 'nuff said. After a second viewing the thing I'm most disappointed about is that I have to wait two years to see how it all ends. ","true":true}
