Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am really shocked by how angry people are about The Last Jedi. This movie took a lot of chances (nearly all of them were successful). TLJ expanded the mythology\\, added new and interesting characters\\, and provided a new perspective on the force. Rey and Kylo's story is gonna be bonkers in Episode 9. I hope everyone gives it a second chance...","true":true}
