Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful movie  -I just can't recommend such an awful story and direction. The entire plot was stolen by George Lucas and the Clone Wars cartoon. Don't believe me? Look it up on Netflix.","true":true}
