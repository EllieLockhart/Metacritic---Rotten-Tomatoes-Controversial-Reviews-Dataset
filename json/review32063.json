Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS !!\\n\\nI didn't like it the first time I saw it.  Second time I went\\, I took my kids and saw how much they enjoyed it.  Finally\\, saw it one more time and now I actually love the film.\\n\\nHere's the thing I think for most of us who were fans of the original trilogy: it is no longer our Star Wars.  This can be a hard thing to let go of.  \\n\\nIt's pretty obvious Star Wars will move focus away from the Skywalker lineage to open it up to changing the mythology around new force sensitive characters ... btw which I believe will specifically be orphan kids (Anakin\\, Luke\\, Rey).  Older generations like me may find this blasphemous but it only makes sense.  How long can any franchise keep up an ongoing story where the flagship movie has to always follow a single lineage?  This isn't like a superhero film where you can just reboot every few years with the same character.  Think about 10 to 20 years from now\\, how played out will the Skywalker plot be?   How many times can somebody figure out the person they're talking to is their long lost immediately relative?  Seriously think about it.  \\n\\nThis was the thing that made me realize this is probably the most consequential Star Wars film for setting up all other films for the main Star Wars and spinoffs.  People might hate this but I'm okay with it.  Why?\\n\\nSpeaking as a parent\\, there's an ironic parallel of what's happening in Star Wars in terms of passing on the force to Rey\\, just like as parents we're trying to pass down our Star Wars fandom to our kids.  I personally hope I will be in my very old age watching new Star Wars films with my future grandchildren.  In order for that to happen though\\, moving away from the Skywalkers right now was they thing they had to do.  \\n\\nI can tell all of you despite my kids loving the original trilogy\\, none of them were sad or disappointed that Rey wasn't related to anyone or that Luke didn't have this epic hero story focused on him.  \\n\\nI can tell you that all of them thought the last scene of the boy using the force to get his broom was very cool and the idea that there could be a new army of young Jedi is what they're looking forward to.\\n\\nLast\\, I do think it's hard for older generations to know going into these films not only is it likely your past heroes are going to die on the screen\\, they are dying in real life (Carrie Fisher).   There isn't a franchise like Star Wars where we are witnessing characters move on in an epic story as the fanbase is also aging with it.  Likewise\\, there is always a sense of nostalgia initially especially with Force Awakens\\, but now with this film a sense of mortality that can be somewhat hard to swallow for older generations.  When I first saw the film with my wife\\, all I thought about was Luke dying in the end and the end of the Skywalkers.  When I took my kids though\\, what they saw was the ascension of Rey and they're right\\, this is her story and her time\\, independent of the past.","true":true}
