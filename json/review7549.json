{"101487":118894,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everyone tends to focus on missed expectations here. That's not even the Last Jedi's biggest flaw; It suffers from a poorly developed story and subplots. Rian Johnson needed another writer to help him with this one. Also an overabundance of twists and shocks just for shocks sake. Bad decisions all around.","true":true}
