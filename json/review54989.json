Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was exciting in the theater\\, but as soon as I walked out\\, I started noticing everything wrong with it. The Last Jedi is the only Star Wars movie I don't own on DVD\\, for the simple fact that I have no desire to watch it again. That alone means that it has failed every movie's basic purpose\\, to entertain. I've lost count of how many times I've watched the original trilogy and the prequels. The fact that I have no desire to rewatch TLJ means it has not only failed as a movie\\, but as a Star Wars movie. I could continue beating the dead horse and explain everything wrong with the movie\\, but chances are\\, if you're of the same mindset I am\\, you've already filled your YouTube recommendations with videos that do just that. Rey is uninteresting  and a literal god that can do no wrong and has access to every force power imaginable\\, sometimes making up new ones\\, because\\, hey\\, she's a woman. All with no training whatsoever. Meanwhile\\, Kylo Ren was trained by Luke Skywalker himself for years and then trained my Snoke\\, who turns out to be nobody\\, like Rey's parents. And somehow\\, he loses to the girl with no lightsaber or force training. Yeah\\, this movie will subvert your expectations alright. You were expecting a good movie\\, but you got this instead.","true":true}
