{"101487":133745,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-25","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have mixed reactions after viewing Star Wars: The Last Jedi a couple of times before writing this review; I felt the movie was visually great but disrespected the saga that we come to love since the beginning. Let me start with the positive notes\\, for me The Last Jedi has been the most explosive and visually entertaining Star Wars movie that I have watched\\, from the opening scene\\, the visual contrasts of the lighting and the color choices have served the movie well since it gave you this \\\"awe\\\" factor. Another positive side of the movie was good attempt to make the saga move forward and to make some characters grow; I loved how it made Kylo's character grew to a certain extent that he was no longer a kid that  long for acceptance; now he firmly chose what he wants to be in galaxy. \\n\\nNow\\, there are several things that I hated about how the movie progressed\\, first it is anti-masculine; I have nothing against women but seeing this movie makes me wonder why all the men in this movie with the exception of Kylo\\, was portrayed like a ignorant dude\\, Finn is still the reckless and cowardice guy who tried to escape again from the fire fight\\, then the character of Poe was demoted and kept in the dark and then Luke is a hopeless hermit that just wanted to die. Second\\, I feel the plot twists are absurd\\, Poe was demoted and later General Holdo kept Poe in the dark about her plans to go planet Crait thus lead to an unnecessary series of events where Finn and Rose going to Canto Bight and also Poe staging a mutiny; why keep it a secret when you could have just told Poe about your plans\\, maybe he could have pitched in some ideas of his own. Also\\, the death of Snoke was a letdown given that he is a very powerful force user and a master manipulator yet he got chopped in half by Kylo without him realizing it... Seriously? All those mind tricks using the Force and he can't see a low blow? \\n\\nLastly and what I hated about the movie the most is the way it portrayed Luke's character\\, in the original trilogy\\, Luke was this very hopeful\\, optimistic and courageous guy that we have ever seen but this movie we saw a Luke that is opposite of his persona. Luke was portrayed like a guy that lost all hope in the universe and just wanted to die\\, being trained as a Jedi before\\, quitting  was never an option and failure was never a hindrance for him\\, even in the time he was to face Darth Vader with his incomplete training. I also\\, can't believe that they even considered portraying that Luke tried to kill Kylo because he senses he was falling to the dark side\\, Luke didn't even consider killing Darth Vader\\, his father\\,  who was even more evil and sinister than Kylo.  I feel the movie just wanted to kill Luke's character\\, I would have accepted his death if it was done in a more grand and redemptive manner like for example he lifted that X-Wing from the waters and physically came to Crait to help his sister Leia and fighting Kylo physically in a laser sword battle and then disappearing like Obi Wan; or he may have passed like Yoda during a redemptive scene with Rey as his student and Luke as the teacher. Yet\\, the movie just did a virtual battle with Kylo\\, admittedly it was very cool to see\\, but I find very uncharacteristic of Luke and the essence of being a Jedi.\\n\\nOverall\\, the movie just wanted the past to die no matter what it takes without considering any value for the Star Wars saga\\, it's just like saying that you are dead because I just like you to be dead\\, plain and simple.","true":true}
