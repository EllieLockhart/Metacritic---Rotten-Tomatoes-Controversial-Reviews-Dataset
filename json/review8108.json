Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic film overall. Maybe some minor problems with pacing\\, but enough intensity lightened by comedic moments to keep me interested to the end. Kickass scenes with original characters and with the new crew alike. Tributes to all three original films embedded all throughout\\, but really a mash of Empire and Return of the Jedi. Loved it!","true":true}
