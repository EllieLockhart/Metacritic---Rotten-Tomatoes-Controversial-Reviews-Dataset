Sadly its a shame how the Devs treat their old established Characters\\, it\rfeels like a kick in the balls to the fans and a cheap way to set up the weak plot\r(Disney Luke Skywalker is an easily drawn comparison) and all new Characters are\rvery unlikable.\r\r-Gameplay 5\/10: The weakest point in The Last Of Us was always the Gameplay. Sure some ppl like\rit\\, but its avarage at best and pretty boring. TLOU2 doesnt innovate here\\, but\rimproves the established System a little bit\\, with some decent quality of life\rchanges.\r\r-Graphics 9\/10: Not much to say here\\, the Game looks insanly good. Only negative is the frame-rate.\rPpl should wait till the PS5 release to get the optimal experience out of it.\r\r-Level design 2\/10: Holy **** are these Levels \\\"just there\\\". They look beautiful and all\\, but are so empty\rthey are very linear with almost no 2nd path or something to explore. Even some\rCall of Duty Levels are more interesting.\r-AI 4\/10: Improved but very dated\\, feels like Im playing a stealth game from 2014.\r\rFazit: I would give the Game a 4\/10\\, from a technical point the Game is solid\\, but the Gameplay and Levels leave much to be desired and are never the selling point of the Game. What remains is the story which can in some way be interpreted as an attack to the fanbase (yes its that bad and the leaks were 100% accurate). So I would only suggest this Game to the few people who liked the 1st Game not for the story\\, but for the Gameplay.\r\redit: I'm shocked and disgusted that Naughty Dog and Sony managed to pay this Game up to the rating of a Zelda Breath of the Wild. Shame on you\\, shame on the industry and corrupt press\\, Im actually speechless and disappointed.\r~changed rating from 4\/10 to 0\/10.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
