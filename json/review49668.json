Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow\\, what a dumpster fire. This is the worst Star Wars since Attack of the Clones. There are so many just dumb decisions in this movie. Dumb lines\\, dumb plot holes\\, dumb wastes of good characters and unnecessary insertions of others. I would have been laughing at how bad this movie was if it had't been crushing my hopes and dreams for the franchise. Someone please fire Rian Johnson from the new trilogy immediately.","true":true}
