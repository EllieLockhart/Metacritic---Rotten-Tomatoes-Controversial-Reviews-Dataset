Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a nightmare; an insult to the magnificent universe George Lucas created.  It attenpted to poison the legacy of the greatest hero in the history of science fiction and if you really think about the plot\\, the movie ended exactly where it started.  No development\\, one less hero in the universe\\, and a lot of wasted opportunities.","true":true}
