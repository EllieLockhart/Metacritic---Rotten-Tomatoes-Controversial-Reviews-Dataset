Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't like the movie that much. Star War fans have been waiting for two years to see this with anticipation of big reveals. There was nothing. Plus what they did with Luke at the end was terrible. No wonder Mark Hamil was upset in the beginning. I'm mean it's a have to see if your a fan. But I won't be paying for a second view.","true":true}
