Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was one of the best movies I have ever seen. The meta commentary in this film with quotes like \\\"this is not going to go how you think\\\" is amazing. Jokes amazing. Sound design superb. Leia amazing. Rey\\, Kylo\\, and snokes interactions definitely solidified who is evil and is one of the best I have seen in cinema by far. Mark Hamill should get and Oscar. Oscar Isaac also gave an amazing performance. The explanation of war themes were intriguing. Space ships where pretty awesome too. Porgs and Chewy just made my night. Roses arc was smaller but helped connect me in a personal way. The creature design was great and glad to see practical effects used in many cases.","true":true}
