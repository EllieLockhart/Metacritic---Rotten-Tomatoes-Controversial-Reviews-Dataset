Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Slow\\, dull\\, uninspiring\\, overly politicised\\, chaotic story telling with no real meaning and several long scenes that felt like filler\\, which ultimately made no difference at all to the overall plot.\\n\\nThe humour is cringey\\, and destroys that willing suspension of disbelief. The overall theme of the movie really seemed to be about dashing the meaning and importance of all previous films in the series\\, including episode 7\\, with several much-anticipated plot points being played down or entirely abandoned. \\n\\nMost characters were unlikable and superficial\\, I really couldn't empathise with any character and this made it even more difficult for me to invest in what is\\, to put it bluntly\\, a poorly written and produced corporate cash-grab.","true":true}
