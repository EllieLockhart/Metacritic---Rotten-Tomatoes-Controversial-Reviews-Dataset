Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I only gave this one star because RT doesn't count 1\/2 or no-star ratings towards the average. This film is a deliberate desecration of the Star Wars franchise. The makers of this film not only hate Star Wars; they hate heroes\\, they hate hope\\, and they hate everything our culture has built. But I still have my Original Series DVDs\\, and no one can take them away from me.","true":true}
