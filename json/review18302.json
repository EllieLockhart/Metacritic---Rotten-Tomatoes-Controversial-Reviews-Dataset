Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought the Storyline was awesome\\, but the \\\"Avengers\\\" style sarcastic humor does not fit this series. This was not Luke Skywalker\\, ruined the character and was very confusing about his personality at many times. RIP Carrie\\, but they should have figured a better way for her to go out in style. The fact that now she will just be wiped away from the series in gold scrolling text is very sad and doesn't extend to what she brought to the series.","true":true}
