Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The graphics are the best there are but that's it. The gameplay feels clunky just like the first one. It's almost no different than the first one\\, barely any improvement in this section. Soundtrack is on par just like the predecessor and the acting is good but the dialogue feels forced. And the elephant in the room\\, the story. From the first two hours we see a shift in Ellie\\, Joel and Tommy\\, as if they are not the same characters that were before. Having Joel die so early on and with such meaningless is very disrespectful to the character and it does nothing else than to shock the audience. Then forcing to play as Abby. That character feels forced into the story\\, trying to empathise with her but all it does is taking away the interest of the player in going forward into the story. Lastly the ending. We are forced to go on a path of revenge as Ellie for almost 25 hours only to kill everyone that had less to do with Joel's death but the story leaves the killer get away with the murder and leave the main protagonist with nothing. The story doesn't satisfy the players at all and all it does is leaving us betrayed and disappointed for struggling to rech the end of the tale. For a story driven game it fails in comparison with the first The Last of Us and if the story doesn't clicks\\, then it's hard to enjoy it especially that the gameplay is outdated.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
