Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible. Rian Johnson did a horrible job with this movie. I am such a big star wars fan and I feel like 1-7 are the true movies. Typical Hollywood bullcrap just jacking up the reviews so people will go spend money and see it. This just means I will NEVER go see the new Han Solo movie or episode 9 till it comes on redbox. \\n\\nWhat is this new jedi ability to be somewhere you aren't? SO many unanswered questions. Terrible job directing. We need JJ back. Force awakens was so good and this is such trash. Hollywood is a JOKE.","true":true}
