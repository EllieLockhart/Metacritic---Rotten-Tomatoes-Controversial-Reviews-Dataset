Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a long time Star Wars fan\\, I was disappointed.\\n\\nAlthough Force Awakens wasn't my favorite movie\\, I felt that JJ Abrams did a fantastic job setting up this new franchise.  \\n\\nI left feeling that age-old heroes had been misused while newer characters like Snoke and Phasma were underutilized.  \\n\\nAlso\\, misplaced humor was a sore spot for me. Historically\\, Star Wars has had great comedic timing... This was too much.\\n\\nI'm no expert movie reviewer but I know this doesn't deserve a top remarks in terms of great films.","true":true}
