Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left feeling disappointed. I didn't walk in with expectations\\, but the movie had a plot that didn't make sense\\, and ruined the character of Luke Skywalker. Awful awful movie and I will absolutely not see episode 9 in the movie theater.","true":true}
