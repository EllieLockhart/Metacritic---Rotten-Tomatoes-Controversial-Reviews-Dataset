Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a long\\, long time fan of Star Wars\\, I will say\\, it was brilliant. It reminded me fondly of many of the dark twists and character development in the Knights of the Old Republic series. Spended grandiose story\\, in which nothing is safe\\, or sacred. It is the birth of a new generation of heroes and villains\\, as the step from the shadows of the giants before them.","true":true}
