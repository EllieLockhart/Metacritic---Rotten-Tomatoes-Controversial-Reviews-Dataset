{"101487":121911,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For your average everyday movie\\, you could say the Last Jedi is an okay watch however\\, this movie is heavily destructive as part of the Star Wars Saga. The Last Jedi has absolutely no links with the Force Awakens (which I loved 5\/5) making it clear there was a change of director as previous expectations are quickly shot down. Events happen in this movie which conflict with previous Star Wars knowledge and therefore make no sense. The storyline with Fin and Rose is pointless displaying messages of animal cruelty. Animal cruelty has always been a part of the Star Wars world and no one has ever cared\\, like when Luke killed that Tauntaun at the beginning of Episode V on Hoth.\\n\\nSPOILERS\\nRey's parents are nobodies making the Force Awakens pointless - why did Anakin's Lightsaber call to her in the Force Awakens?\\, Leia is Superman\\, Snoke and Captain Phasma die with no effort making their characters and the Force Awakens pointless\\, Luke is a coward - why did he even leave a map if he didn't want to fight for the Rebels?\\, the BB8 droid may as well become a Jedi with its heroics\\, light speed kamikaze attacks are now possible despite being told otherwise in previous episodes\\, Fin and Rose's storyline is boring\\, pointless and childish.
