Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is in some parts absolutly grat. It's suprises you\\, it catches you\\, brings old memories\\, great performance by the actors and of course a great score. \\nBut there are also many negativ points. The first half of the film is not importan at all. You could easely cut it out and the movie would have been shorter. There are some decisions on some characters\\, which are destroying our image of them and most of the new characters don't fit in the film as they did in 7.","true":true}
