Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Is this movie Episode 1 level bad\\, no\\, but its the potential of what it could \\nof been that is so heartbreaking.  Rian is a creative genius who directed probably the most emotional one hour of drama in television history. Surrounded by him is a production team of some of the most creative\\, imaginative story tellers in Hollywood\\, who live\\, breath and sleep Star Wars\\, making up the Lucas Film Story Group. You know for a fact at one point these core individuals\\, sat around a table and came up with dozens if not hundreds of different plot lines and ideas for character development that could of taken this movie into so many unexpected and wonderful directions. Rey's lineage for example. **Spoilers**  You know they passed around the idea of making her a Skywalker\\, a Kenobi\\, a Solo\\, Ben's twin sister\\, a child born of the force a la Anakin\\, perhaps by a recluse Plageuis\\, or maybe a Palpatine heir apparent put into hiding decades ago. So many choices.  Fast forward two years later and here we are\\, after years in the making\\, thousands of hours of production time\\, we find ourselves under the island. Its cold. Rey looks into the mirror\\, oh my god\\, this is it\\, were going to learn of Rey's lineage\\, and we know the news isnt good\\, the dark side of the force is all around us\\, the music\\, the setting\\, we're at the edge of our seat\\, the vision in the mirror we see it\\, we can't make it out\\, it slowly unblurs\\, we all collectively hold our breath and then we see it\\, the face of Sheev Palpatine. Wow! The audience gasps\\, Rey is in disbelief\\, how is this possible\\, she drops to her knees\\, how will she continue down this path knowing her true bloodline is that of a Sith Lord\\, the internal conflict\\, the mixed emotions\\, how will she tell Luc\\, maybe Luc already knows and thats why hes reluctant to train her\\, is his failure with Ben just an excuse\\, will Luc's own bloodline being the Jedi son of a Sith Lord play any part\\, maybe this is a path to redemption\\, a way for Luc to regain his faith he has long since lost\\, catharsis. So many questions\\, so many layers..... But no\\, the vision appears to us and its Rey\\, a nobody\\, the daughter of homeless space junkies\\, who sold their daughter to the highest bidder for their next fix.  This is what the most creative minds in science fiction came up with.  The backlash isnt the product of fan boys like me not getting their way\\, its the result of someone like me who lives in his mother's basement being able to come up with a storyline\\, with more depth\\, more layers and more emotion than that of a billion dollar production company.  Thats why this movie has 56%.","true":true}
