Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Upon my first viewing I was upset and angry as a lifetime Star Wars fan. The theatre I was in laughed at everything. Bad seats and a  fat guy next to me was a perfect combination for me not being in a good mood coming out of the theatre. As a film enthusiast I saw the amazing directing and acting and cinematography. The Star Wars fan and me overpowered the film lover in me and saw the negatives and the turns away from the previously set up movie. Upon my second viewing I loved this film it deserves to be watched and besides the original trilogy it is easily the best Star Wars film. The characters develop beautifuly and Adam driver was AMAZING. All of this to say see it twice if you didn't like it. You'll pick up things you didn't see and just try to enjoy a Star Wars movie that breaks barriers which is what is needed when so many of these are coming out. May the force be with you.","true":true}
