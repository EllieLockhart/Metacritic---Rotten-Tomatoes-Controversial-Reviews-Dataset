Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was shocked by the film\\, to a point where I had to collect my thoughts\\, and go see it again.  Unfortunately\\, my problems with the film were only affirmed. Regarding Snoke\\, Luke and even other characters including Finn and Rose\\, I feel that so many great opportunities to do these characters justice was squandered only to leave confusion and anger in long term fans of the series. Phasma was under utilized as well. Animals received more screentime than some of the major characters involved. I honestly hope that Ryan Johnson removes himself or gets removed from any content related to Star Wars since his attempt to do justice to the saga was to alienate fans by dead end plots and no meaningful story throughout.  Almost no questions are answered in the film that The Force Awakens got us excited to have answered.  It doesn't advance the story in a direction we would like to see but leaves gaping wounds only J.J. Abrams will be hard pressed to close.","true":true}
