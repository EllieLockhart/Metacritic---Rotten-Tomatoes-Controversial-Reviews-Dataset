Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While there are great moments in it\\, I wouldn't consider episode VIII great as a stand alone movie\\, nor as a continuation of the SW franchise. With the exception of Luke\\, Rey and Kylo's storylines\\, the film fails to do much of anything with the side characters we came to know and love in VII. Adam Driver gives a standout performance as the conflicted Ben Solo\\, and his backstory with Luke and unique connection to Rey is the most engaging aspect of the entire movie. It isn't the attempt to subvert expectation that fails this movie so much as its pacing issues\\, cringey dialogue and inconsistent characterization.","true":true}
