Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a Star Wars fan since I was a little kid. My first memory of any movie is watching The Empire Strikes Back. I was excited after The Force Awakens to see this new reincarnation of Star Wars. I watched all the Youtube videos (Star Wars explains\\, Collider Jedi Council and Star Wars Theory) I read all the theory articles and started to make my own headcanon of what The Last Jedi would be and who the characters would be. This movie was none of those things. At the moment of walking out of the movie\\, I was extremely disappointed I didn't hate it was just disappointed. After several days of thinking about the movie\\, discussing it with friends and a second viewing I realize my disappointment was not in the movie but that they didn't use my headcanon theories. This is a very good installment of Star Wars it really uses a different lens to view Star Wars much like Rouge One. I am excited to see where J.J. ends this trilogy and where the franchise goes from here. I appreciate what Rian Johnson did with this movie and I am excited to see the trilogy he has been entrusted with in the franchise. It is not a movie without problems. There are definitely parts of the movie I rolled my eyes but on the whole\\, it was a solid installment. When viewing this movie go with zero expectaion or theroies and you will theroghly enjoy this movie.","true":true}
