Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ruined the franchise for me. Butchered Luke's character. I'm just appalled at what I saw.","true":true}
