Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't rate this movie low enough. Disney has destroyed my enjoyment of anything Star Wars.  They have turned it into a blatant money grab\\, from the horrible movies to the horrible games.\\nThe original\\, theatrical versions of the first three films are what are great about the fiction.  Unfortunately\\, it appears that it will always be limited to those three films.  I have no more interest in viewing any future films.  \\nThanks to Lucas and Disney\\, I simply don't care about the franchise anymore.","true":true}
