Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a huge SW fan\\, so writing this brief review is painful.\\n\\nin Ep VII\\, Han tells Finn 'That's not how the force work's! Well someone should have explained that to RJ!\\n\\nMajor Spoliers below:\\n\\n_____________________\u00e2?\u00ac_____________\\nLeia in space. Worst scene ever! What were they thinking!\\n\\nSnoke. Turns out to be the most useless bad guy ever\\, no answers to him or what He was. What's the point?\\n\\nLuke. Out of character and ruined him for me despite Hammils best efforts. The ending of His ark was also totally wasted.\\n\\nForce powers are ridiculous.  Why did the Jedi ever communicate with hologram if they can be omnipresent!?\\n\\nThe plot. It's a mess. Some scenes\\, especially in the Casino are actually pointless and not relevant to the story and felt like a separate mini film.\\n\\nExposition! I don't remember in Jedi hearing 3 different versions of the cast explaining how they were going to recur Han. Well that's what you get here. The characters only seem to talk to explain to the audience what's going on or what they're about to do.\\n\\nGutted. They're are some amazing scenes in this film and at times it is really good but its fundamentally flawed!","true":true}
