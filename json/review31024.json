Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So far the worst star wars movie to date. Cringe worthy humor\\, poorly written plot\\, unnecessary action\\, and full of SJW propaganda. The only thing good about this film was the interactions between Rey and Kylo Ren. Unbelievable. You've lost my trust Disney.","true":true}
