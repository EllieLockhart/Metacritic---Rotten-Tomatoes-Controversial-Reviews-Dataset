Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was amazing. It seems like a lot of people who did not like it didn't understand parts of it. It also did not live up the expectation they built up in their heads for the last two years.\\n\\nThe movie was different than any Star Wars movie before it and was amazing.","true":true}
