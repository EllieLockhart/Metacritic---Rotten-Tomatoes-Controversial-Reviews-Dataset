Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I no longer trust the Movie Critics. They pander to the big studios and don't care about the general public. Movie was terrible and smashed the story line trying to turn the story into some sort of strange mess\\, and what a f**ken mess it is now. I would normally go and see these movies 2-3 times and then purchase the DVD\\, not this movie one was to many times.","true":true}
