Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many bad choices by the director. Making the the First Order look inept from the start signals that this movie cares more about a quick laugh than telling a Star Wars story. BTW\\, the opening scene with Poe was cringeworthy. The plot was weak\\, the bad guys were weak\\, and the characters were just not compelling.","true":true}
