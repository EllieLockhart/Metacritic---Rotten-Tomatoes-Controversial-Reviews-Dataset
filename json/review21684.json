Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just a mess. The argument that Star Wars fans are never happy (not happy cause JJ played it safe & not happy cause RJ took chances) is illogical. JJ has a 89% fan approval & TLJ is substantially lower. Three things (spoilers): 1) Luke milks an alien then drinks milk in awkward scene 2) Leia Flys in space like Marry Poppins (laughable) 3) casino story with CGI slap stick reminiscent of Jar Jar getting lips zapped by pod racer engine lighting.
