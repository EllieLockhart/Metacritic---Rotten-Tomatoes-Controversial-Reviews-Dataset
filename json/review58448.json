Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A little bit of a mess. Like many Star Wars fans I have waiting in anticipation for this movie for 2 years. Hoping it will be able to keep up the pace set by the force awakens but by the time I was half way threw the movie I found myself doing something I don\u2019t usually do\\, checking my watch to see how long was left. The 152 minute run time was definitely to long\\, not to mention the fact they tried to cram what felt like a plot for every character on screen. If the movie had focused on its biggest plots\\, rebels vs first order and Rey with Luke I\u2019m sure the movie would have been shorter and somewhat better but it didn\u2019t. The acting was at some points very wooden and unbelievable. Credits go to Laura Dern\\, Carrie Fisher\\, Mark Hamill\\, Oscar isaacs and Adam Driver who seemed to really put their emotions into all of their scenes. Nostalgia was also present even if a little brief and product placement for the Star Wars Toys came in the shape of the somewhat comical porgs. A decent movie but definitely not the best in the series by far ","true":true}
