Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I grew up watching the original Star Wars movies as a kid when they actually came out.   I actually think this movie does live up to the expectations of a great movie like the original three.  I also thought it was way better than the last movie \\\"Star Wars\\, The Force Awakens\\\".  Don't listen to the negative opinions of the critics.  This movie is really good\\, packed with action\\, and laughs.","true":true}
