Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is about instilling hope. Watching the heroes fall and rise back up again\\, watch the characters question their own motives and actions. This movie is a masterpiece and I'm not sure what people don't see in this movie so much so that it has a 56% rating on RT. Wow what has this world become.","true":true}
