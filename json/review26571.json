Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Oh my gosh. The whole movie was visually stunning but the creators really outdone themselves when it comes to animals. They were simply breathtaking. The landscape of the final battle blew my mind. The red colors were so rich and beautifully making up the landscape. The plot somewhat feels as a repetition or flash back to famous twins but really keeps you guessing until the end and makes you wonder what\u2019s next? With that episode it feels like the past is sort of staying in the past and new adventures will unfold in the far far away galaxy for us to watch again \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude09","true":true}
