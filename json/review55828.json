Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pouco reconhecido\\, esse filme \u00e9 um espet\u00e1culo visual e emocionalmente deslumbrante que explora e evolui os personagens desta saga\\, possui significados de crescimento e evolu\u00e7\u00e3o em todas as suas cenas\\, explora este universo incr\u00edvel\\, e\\, o mais importante de todos\\, olha para o futuro!","true":false}
