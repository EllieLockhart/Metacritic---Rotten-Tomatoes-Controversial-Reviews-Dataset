{"101487":194320,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"We all know by now that the poor aggregate is owed largely to political trolling\\, but I'm saddened that so many jumped on the bandwagon. Virtually every acquaintance with a modicum of sense likes this film\\, making me wonder what on earth happened to the rest of you. The misogynistic comments in particular are dismaying\\, but I'm also worried about the people who expected these movies to change their lives. At least I get a laugh from those who criticize the script and acting - have you seen the original trilogy?!\\n\\nThat said\\, there are criticism to make. Mine include the handling of Luke's backstory with Ben Solo. In this case\\, a little too much is missing from the story to justify his actions\\, leaving us wondering if the complete story will ever be told. But before we cry fowl (or 'betrayal of the Star Wars mythology') recall that this has happened before. \\\"From a certain point of view\\\" was only revealed as a lie in retrospect. In fact\\, most of the criticisms that point to character inconsistencies\\, plot holes\\, poor script\\, were exemplarized in the original trilogy.\\n\\nSo\\, perhaps we can just move on. As a sequel to The Force Awakens\\, this does quite well. It doesn't develop every character - some early potential has yet to pay off\\, and there were some surprises\\, but let's see what happens. I think Johnson did provide a worthwhile plot\\, stunning visuals\\, some good new characters and a number of iconic moments. In particular\\, the Praetorian Guard sequence was stunning. We also got to see what happens when someone fails to 'calculate the jump to hyperspace'\\, and to glorious effect. Personally\\, I enjoyed the tantalizing Rey-Kylo dynamic and was quite moved by Luke's Obi-Wan style dissolution into the Force. His projected presence into the final battle was an excellent\\, original idea.\\n\\nTo me\\, the critics got it right\\, and those who didn't like The Last Jedi may just be guilty of living a long\\, long time ago. The 80s\\, to be specific. If only they could finally get out of mom's basement and find some perspective. Doubt Disney will lose any sleep over it\\, though.","true":true}
