Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a fun film\\, I don\u2019t understand a lot of the negative reviews. Hamill\\, Ridley\\, Driver\\, Tran\\, and the late Carrie Fisher deliver stellar performances. While I loved John Boyega in The Force Awakens\\, I feel there was something missing from him in this film. The effects of course are wonderful and The Action is great. The film does feel very odd in the beginning but it finds its stride as it moves along. But I think this is right up there with all the other Star Wars greats. But seriously am I the only one who likes it?","true":true}
