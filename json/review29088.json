Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really not a good movie.  If you got rid of the Star Wars legacy and judged it strictly as a stand-alone storytelling it would have been a direct-to-video candidate.  Good:  Special effects are nice\\, convincing.  Bad: Storyline\\, dialog\\, acting are all mediocre at best.  Some of the combat\/battle tactics were just stupid (both sides).  I really could go on and on.  It (like a lot of the Star Wars movies and culture) seems to be designed for the intellect and sensibilities of children.  I do not dislike this movie because of how it treated the Star Wars legacy or anything like that.  I'm neither a Star Wars hater or fanboy.  It just wasn't a very good movie.  I'm shocked at the +90% in tomatometer.  It deserves nothing like that.","true":true}
