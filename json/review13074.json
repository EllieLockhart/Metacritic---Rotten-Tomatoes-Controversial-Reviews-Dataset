Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know what all this negativity is about. Empire Strikes Back is my favorite but Last Jedi is still an AMAZING star wars film. The acting is some of the best and most complex we've seen in a star wars movie yet. The cinematography is nothing short of stunning in almost every scene and it's not a semi-rehash of A New Hope like Force Awakens was (which I still loved btw). Rian Johnson took it in a new direction and I think it's cool that it doesn't try to be like all the other Star wars movies\\, but it is still great. I'm not saying it is perfect\\, every film has flaws (I'm looking at you Jar Jar). But I've seen it twice now my only grief is the Finn\/Rose\/Cantobite storyline. Aside from that this film is phenomenal from start to finish. Comedy at the right moments\\, gorgeous cinematography throughout\\, emotional acting\\, and tasteful nods to the original trilogy that didn't distract from the scene or moment. The Last Jedi deserves much more praise than it is getting. I stand by my five stars.","true":true}
