Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm so saddened by what they did to Luke's character. Why did they change him from someone who always saw the best in people\\, who remained hopeful even in the worst situations to a man who hides out on a rock\\, abandons his friends and wants the Jedi to end. I thought Luke being tempted to kill Ben was a good idea and then hiding out of shame is a good idea\\, but the execution. There was no connection between Rey and Luke no common bond. He should have been a teacher to Rey to guide her like Yoda had guided him instead he just sits around and complains while Rey just does her thing and learns the Force by herself. \\n\\n Also why did the Jedi have to end\\, but because the PT Jedi failed. The Jedi kept the peace for a thousand years were they always corrupt should all the wisdom be thrown away because of the sins of his father and their generation. I think the Luke from Legends would have been better the Last of the Old and the First of the New\\, this Luke is a shadow of a character.","true":true}
