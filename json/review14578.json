Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a life long Star Wars fan and I watched this opening day in the theatre\\, and have watched it multiple times on BlunRay now and the more I watch it the worse it gets. Watching the bonus feature \\\"The Director and the Jedi\\\" it simply baffles me how Rian Johnson got the job as writer and director. When Mark Hamill voiced his disagreement with what Rian was doing with Luke Skywalker's character\\, it should have been a red flag right there. The Finn \/ Rose story was completely pointless. Kudos to the cast for trying to make this terrible story work.\\n\\nSo disturbing the film's critic scores are hyper inflated. It's clear true Star Wars fans hate the film. I really wish Disney could do a take back on this movie.","true":true}
