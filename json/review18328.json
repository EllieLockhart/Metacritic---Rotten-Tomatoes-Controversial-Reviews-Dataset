Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this movie was great. My family loves Star Wars and I know many people have bashed this film so I had low expectations going in but was very happy. A lot of soul from the Star Wars legacy came through while at the same time setting the stage for the new generation of players. Good movie in my book.","true":true}
