Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed the film for it's visual imagery but not for the storyline. I found it very boring and lacking in details. Where-as the originals\/prequels presented a great depth to characters here we get slight feel for them and nothing more. It's almost as if there was nothing else to learn about them. There are also way to many plot holes in this thing\\, none can be justified as simple reasoning should have revealed their presence. Over-all it felt like a project for a college course in film.\\n\\nNote: I'm noticing a lot of positive audience reviews here\\, but when I click many of the profiles they are not found. Could these be fake?","true":true}
