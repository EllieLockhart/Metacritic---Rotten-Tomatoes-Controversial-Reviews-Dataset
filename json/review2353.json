Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At the bottom of the Star Wars barrel and near the bottom as a stand alone movie as well.  Nothing new to say other than I'm tired of Hollywood trying to shove their political views down people's throats in movies.  This is a prime example of what happens when they do.  They ruined old characters and you only grow to hate the new characters more each second you watch them.","true":true}
