Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A star wars film that manages to both be as lacking in complexity as previous installments\\, but without any of the charm. The movie is competent and has interesting\/fun moments\\, but these moments are enjoyed separately from the film that surrounds them.  Many returning characters are either pointless nods to the audience or\\, as in the case of one Luke skywalker\\, completely unrecognizable in their behavior and characterization.  The relationship between lead protagonist Rey and Antagonist Kylo Ren is interesting (their scenes are unmistakably some of the best) but unfortunately falls flat at its conclusion.  \\n\\nspeaking of falling flat... the attempts at humor in this film rarely\\, if ever\\, hit their mark (the worst are downright depressing).  dialogue is spotty enough without marvel-esque scene diffusing (and utterly inappropriate for the situation at hand) \\\"jokes\\\" getting in the way\\, most of which feel more like a line delivered directly to the audience rather than the characters present in the scene.  \\nFailing humor.  Lacking charm.  Plot holes... lots of plot holes.  \\nBut what did we expect?\\nThis isnt George Lucas's star wars anymore where\\, even if it was bad\\, at least you knew he cared.  This is Disney corporate doing what Disney corporate does: making money.  And s long as we keep watching it\\, they'll keep sucking the life and charm out of all of our favorite franchises.","true":true}
