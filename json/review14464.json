Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hated how the ruined Luke\\, I mean really???   And what was the purpose of Rose and Canto Bight???  Such a waste!!!  The previews looked awesome but the movie sucked!!!   I won't see it again and I won't be buying in on blu ray either.  The force awakins was great!  Rogue one also great!  Solo was awesome!!! But TLJ is the worst Star Wars movie behind attack of the clones.","true":true}
