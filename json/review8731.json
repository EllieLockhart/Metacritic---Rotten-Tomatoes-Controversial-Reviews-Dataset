{"101487":121612,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For all the Hardcore Star Wars fans disappointed with TLJ\\, I believe I speak for\/with you... !!!Spoilers!!! To all the people who say we are a bunch of whiny fanboys whose theories didn\u2019t pan out.. You are right\\, but only to a point.. Yes\\, Star Wars fans are hard to satisfy\\, I\u2019ll give you that. We have loved and fantasized over the OT ever since we were young or children\\, in some ways it shaped who we are and what our dreams are in a sense. So now the originals\\, especially Empire which embodies the perfect sci fi fantasy story\\, are up on a pedestal.. I\u2019ll admit\\, some of us do nitpick things too harshly\\, nothing can be as perfect as Empire because it\u2019s been a part of us for what seems like forever. But I promise you\\, I along with so many other fans could\u2019ve written a far better story than this.. One that everyone would\u2019ve enjoyed more\\, while giving justice to our heroes... First off\\, I wanted\\, so badly to love this movie! It\u2019s Star Wars!! I actually thought it was set up really well from TFA and the questions to be answered were so exciting and finally here! Skywalkers history\\, the fall of the new Jedi order and the Knights of Ren\\, Snokes origin\\, and tons of others along with Rey\u2019s parents.. (I think she should\u2019ve been Han and Leia\u2019s daughter\\, Bens twin\\, Luke\u2019s niece. And by some incident\\, they all thought she died when Rey and Ben were very young. Which Ben thought was his fault\\, causing a rift in the whole family and putting him on the path of the dark side. That Snoke stole her and hid her away from them all in a shadow of the dark side\\, changing her name\\, washing away her memories and abandoning her on a remote planet.. Then he pushed Kylo like Sidious pushed Anakin. Installing fear\\, then spreading it to Luke as something that they brought about\\, out of fear of trying to stop it from coming true\\, just like Anakin... The perfect way to destroy the Skywalkers from within and explain all the feelings of connection teased... IMO) Wouldn\u2019t that have been so much more interesting and exciting than... They\u2019re nothing\\, nobodies... I was so caught up on the thought that I had just seen the new Star Wars and seen Luke again\\, that I didn\u2019t even know I was disappointed until I was on my way home from the movies... It\u2019s not just that our theories didn\u2019t pan out\\, it\u2019s that you just don\u2019t understand... Let me paint a picture.. Ever since my friends and I were kids\\, maybe 8 we\u2019ve been watching the movies\\, playing the games and with the toys. We always dreamed of the further adventures of Luke Skywalker. Then we have 30+ years of the Star Wars expanded universe books and stories showing us just how awesome Luke becomes. So after Lucas makes his prequel trilogy\\, we think of how awesome it\u2019d be to see Luke on the big screen fulfill being as powerful\\, if not more so than Yoda and all Jedi or Sith.. But we never think it\u2019ll happen. Then we find out it actually will many years later! We are so excited\\, thrilled that after 34 years\\, Skywalker is BACK!!!... Then we get this version.... And it is an absolute\\, complete letdown of everything we had hoped and looked forward to.. A disappointment\\, in every sense of the word. I could\u2019ve been completely fine with everything else in the film if Luke would have actually done something amazing\\, had actually redeemed himself\\, had an awesome lightsaber duel\\, even turned on his legendary green saber!?!? But no\\, and now he never will because he\u2019s dead!? They tried so hard to be unpredictable\\, they basically dropped entire plot lines in order for it to be something unexpected. Which is not only really bad story telling\\, it is essentially a complete waste of time... Characters and plots that were built up and teased from TFA were rendered useless\\, ending suddenly with unrealized potential all for the sake of \u201cnone of the nerds saw this coming\u201d... That is not how you make a movie... NO ONE\\, wants to go watch Avengers Infinity War to see the director surprise us with something unforeseen like them giving up the second Thanos arrives. To see the heroes of another amazing franchise cower and run to another planet and ditch the world to its fate. And then maybe distract him from a safe distance for a second so some people can get away... Then die without doing anything awesome... Does that sound like the Avengers?? Like a movie you would enjoy?? Ok\\, well this doesn\u2019t sound like our Luke Skywalker! Want to shape new heroes for the next generation\\, ok do it\\, that\u2019s great.. Include them\\, build their story in like TFA\\, but don\u2019t shit all over our heroes while it is still their saga. It\u2019s still the Skywalker saga if I\u2019m not mistaken\\, that is what it\u2019s about right? If it\u2019s not\\, then this should be it\u2019s own movie or trilogy and not episode 7\\, 8 and 9.. The millions of fans deserved so much better! We have Star Wars because of Lucas and because of the fans that fell in love with his vision and gave his dream a chance to be realized! This movie let them both down... I could keep going with so many other points\\, but I\u2019ll just say this.. Maybe the biggest reason that keeps us hating on Rian Johnson\u2019s movie\\, is that we KNOW in our hearts that it is not the true Star Wars story.. This version feels like a false story\\, an imposter in the Star Wars saga that doesn\u2019t belong. Because we KNOW that it is not what George Lucas\\, the creator of all that is a Galaxy Far Far Away\\, would have given us.. And it\u2019s not what Mark Hamill\\, Skywalker\\, the legend himself\\, had envisioned his character to be. We know\\, that they have the real Skywalker story.. And now\\, we\u2019ll never get to see it because of Disney and Johnson\u2019s decision to be\\, completely unpredictable.. So much so that they have nearly ruined a beautiful thing.... ","true":true}
