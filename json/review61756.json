The last of us part 2 however is not that game. The last of us part 2 is an absolute dumpster fire. I feel naughty dog did a disservice to its fans of the first game. The trailer was designed in a way to where you can tell the company knew the game wasn't going to be liked. This was a desperate attempt to get sales up and isn't even the worst part. The game in itself is absolutely terrible. The gameplay itself is pretty good but the writing is absolutely terrible. The pacing is off\\, the game's sequence of events would actually work better in a different order because it's terribly put together. It's fine to kill off a character but if that character is the face of the franchise then don't kill them off in the first 2 hours in the dumbest way you can think of. This game forces you to play as a new character with little to no development and makes the previous protagonists the monsters of the game. You liked the old characters? Hell no you're a terrible homophobic hater who only dislikes the game to get at Neil. The game couldn't have been executed more poorly. In my opinion this game is the biggest waste of 60 dollars but if you HAVE to get it buy a used copy. So many people have returned this piece of crap that the used copies actually rival the new ones. But be aware if you do buy a used or new copy of this game some places are no longer taking returns because the game has come back in droves. Take my advice and steer clear of this game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
