Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film ruined Lukes character and the story was unconsistent with force awakens. Ray's parents revelation was a huge upset to what it could of been and the casino scene was a waste of time. Lots of unexplained plot between the films and for the most part a lot of second thinking and twisting to the plot mid movie. Ryan Johnson wanted to try something new by dodging and weaving past every possible exspectation a longtime fan could of had thought up with that could of made any scene better to give us this dissapointment. Even skimming some of the theory forums could of given him an idea to what fans were anticipating and gone off it. Ray being a grand palpatine? Thus explaining her strong force powers and rapid skill\\, or snoke being plagaus? Giving that character far more meaning and significance and having luke duel him in a most epic showdown never before seen in star wars history\\, we are talking crators forming\\, ground cracking\\, planet evecuating level intensity. He instead made everything \\\"a twist\\\" and thus ruining the movie. Next time he should listen to the fans\\, if he gets a next time.","true":true}
