Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Apart from the white and red mineral planet\\, I hated EVERYTHING in this movie! And they even overdid the \\\"red theme\\\" in the promotion posters. I could tell just from the pretentious color palette that this film was going to suck. People keep calling this film \\\"beautiful\\\". I can't think what they're talking about except for the planet mentioned above. What else is \\\"beautiful\\\"? Garbage.","true":true}
