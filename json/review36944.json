Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was inconsistent with the personalities of the characters that were established before this movie. The new characters also failed to be of any true interest except one at the beginning that doesn't last to the end. There were times when I also thought that I was watching two movies in one and the short one didn't look related to Star Wars. If this were another movie not connected to Star Wars I'd give this a 3\/5 but I will stand with my rating I have given this which is less than 1.5\/5.","true":true}
