Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I? find the actions of Luke Skywalker to be pretty unbelievable and at times demeaning. I? know Luke Skywalker would not abandon his sister and is wise enough to not abandon his destiny. His actions in the return of them Jedi prove that he would give his own life and he is willing to do the right thing\\, not the easy thing. I? believe this movie took away the integrity of the character. I? think it was embarrassing to see Luke Skywalker do\\, and say some of the things he did. This movie gave me much fear for the future of Star Wars. I? miss good old days","true":true}
