Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such a massive let down and waste of one of the greatest sci-fi properties of time. I wouldn't recommend this move to anyone who is an actual fan of the Star Wars Universe. The only reason to watch it is so you can see how bad people can screw up one of the most important story arks of all time.","true":true}
