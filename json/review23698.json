Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke dying was weak. Reys parents Story was a cop out. No explanation of Snoke. Cheesy moments like luke dusting his shoulder off were cringe worthy. Rey as a character is underdeveloped. Had chance to kill off Finn a useless character and saved him instead. Leaves no questions worth asking for the next movie. Prequels are looking better and better after these Disney movies.","true":true}
