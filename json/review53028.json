Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a one off movie\\, the Last Jedi could be given a strong score. However its not. I feel Johnson does not understand the cultural power of Star Wars. I'm a 55 year old father who has seen every Star Wars movie multiple times in the theater along with making and buying Star Wars toys and costumes. I am a total fan. I feel if you watch the special features of the 'Force Awakens' and 'The Last Jedi' you'll will see why 'The Last Jedi' Failed.  Abrams Directors Documentary was about his important role to the legacy and honoring the past and future of the family saga and the importance of the metaphors and personal characters within saga. The most common words heard from Abrams were 'We' 'History' 'Honor' 'Respect'. When I watched Johnsons Directors documentary\\, It was about images\\, sets\\, and surprise. Johnsons most common word is 'I'. Its all about what he thinks and wants. Nothing to do with the big picture. Force of change is missing. Star Wars is more then a movie. It gives us parents and mentors REAL examples to teach our kids. Johnson seemed to not care about any of the cultural importance to the history and cultural legacy. It just seemed he wanted to compete with 'Thor' or 'Wonder Woman'. Please change Directors to someone who cares about our legacy.","true":true}
