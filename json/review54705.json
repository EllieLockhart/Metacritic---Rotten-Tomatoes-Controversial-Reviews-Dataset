Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really really had high hopes for this film. Disney proved with TFA and Rogue One that they had the ability to handle new Star Wars films well yet they have totally dropped the ball with this one. I cringed a bit at the jokes and slapstick in the opening sequence but thought hang on\\, stick with it\\, but by the time Luke took back his old light sabre from Rey and then shrugged and chucked it over his shoulder I knew we were doomed. Humour used to be handled through the medium of droids in a lot of the older Star Wars films but now it seems every character is given a cheap joke book to recite from\\, it certainly doesnt feel like Star wars. In places the script and acting seemed a bit wooden\\, almost like this was a rehearsal and the real film would come on in a minute.\\nSomething unforgivable though is the treatment of Luke and I can totally see now why Mark Hamill made the comments he did earlier in production about how he completely disagreed with the direction his character had been taken. The sad thing is there was so much scope for greatness - Luke Skywalker our childhood hero was returning after 30 years to offer his wisdom and train a new Jedi in the ways of the force and wield his light sabre against the forces of evil - except for none of that happens. Its a tragedy and now that its happened\\, thats it\\, theres no going back to rectify it. Such a shame.\\nThere were moments of greatness but unfortunately they were quickly overshadowed. Those terrible CGI Puffin things\\, the odd care taker creatures on the Jedi island\\, the whole pointless Finn and Rose story arc in the random casino\\, the abrupt death of Snoke with no explanation as to who\\, where\\, why\\, his weird samurai guards pulling kung fu poses at the slightest hint of threat\\, the two dimensional new characters that gave you nothing to care about (Laura Dern and her purple rinse hair!)\\, the lack of progression of new characters and the bad treatment of old ones and a plot and story that was pretty jumbled and just plain uninteresting. Oh man\\, i feel robbed. I dont know what they can do with Ep 9 to rectify this and i feel sorry for the team that have to try and put it all right. \\nWhat I also dont get is the huge amount of positive reviews this film is getting from critics? Its maddening. The User score has finally come down to 59% but it seems there are a lot of dubious reviews from fake accounts. I have clicked on a lot of 5 star reviews only to find that the profile doesnt exist and get a \\\"page not found\\\" error. A sad state of affairs all round :(","true":true}
