The only reason IA fantastic game that deals with the fallout from the original story while presenting an entirely new narrative to interweave with it.  Naughty Dog hits it out of the park with the same emotional intensity of the first game\\, and manages to do something no other game in my playing history has done: get me actually conflicted about the weight of my actions during gameplay.  The only reason I don't give it a perfect 10 is because the enemy AI is still a bit silly at times (multiple enemies walking into the exact same spot I've melee killed three of their comrades in) and there were definitely times where I felt the game dragged during obvious \\\"scavenging breaks\\\" between action sequences.  But ND does a solid job of still incorporating enough dialogue and story into these breaks that they still have a flow to them.  Players will be split on some plot points\\, but I think that those automatically giving a 1 rating based on leaks alone obviously missed the point that the developers were making here.  If you've already ruined the game for yourself by reading leaks\\, that's on you\\, because you missed out on an incredible experience that lives up to its predecessor.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
