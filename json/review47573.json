Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What the heck is everyone talking about not liking this film.  Are there things to nit-pick about\\, sure.  But really\\, this is one of THE BEST Star Wars movies EVER made.\\n\\nIt's got a little bit of everything and it's plotlines and story arc aren't nearly as repetitive as Force Awakens.  It's just a really fun\\, exciting movie that gives us all sorts of new insights into the Star Wars universe.\\n\\nFantastic movie\\, I'll be going back while it's still in theatres!!","true":true}
