Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Acting like a rebellious teenager\\, spends too much effort  willfully undermining it's predecessor. Avengers-lite humour that doesn't hit the mark\\, pointless filler sub-plots\\, disappointing character arcs\\, unfulfilling answers for some important questions\\, and overall a real loss of the sense of grandeur and mythos that I associated with 'Star Wars'. \\nWe have lost some of the characters that are enshrined within the story\\, yet have kept a number that don't feel like they belong and in fact struggled to find anything to do in this film.\\nDisappointing.","true":true}
