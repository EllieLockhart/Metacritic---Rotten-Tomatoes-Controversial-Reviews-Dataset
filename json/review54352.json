Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never written a review for a movie but I hated the last jedi so much I couldn't let it go. I have been a Star Wars fan all my life. I grew up on the prequels and games like KOTOR. I lived Star Wars. I was so exicited when they started to make new ones. The Last Jedi not only craps on the legacy of the Star Wars universe it destroys any future the triligio had. No one who was a fan or basic knowledge of the Star Wars universe could have produced such a movie. The forced \\\"diversity\\\" was off putting and unneeded. But for me\\, the worse thing was the betrayal of the character of Luke Skywalker. Darth Vader's last words to Luke was that he was right. Luke Has also seen the good and potential in people. This is an individual who fought the empire\\, fought in wars\\, faced his fear. He went on a suicide mission to conflict and redeem his father. Yet according to Last Jedi\\, this same character tried to kill his nephew for some slight conflict. That he hide away on a backward planet just to die?  This movie has nothing to do with Star Wars. I don't care about next film. Rey is a mary sue\\, she isn't going to turn to the Dark Side\\, she is going to beat Kylo Ren without effort. And the resistance will magically win. I truly hope that Disney learns a lesson in this. Don't let a bad director and SJWs ruin a franchise that took 40 years to build.","true":true}
