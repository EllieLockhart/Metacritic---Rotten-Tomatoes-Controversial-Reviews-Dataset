Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An ok movie high on action yet little plot. The whole movie is a big fan fiction love fest that really doesn't carry on from the previous movie(s). Rey gets very little development other than the idea that she came from nothing yet can do anything without much trying or training. The Force has suddenly turned into this do anything you can think of and it happens power. Like I said very fan fiction stuff. Luke is a depressed mental basket case. BB 8 gets more heroics and things done than any character in the movie. Snoke is never developed or explained\\, and Kylo is still an irredeemable self centred brat. Leia is the only good smart person here who actually makes sense even when she defies on logic concerning the Force and instead of getting the send off she deserves\\, we will get it off \\nscreen unless they recast. \\n\\nThe actin is good and the sets were nice \\, but this was held together by duct tape and string.","true":true}
