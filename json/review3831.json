Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bigots hate it\\, even if they haven't seen it: someone daring to be both female and non-white is just too much. That's not a reason to like it of course; if you're a normal Star Wars fan\\, you might be disappointed that your expectations didn't pan out (on this matter the trailer is pretty misleading) or that this isn't the Star Wars story structure you're used to\\, but it absolutely nails the Star Wars moments you know and love. If you're not so familiar with Star Wars\\, it's a thrill-ride of a sci-fi adventure. Unlike the pre-Rogue One Star Wars films\\, this steps away from simple formula to give us interesting characters and situations more nuanced than \\\"winning\\\" and \\\"losing\\\"\\, and that unusual combination puts it firmly towards the top of its genre\\, boding well for episode IX and the inevitable continuance of Star Wars anthology films.","true":true}
