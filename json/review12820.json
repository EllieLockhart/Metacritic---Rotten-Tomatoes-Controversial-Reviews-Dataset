Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I did not like this movie at all. It made me depressed it was so bad.\\nI'm going to go binge watch the first six movies to get this terrible\\, terrible movie out of my mind. As long as Disney makes a Star wars movie I wont be watching any more of them.","true":true}
