Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw this twice in the theater.  I love this movie.  After Force Awakens introduced us to Rey & company\\, I was hoping they continued in great compelling story.  I was not disappointed.  The movie is full of surprises that you're not expecting.  That's what I really like about it.  It's not stuck in a rut of you're going to see the same things we've always seen and they aren't afraid to kill off characters.  Since I've purchased the blu-ray\/digital\\, I've watched it at least a dozen more times.  It makes me thirst for more of these characters and wonder where they will go next when Episode IX arrives.","true":true}
