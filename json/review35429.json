{"101487":174970,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-28","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi continues the evolving saga of Star Wars\\, taking us to new locations\\, and showing us the humanity of heroes and legends we maybe have put too much faith in\\, while at the same time allowing a new generation of heroes to rise.  I know there are lots of criticisms of certain scenes\\, but Leia's scene is not that out of character for what Force users have done in the past (Death Star trench run\\, pod racing\\, etc).  I still have questions\\, and I'm looking forward to the novel to fill in some details.  But I think this was a worthy entry into the series.  #wearethespark","true":true}
