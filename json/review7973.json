Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Extremely hard to do it worse. Not only it is a failed movie but also deprived The Force Awakens of any interest it could have previously had and made Ep. IX uninteresting since it left absolutely nothing to look forward to. I am not even a Star Wars fan but this movie feels so disrespectful to the original idea of Star Wars that it's hurtful to watch (and also boring)","true":true}
