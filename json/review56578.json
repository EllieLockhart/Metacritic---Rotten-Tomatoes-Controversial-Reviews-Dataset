Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a new experience of Star Wars\\, which is dedicated to youth\\, who sees the film as a modern version of great stories\\, a great CGI animation\\, as well as new and old characters of the saga\\, which grow transcendentally. Although\\, for an old fan\\, it seems insufficient\\, with plot holes and expectant villains\\, like Snoke\\, who fall; It is true in some points\\, but in the end the film is surprising and creative.","true":true}
