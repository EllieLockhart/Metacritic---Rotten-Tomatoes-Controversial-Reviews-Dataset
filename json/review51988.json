Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After a disappointing Force Awaken\\, which to me was too similar to the original trilogy and rather play it too safe\\, we see something new. I love the storyline of my childhood hero\\, Luke Skywalker\\, despite all the hate. Some questionable sequences\\, and one forceful plot for a character change\\, but other than that\\, this is the Star Wars movie that has balls to not just please the theory-hunger fans\\, but take the franchise in a new direction.","true":true}
