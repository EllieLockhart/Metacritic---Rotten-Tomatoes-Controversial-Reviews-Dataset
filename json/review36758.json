Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie moved at a great pace and added some strong characters. I felt like the extra little scene at the very end\\, after Leia and Rey had their conversation was extraneous - I would think fans would know the force is everywhere whether there are Jedi wielding it or not. But that scene is my sole complaint.","true":true}
