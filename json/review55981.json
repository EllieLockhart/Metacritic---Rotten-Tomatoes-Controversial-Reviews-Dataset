Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ryan Johnson\\, you did it\\, you have made the worst Star Wars film you could have done. This episode kills episode VII\\, because all the questions and story lines that are created in VII are killed in episode VIII. \\nSPOILERS:\\n- The story of the resistence (Poe\\, Leia\\, Finn): Honestly\\, I am not interested in. The \\\"death\\\" of Leia was very good done\\, but instead of leaving her dead\\, she transformed in Superman. The mission of Finn and Rose\\, is literally\\, useless; there is not reason to make this mission to the casino\\, and all this useless story line\\, including the Poe's riot is because the lady who replaces Leia does not want to tell the plan to Poe.\\n- The beginning of Rei's story is a bit slow\\, but is increasing as her power. I like the relation of Luke and Rei\\, and also how she is lost between the light and the dark.\\n- The link of Kylo and Rei is very well done. Also the battle of both of them versus the emperator guards is very good. BUUT\\, there are a lot of problems there: I have already seen a lot of this scenes in the return of the jedi; Snoke\\, the interesting and powerfull\\, new emperator\\, that he sees every thing\\, he is not able to see how kylo kill him.\\n- The question of who are the parents of Rei\\, well\\, they are nothing.\\n- The scene of Luke with Yoda\\, returnig Luke to the way of the force\\, I think is the better scene of the film. But\\, the final scene of how Luke becomes one with the force it's wierd. I mean\\, he projected one younger Luke in Qrait\\, the planet where the resistence was\\, anf confronts Kylo to help the resistence to escape\\, and later\\, he is tired and becomes one with the force.\\n- I am not going to jutge the \\\"funny moments\\\" because I have not got a little smile on my face.","true":true}
