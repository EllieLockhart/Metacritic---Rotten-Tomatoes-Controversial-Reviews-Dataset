Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie does not make sense with the Star Wars lore that was created in previous movies and seems to disregard anything that it has built on\\, Rian Johnson's interpretation has disrespected the franchise\\, characters like rose were not needed in this movie and felt forced into parts that were not needed. Even jar jar binks as bad as it was\\, had a place in the prequels that made sense\\nWe did not get to spend time with characters that should have been developed more within this movie new and old\\, rather than it becoming a bore and not reveling answers to questions the audience added more questions by dragging out the movie. And where the heck was Lando another fan favourite in this mess of a movie?","true":true}
