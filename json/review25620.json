Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a good use of Mark Hamil (Luke)\\,  he is the one. Although great to see him as Luke again\\, there is so much more they could of done\\, instead we get wish wash story with a spoiled brat as the antagonist. The good movies are defined by a good villain here you just don't have one. At least the prequels had Darth maul their saving grace and a duel between obiwan and Anakin(Darth Vader). For me Star Wars ended at \\\"Return of the Jedi\\\" Luke saved the universe and lives on!","true":true}
