Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Huge disappointment for a Star Wars movie.  I left The Force Awakens with a huge smile on my face.  I left The Last Jedi slightly depressed and very disappointed.  The director of this movie did no fan service at all.  Had no respect for the original characters or the new villain\\, and instead gave us an insufferable sub plot that damaged the movie.  JJ Abrams should have been the director for all 3 movies in this new trilogy because he's actually a Star Wars fan like us and actually had bigger plans for Snoke in the future.  What a damn shame.  Even Mark Hamill didn't care for the movies script or his character\\, and that says everything you need to know right there.","true":true}
