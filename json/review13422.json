Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed the risks taken in this movie ultimately I believe they paid off in a good way. It's refreshing to see a new side of Star Wars. Go into this movie not trying to please your own fan fiction stories and you will greatly appreciate the film. Though there are a few sequences I could have done without overall I am greatly pleased with this chapter in the series.","true":true}
