Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a longtime star wars fan but this movie was disappointing. They kill off the villain like most Disney movies\\, I had to watch Luke the great Jedi master milk some sea cow hunt for some fish while having Rey following him. They kill Luke and Snoke leaving boring characters to be seen in the next one.","true":true}
