Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After digesting this for 24 hours\\, this movie is so disappointing.  Snoke is purely a meaningless Mcguffin  and Rey is revealed to be nothing more than a Mary Sue.  Seriously Disney?  I've grown up with these\\, slept outside of theaters to see the movies on release nights in my youth.  How dare you disrespect the characters to this extent.  Betray the world building and lore.  \\n\\nAnd to the critics\\, pull your heads out of your check books and stop taking kickbacks.  Justice League was a better film that this train wreck\\, but it's professionally okay to rail on DC when you feel obligated to bow down to the house of mouse.","true":true}
