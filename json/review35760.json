Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is entertaining\\, and also has pieces of Star Wars thrown throughout the picture\\, but it's no Empire Strikes Back\\, Y'all. How long do we intend to keep the shoulder brush relevant? Apparently\\, the writers or director feels for a very long time. Anywho\\, go check it out\\, just remember it's a movie.","true":true}
