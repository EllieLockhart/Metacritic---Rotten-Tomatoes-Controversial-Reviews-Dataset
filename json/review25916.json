Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not great. The film was a nice piece of eye candy much like TFA\\, but completely threw out past Star Wars themes and didn't bother following up on elements from TFA. It was also pretty strung out and dull\\, first Star Wars film where I've gotten bored enough to want to walk out.","true":true}
