Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was terrible.  The plot was full of holes and made no sense.  The movie does not fit in with the original trilogy\\, and even doesn't fit in with the last film.  It's shocking how poorly written this movie was.","true":true}
