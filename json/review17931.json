Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think fans are being far too critical. This film will stand up to the test of time and is certainly on par with the originals. This is an excellent film that honors Star Wars and brilliantly further establishes this universe for a new generation. Disney has done a brilliant job with rebooting this property.","true":true}
