Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While it certainly has it's moments\\, it fails in some very key points such as structure and storytelling. It seems to follow similar tropes as other Star Wars films\\, but without having respect for them. Like Empire strikes back without the soul.","true":true}
