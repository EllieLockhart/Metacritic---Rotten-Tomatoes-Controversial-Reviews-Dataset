Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot is a hot mess with way too much forced humour. Additionally there were some cringeworthy scenes\\, scenes that don't make sense and underutilized characters.  Visually It was amazing\\, but not enough to save itself from the awful director that is Rian Johnson. It honestly makes The Phantom Menace and Stack of the Clones look like pretty good films. Let's see if JJ can save the series with the next one\\, here's hoping.","true":true}
