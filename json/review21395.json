Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wish I could rate this zero stars.  What an absolute garbage movie.  I went into this movie with such high hopes after two years of waiting after the cliffhanger in The Force Awakens\\, only to have what seemed like a bad dream to occur.  Terrible one line humor better served in a Benny Hill episode\\, no resolution to the previous film's setups\\, and filled with current day liberal politics.  After the flying Leia scene I nearly walked out.  I have never walked out of ANY movie\\, and nearly did out of this one.  The franchise is dead to me and I literally have NO DESIRE to see episode 9.  This is also the first Star Wars movie I will not go see a second time in the theater.  What a betrayal to the fans.  Oh and I don't believe for one second that the audience score is being driven down by duplicate accounts or bots\\, the movie is really just that awful.  Sorry if full of spelling mistakes\\, I am typing on an iPhone.  Disney laid an absolute goose egg with this one.","true":true}
