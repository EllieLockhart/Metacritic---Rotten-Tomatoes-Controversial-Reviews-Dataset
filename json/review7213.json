Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Entertaining but maybe it's a bit slow in some circumstances.\\nThere's a scene that I found not right: General Leia flying.\\nThis movie has a bit of the new trend that I call deadpooling: jokes\/humour that you might find appropriate or not in the middle of intense scenes.\\nThe music at very beginning is still memorable.","true":true}
