Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A mess of entirely unbelievable writing\\, contrived plot lines with generally underdeveloped characters who are seldom interesting. Romantic subplots are forced. In spite of being the longest Star Wars movie yet\\, it fails to have a significant moment where the characters can be taken seriously\\, to the extend that I believe the writers simply don\u2019t care about the original vision behind the series. The adage \u2018show don\u2019t tell\u2019 comes to mind as something both writers and actors should think long and hard about. At the very least it is apparent that they tried to write something somewhat different\\, I just wish it was decent enough to differentiate itself from the archetypal mindless summer action movie. Long-time Star Wars fans of the EU in particular will probably be disappointed by this film. Those who enjoy every marvel movie produced and want more cheesy Disney-esque moments in movies will probably adore it. If there\u2019s one thing this movie highlights\\, it\u2019s the modern cynical character of franchise films like this\\, in that we all know they don\u2019t have to be good- the producers don\u2019t have to care about it. Money will be made on the brand alone\\, and so the product suffers. In conclusion\\, the characters and settings are generally forgettable\\, the writing that of a bad comic book\\, and to longtime fans\\, I think it\u2019s pretty clear that Disney doesn\u2019t respect the universe based upon the inconsistencies of this movie. It does look pretty though. My heart goes out to Mark Hammil\\, and all those who are going to watch Rian Johnson\u2019s next slew of Star Wars spin-offs.","true":true}
