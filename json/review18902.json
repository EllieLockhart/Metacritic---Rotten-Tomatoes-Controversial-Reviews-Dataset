Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a solid movie for a non-star wars fan. Has it's great moments and some so so ones. I didn't like some of the paths the movie travel down. In the end it is a movie to set up far more movies in the future for Disney.","true":true}
