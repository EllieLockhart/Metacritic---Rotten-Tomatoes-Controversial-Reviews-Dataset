Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was made to sell toys. Don't even waste the money seeing this in a theater. What complete garbage. \\n\\nThis movie makes episode I\\, II\\, & III look like GOLD. That is how bad this film was. Shit\\, at least in those films we saw sweet light saber duels and space battles that made enduring the lousy acting and weak lines more tolerable... But WTF was this!? \\n\\nI can't even list all the things that were pathetically bad about this extremely hyped up movie. The big shame was that it had the acting talent. But talk about gutter writing. And really\\, it's just like anything else. FOLLOW THE MONEY. I know that I should know better\\, but I was wishfully thinking things were going to get epic. \\n\\nThis movie was designed to sell merchandise and nothing more. If you're into the star wars story this movie is likely going to make you lose faith in the franchise. And you should\\, rightfully so. It was the fucking story line that made us fans LOVE star wars. This pile of crap does no justice to that story line. \\n\\nI will never pay another dime to see anything out of this franchise. Pathetic. \\n\\n\\\"Critics Consensus: Star Wars: The Last Jedi honors the saga's rich legacy while adding some surprising twists -- and delivering all the emotion-rich action fans could hope for.\\\"\\n\\nBULLSHIT.","true":true}
