Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie gets the Star Wars Universe wrong. It throws the logic of it out the window. Space battles and the state of the Republic make no sense. Certain subplots are pointless\\, boring and annoying and disturb the movies flow. Even worse\\, they unncecessarily make this the longest Star Wars movie to date. But worst of all\\, the movie erases the nottion of who Luke Skywalker is. From not giving up on his father\\, who happens to be the second most evil person in the galaxy\\, (spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler) he now plans to murder his nephew in his sleep because he has a dark side. Wow! \\n\\nThe movie is a missed opportunity to make good on things teased in Episode 7. But that is not such a big wonder\\, considering Rian Johnson wrote the script for the movie before he knew the plot of Episode 7. That is why this movie feels ridiculously out of touch with the established universe. I am truly disappointed.","true":true}
