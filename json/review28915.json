Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really disappointed in the direction Rian Johnson took the trilogy in. Bad and cringe worthy \u201cfunny\u201d moments ruin some of the good and serious scenes. The Finn subplot was extremely weak and pointless. Adam Driver was the only bright spot\\, he carried the whole movie. ","true":true}
