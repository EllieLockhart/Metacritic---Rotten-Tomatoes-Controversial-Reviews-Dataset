Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly one of the Best Star Wars movies to date\\, it constantly played with my expectations\\, and I think it really added something original to the series. While It wasn't perfect\\, I truly enjoyed this movie and did not at all expect it to be nearly as good as it is.","true":true}
