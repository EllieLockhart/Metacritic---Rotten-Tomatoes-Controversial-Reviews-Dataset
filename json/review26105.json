Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not only was this a bad Star Wars film\\, it was bad sci-fi\\, and basically a bad movie.  The writing was amateur at best.  Characters were bland\\, almost no character growth beyond what we already had in Episode 7.  Numerous plot holes and continuity errors\\, even within the same scene.  A script that was just a rehash of Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.\\n\\nThe theme of the movie seemed to be\\, \\\"Let the old things die.\\\"  Apparently that extends to the Star Wars franchise as well.  Just let it die\\, because it is a god awful travesty if we keep encouraging Disney to make more garbage like this!","true":true}
