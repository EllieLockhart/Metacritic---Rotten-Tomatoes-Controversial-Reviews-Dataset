Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Every expectation of character development comes to nothing. Relationships are not established between characters. Bathos rules every scene that should have a modicum of nuance. Entire character arcs reduced to pointless sequences. Visually uncreative in it's designs and aesthetics. Awful action sequences that frequently make no sense. Ticking clock stakes in the story that makes no logical sense. A portrayal of theme and characters that is so far removed from reality that I can only be convinced the space nazi's were right all along.\\n\\nWe are all worse off for the existance of this film.\\n\\n\\nAlso there's so many bots pushing for higher ratings\\, and bear in mind RT doesn't count 0 or 1\/2 star reviews towards its' audience score. The actual score at the time of this post should be somewhere around 28%","true":true}
