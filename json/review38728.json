Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The writing was just way to all over the place\\, Lukes death was extremely premature and unnecessary(We all know he was going to die\\, but to die this quick? Totally ridiculous imo)\\, Captain Phasmas death??? ... This movie was just all over the place and I dont even know what they were going for specifically with it\\, I wont be totally certain on my opinion until the next movie I guess.","true":true}
