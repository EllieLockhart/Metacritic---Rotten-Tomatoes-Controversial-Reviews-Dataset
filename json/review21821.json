Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just felt like a two and a half hour advertisement. The comedy is ridiculous at times and there are some major plot holes still left unanswered. The comedy is completely out of place in a star wars movie none of the others had it to the same extent.","true":true}
