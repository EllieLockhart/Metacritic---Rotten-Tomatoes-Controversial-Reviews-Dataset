Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hey\\, star wars is star wars. It's great\\, but this did not feel like star wars. humor is great\\, but humor does not belong in this series. there were so many problems with this movie. don't get me wrong\\, I love this movie\\, but it was not good.
