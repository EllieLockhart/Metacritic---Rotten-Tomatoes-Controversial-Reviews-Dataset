Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have to say this could very well be the worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen. I would actually go on to say it's just as bad as Attack of the Clones but for all the opposite reasons. \\n\\nThe only reason this pile of rubbish would even deserve two stars is because I think the actors did a good job with the script they were given\\, many find Luke's character to be divisive but I think Mark did his best to make it his own character and gave it his all. Also some of the visuals of the film were quite good\\, but style and performance cannot save the abysmal plot that you were force fed for two and a half hours\\, for the first time ever I felt like I couldn't wait for the film to end it was that bad. \\n\\nMy main complaint is that it is incredibly slow\\, dull and uninteresting\\, a lot of inflated subplots that detract from the central chase between the Resistance (Rebellion? Who cares what they're called anymore) and the Empire\\, but unlike in the Empire Strikes Back\\, where Han uses his wits and intelligence to outsmart the Imperial fleet through an Asteroid belt\\, the Resistance just pathetically 'fly away' whilst the First Order pathetically shoot pot shots at them for about eighteen hours whilst most of the main characters are off doing something else\\, it's boring\\, dull and doesn't use any ingenuity or creativity to make it interesting.\\n\\nSecondly\\, I get that the whole point of this film was that you were not to 'expect' what was going to happen\\, but to be honest I think all it served to achieve was to just shoot down anything that was set up in the Force Awakens\\, whilst just being a shameless mash up of the Empire Strikes Back and the Return of the Jedi but with the scenes put out of order (Just imagine the battle of Hoth happening AFTER Emperor Palpatine dies in the original trilogy\\, it's just terrible). It's as though Rian Johnson decided to either ignore or dismiss any of the plot points in TFA (Why are Rey's parent's nobodies who died on Jakku when we were shown a vision of them flying away from Jakku in the previous movie? Or why is Luke a bitter old man who doesn't want to help when he deliberately left behind clues of his location so that someone could find him before?). Not only did they inflate the cast with a number of characters that we were suddenly supposed to care about\\, but they killed off a number of the characters we already wanted to have some investment in. Captain Phasma as usual was just treated like dirt\\, Snoke (Who I was actually getting really into) is now entirely irrelevant and we will probably not get to know anything more about his character. It's a terrible cop out that fails to appreciate that a lot of fans want to get a better understanding of what has happened in this new canon.\\n\\nSome scenes were just embarrassing and kind of patronising\\, the casino scene was genuinely awful and a huge waste of the potential that Rose and Finn could have had\\, it felt like something out of a shitty tv movie adaptation of a Charles Dickens novel but with a high end budget\\, complete with decadent businessmen abusing little poor children. Patronising Children in this way is not going to win you any kudos Disney\\, every kid I saw come out of that film yesterday either looked confused or disappointed. I also think it's rather ironic that there was an anti-business and gambling message in this movie just a few weeks after Disney had to put a restraint on EA for putting gambling in a Star Wars video game. It just shows how two faced and cynical it all is. \\n\\nThe biggest problem is that Star Wars has lost any sense of intrigue\\, excitement or mystery that it once used to have. Movies that once took years to make and build hype are now coming out every other year. A story that a lot of people care about and want to see being treated with respect is being handled poorly with the sole intention to turn over a profit. My fears about this movie were stemmed by Mark Hamill's less than enthusiastic attitude about the whole thing\\, and my fears were confirmed when I sat down and had to 'endure' this movie. \\n\\nWas there one scene I genuinely liked? I loved the Yoda scene as it was genuinely unexpected and Frank Oz was the fun classic puppet yoda instead of the boring prequel cgi yoda. But all it did was serve to remind me about how much I'd rather be just watching the Empire Strikes Back and not this absolute fetid turd. \\n\\nYou know what upsets me the most? This is Star Wars I'm talking about. This movie actually angered me this much I went on a giant rant about an unconsequential fantasy movie that I grew up watching as a young kid. That","true":true}
