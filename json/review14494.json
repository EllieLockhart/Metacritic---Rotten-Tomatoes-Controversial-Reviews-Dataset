Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hated this movie so much that I had to sign up here and review it.\\nThis movie was terrible. At multiple times I was utterly bored\\, the movie made me hate most of the current characters and the plot was riddled with plot holes. It introduces to new horrible characters (Admiral Holdo and DJ)\\, new aliens that were made just for marketing toys\\, and it never gave me a reason to like the good guys. Honestly after The Force Awakens and this movie I still haven't got one single reason why I should care about the main heroes.","true":true}
