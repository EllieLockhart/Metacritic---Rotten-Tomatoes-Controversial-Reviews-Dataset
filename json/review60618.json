The Last of Us Part II takes bold choices and bold leaps when it comes to its characters and story\\, in order to justify its existence as a sequel. One can argue that the first game never needed a sequel\\, and this is completely unnecessary\\, but this sequel expands on ideas of the original to keep things complex and fresh.\r\rThe gameplay has greatly improved upon the first\\, with the addition of multiple new mechanics and enemies\\, with huge environments that boast beautiful scenery. Some people might be angry with the addition of new characters\\, but the game uses juxtaposition in its narrative to draw similarities and comparisons between its two main protagonists.\r\rIn all honesty\\, the strength of the plot lies within the player's ability to empathize with the game's characters\\, and if you as a player decides to go into this without an open mind\\, then the experience will be nothing but shallow and it will be extremely unrewarding. It's okay not to like the game\\, but to try not to understand it first and bash it upon completion is not what the game intends for you as a player\\, and is certainly not the right way to approach it.\r\rMy only problem with the game is it's uneven pacing during some parts\\, but that's mostly due to my play style\\, and how I took my time exploring every little corner.\r\rOverall\\, The Last of Us Part II is a worthy sequel to its predecessor in my eyes\\, and is extremely ambitious in its narrative department\\, albeit a few pacing issues.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
