Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Created a login just to review this movie. It honestly deserves 4 stars but it definitel does not deserve all the hate it's getting right now so I'm hoping to even the score. As a new trilogy\\, I think it does an excellent job developing the new characters for ep IX while respecting the old trilogy and daring to try something new. Canto Blight got a little off track\\, and one character's space ride is a far fetched\\, but the final act (really the whole last hour) was everything a Star Wars film is meant to be.","true":true}
