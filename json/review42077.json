Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie obviously had the money\\, characters\\, and overall allure of the franchise behind it to make it a great movie. Without being said\\, it was the pundintry of the current political climate that blew all of this movies potential to hell. What have you done with Star Wars Hollywood? You even botched Luke Skywalker. I can honestly say I'm probably not even going to watch the coming sequels due to the depravity and utter let down this movie was. For sheer botching and politising of what movie goers love most to step into fantasy\\, not to put what we see very day again and again in there faces.","true":true}
