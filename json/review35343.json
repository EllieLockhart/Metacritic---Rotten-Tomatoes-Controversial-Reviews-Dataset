Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The innovative new Force powers\\, the beautifully done Luke and Leia arcs\\, and the devastatingly artistic space chase climax were welcome and refreshing. Unfortunately\\, most of the rest of the film just didn't work. Bogged down by what seems to be Rian Johnson's obsession with out with the old and in with the new\\, the narrative was left helpless and weak\\, suffocating under the weight of excess\\, both in running time for the film and the number of story diversions. Further\\, major cliffhangers from The Force Awakens were simply abandoned in a way that left a gaping hole in the story and its future. This left a very unfulfilling\\, comical erasure of the only mystery that was woven into this new franchise launch. What was so surprising was that\\, despite the film being bloated with unnecessary scenes (cough cough Canto Bight)\\, it just wasn't engrossing. I was relieved to leave the theater at the end.","true":true}
