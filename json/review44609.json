Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Totally destroyed Luke Skywalker as a character. This is not a Star Wars movie. Star Wars is about the Skywalker family. If indeed the revelations in this movie especially about Rey remains Canon and is not changed by the end of the movie\\, then this new sequel trilogy fails and is not a successor to the prequels and the originals. The story arch of the skywalker family being redeemed through Darth Vader\/Anakin and Luke is completely destroyed in this movie.","true":true}
