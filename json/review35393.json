{"101487":174935,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi as a very good movie in my opinion. I have been a Star Wars fan all my life\\, and I would place this film at the level of Empire Strikes Back\\, if not higher. I loved this film. I think the main thing that I liked were the action sequences **SPOILERS FROM HERE ON**\\, specifically the battle between Rey\\, Kylo Ren\\, and the Pratorean Guards\\, all of the space battles\\, and especially the hyperspace Kamikaze scene. All were beautifully done and very on point\\, and I could not be happier. Another thing I liked was the film's portrayal of Luke in general. A lot of negative reviews here are complaining that he was portrayed as a sad old selfish man\\, but in reality\\, I found that this film brought out a new\\, darker side of him (when he tries to murder Kylo)\\, and it was very nice to see that\\, and I think it goes well with the main theme of the film that one must neither be completely on the light side nor the dark. Another thing that a lot of negative reviews here do is hate on how the force is portrayed in general. I liked this\\, and I like how it got rid of the Phantom Menace nonsense of how the force is something that you have to genetically inherit (midichloreans)\\, and restored the ideas from the original trilogy about how the force is something that surrounds everything and that anyone can use it. Another thing I liked about it was how surprising the film was. After watching many hours of theories over the course of a few months\\, I was very pleasantly surprised to find that zero of them were correct. Despite all of this\\, I think that this film did have its flaws. The design of the sequence with Finn and Rose on the casino planet was off\\, and it didn't feel that it belonged in Star Wars. Nevertheless\\, it was still enjoyable to watch\\, despite the poor design. I also felt that the film had humor placed in the wrong places for a Star Wars film. The humor was not overwhelming\\, but I felt that at some points\\, it would interrupt a serious action sequence\\, and I think that in general it got somewhat annoying after a while. Overall\\, this film does have it's flaws\\, but in my opinion it easily makes it to or near the top of best Star Wars movies.","true":true}
