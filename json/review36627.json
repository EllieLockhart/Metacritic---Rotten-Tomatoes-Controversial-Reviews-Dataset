Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is average. Its not bad\\, but its not good either. The plot in this movie barely makes any sense and is in some aspects just stupid and should have  ended like 30 minutes into the film. There are at least 1 new character (Rose) they decided to use and show as somehow important\\, but the character wasn't developed at all and felt forced. Also without much spoiling - they failed to use Snoke as an interesting character. Fans had soo much speculation and theories on who Snoke might be\\, but the movie's approach was shallow and disappointing. And when you finally reach the end of the movie and watching the scene unfolding\\, i was telling myself - they better not pull that trick from the original trilogies again... Dammit...","true":true}
