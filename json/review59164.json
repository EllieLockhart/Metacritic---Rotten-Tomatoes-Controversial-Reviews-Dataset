Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The story is terrible. The first half of the game is good... Then you are forced into playing as Abby.. with beyond boring flashbacks that you have to play through ..the game just drags on and on after.. the game tries to be \\\"ground breaking\\\" in making you question who the real \\\"bad guy\\\" is...but it doesn't \\, because they are both bad people .. they really shove LGBTQ down you're throat here .. we all know Elle is a lesbian from the first game \\, but the person who kills Joel just so happens to be a lesbian \\, who befirends a transexual ? Their sexuality has zero to do with the game at all and it's never really addressed other than when an old bigot says something to Elle..  seems like they went for shock value \\, it's all they really have going for the game . Should have never made a sequel.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
