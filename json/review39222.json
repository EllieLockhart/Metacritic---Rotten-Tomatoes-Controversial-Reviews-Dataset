Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film does have some problems; Rose can be annoying\\, some of the humour isn't that good. But I enjoyed this film. I thought that Mark Hamill was great and Rian Johnson had some good ideas. The space battles and special effects were fantastic.","true":true}
