Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The visuals in this movie are amazing but that is where the good ends. The screenplay is poorly written\\, instead of getting one good \\\"A\\\" plot you get about four \\\"C\\\" plots that don't result in an overall satisfying story. Entire parts of the movie could be cut with no change to the overall plot which leaves the viewer asking \\\"Is this movie almost over?\\\" about 2 hours into this 2.5 hour long movie.","true":true}
