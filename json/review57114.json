Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is definitely not Star Wars in the spirit of the anything to do with the originals. It felt like the director was too worried about trying to carve a name for himself to worry about taking the movie in a good direction. \\nThat being said if you don't approach this as a Star Wars movie at all\\, and just see it as a Space Epic\/Comedy\\, you will rather enjoy it\\, as the actors did a fantastic job. Unfortunately\\, the fact that the movie feeds closer to Spaceballs than it does to Revenge of the Sith should tell you all you need to know.\\nI am not a purist\\, and I don't just want to see a reskin of the George Lucas films\\, however\\, this is a film with Star Wars Characters in it. And it even announces so via the credits...\\nIf you are a Star Wars fan\\, this will leave you in doubt as to the series as you knew it. It reaks of Disney\\, and not even good Disney. Fantastic movie\\, but Rouge One is more Star Wars than this movie could ever hope to be.\\nDisney if you read this\\, cancel any contracts with Rian that you have\\, please let him fade into obscurity\\, or you will never have enough fans left to justify your purchase. I'm sorry Rian\\, this wasn't yours to try to prop your career up on. The reason the other movies were successful is that they weren't trying to be career definers\\, they were telling an amazing story and never used filler content. The casino scenes\\, what the hell were you thinking? The movie was long enough\\, why would you waste my time?","true":true}
