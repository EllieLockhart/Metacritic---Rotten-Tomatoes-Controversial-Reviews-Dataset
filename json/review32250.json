Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi is in my view the best Star Wars film\u2014and the first great Star Wars film\u2014since The Empire Strikes Back was released nearly forty years ago (though some fanboys out there seem to disagree with me and the majority of critics who love the film; that's fine\\, but I won't bother addressing their gripes specifically as I don't find them the least compelling). It's directed by Rian Johnson (who made another great sci-fi film Looper in 2012) in the place of J.J. Abrams who made The Force Awakens\\, and he turns out to be the right person to put this story\u2014which revolves around a more compressed time-frame than other films in the series\u2014onto the screen\\, including different pieces going the on at same time which brings much urgency to the situation (like how Irvin Kershner\\, who had replaced Lucas on Episode V\\, was the right choice for that film\\, also with a more compressed frame\\, among other parallels). This movie is much spectacle\\, and also quite deep\\, building on the legacy of the biggest science-fiction movie franchise ever (along with one of the best) in very satisfying fashion.  \\n\\nAll the major surviving characters from Awakens are back\\, along with some interesting new ones with critical roles to play\\, and like its predecessor the film finds a good the balance between young newer characters and the elder returning ones; nothing seems forced and everyone gets his or her moments. The array of female performers\\, maybe more than any Star Wars film to date\\, in particular shine in Episode XIII\\, the late Carrie Fisher getting a more substantial and interesting role than in Episode VII\\, and Daisy Ridley as Rey continuing her strong-willed\\, fascinating arc into potential Jedi-hood. And out of a nice array of new characters in important parts two are female. The returning Adam Driver\\, John Boyega\\, and Oscar Isaac solidify themselves into this universe too\\, especially Driver whose Kylo Ren I think will go down as the second most memorable villain in the Star Wars saga\\, just behind Darth Vader. Of course Luke\\, played by Mark Hamill\\, with all the buildup carried over from Force Awakens\\, must be mentioned\\, and his part is not disappointing\\, including some delightful surprises. Everyone gets something to do that's a meaningful\\, some make mistakes or act in ways that aren't what we'd consider heroic\\, but that makes it a more human story and more satisfying at the end.  \\n\\nAs always in Star Wars films there are\u2014in addition to the new characters\\, locations\\, and technologies that build upon the universe we've known and loved for decades\u2014new ideas that are explored\\, as well as older ones that are expanded upon (yes\\, even in the prequels had them\\, those ideas just failed to be that memorable or interesting\\, though I was more forgiving to those movies than many were). The success of this film in the area of ideas is one of the biggest reasons why\\, in this trilogy so far\\, we are truly back on track in the Star Wars franchise. \\n\\nIt's pieced together with drama\\, humor\\, and wonder\\, both with freshness and familiarity. It's an exciting\\, intriguing journey the whole way through. The Last Jedi tops The Force Awakens in many respects\\, and ranks among the best science fiction films I have seen in recent years. Of course it's not perfect (even the best Star Wars films this included has had scripts underwhelming in parts)\\, but everyone from true Star Wars fans\\, to those not generally big on the sci-fi genre\\, should have a great time.","true":true}
