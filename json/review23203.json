Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it. Had some humor added with the seriousness of the movie. Glad to see they let Mark Hamill\u2019s personality come through in this one. I know people want \u201ctheir\u201d theories confirmed\\, but I\u2019m glad they didn\u2019t do what fans wanted with this. If Rey\u2019s parents are really no bodies\\, it shows that anyone can be special and it\u2019s not just a movie series about a family drama like Lucas wanted it. ","true":true}
