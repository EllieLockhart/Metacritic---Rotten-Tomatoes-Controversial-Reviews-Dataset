Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star wars movie ruined by SJW propaganda bull**** \\, great acting by some of the actors \\, great visuals \\, but in the end all thrown away by bad writing \\, bad character development and a clusterf*ck number of plot holes also ... they ruined Luke Skywalker and that is unforgiveable","true":true}
