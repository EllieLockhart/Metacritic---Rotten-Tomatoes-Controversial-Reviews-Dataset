Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"People are as whiny as Anakin in the prequels about this movie\\nIt's so sad to see the fanbase raging on a movie just because it isn't what they wanted it to be. People sometimes forget that the beauty of storytelling is that we don't get to choose what the story will be\\, we get to experience what other people do with it so it can be something new and true to the universe. That's why canonicity exists and why fan fiction doesn't count. So get all your whiny ass and start seeing the movie for what it is\\, a new entry in the saga with some of the best moments in SW history\\, and also some bad moments\\, Just because Rey isn't who you expected\\, Luke changed while getting old (like anyone would) and Snoke still isn't explained\\, doesnt mean the movie is bad.","true":true}
