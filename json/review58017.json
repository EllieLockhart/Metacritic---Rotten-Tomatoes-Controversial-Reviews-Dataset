Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While The Force Awakens was somewhat passable in that it sets up future films with potentially interesting subplots\\, The Last Jedi basically takes everything set up in the previous movie and throws it in the trash. Every interesting plot point (Luke searching for the first Jedi temple\\, Rey's heritage\\, how exactly Kylo Ren fell to the Dark Side\\, who is Snoke) are just haphazardly tossed aside so that creators of this film can feel like they are doing their own thing. While the graphics and effects for the movie are definitely top par\\, the constant introduction of major plot holes pulls you out of the experience and makes you wonder why there is not one competent character in the entire film. The constant attempts at humor just fall flat most of the time and often ruins the atmosphere of certain tense scenes. But the biggest problem with this movie by far is the treatment of Luke Skywalker. The Luke that people fell in love with in the original trilogy is absolutely not the same Luke in this film (at times they are almost like polar opposites).\\n\\nIf you're a fan of the original trilogy\\, you will probably not like this film. If your not a fan of the original trilogy and you manage to turn your brain off for the full 2 and a half hours\\, you will probably enjoy this film.","true":true}
