Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"in no particular order ....... Luke dies of using the force to hard ....rey beats Luke up with 0 training........luke is not luke at all...finn is robbed of his heroic act for no reason at all. hyperspace cant be weaponized because its a space outside of normal space\\, watch previous 7 films for reference! casino smashing horse freeing extravaganza but leave the slave children to suffer. new order takes prank call mamma jokes....bb8 can rapid fire casino coins and drive at-st! captain phasma is nothing 2.0 ....finn can pilot a ship right after coming out of medical coma when he needed poe to pilot to escape not even 24 hrs before entering said medical coma....luke rapes an alien sea cow for milk...porgs weren't that bad...luke went to jedi temple for a reason\\, tlj erases that reason...snoke ?  who snoke? snoke not matter? knights of ren? carrie poppins! why weren't poe\\, finn sucked out into space when carrie poppins opened the door! ...rey beats the Pretorian guard with no training...reys parents were set up in tfa...nope they are no one....forced romance between finn and rose with no chemistry....stupid slow  paper thin bombers reliant on gravity to drop bombs!  this movie pisses all over the Force awakens and every other sw movie!  I could go on!","true":true}
