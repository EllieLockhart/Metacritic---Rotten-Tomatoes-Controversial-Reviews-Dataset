Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It\u2019s fantastic. Any negative reviews are just fanboys not getting the same old formula they expect. It goes in completely unexpected directions and is such a unique addition to the saga. It\u2019s fresh\\, original\\, exciting\\, emotional\\, it\u2019s simply fantastic. How it\u2019s getting worse reviews than Force Awakens is stunning. I\u2019ve been a die hard fan my whole life and Force Awakens was nothing but a remake of A New Hope that did noting but pander to fans. The Last Jedi is beautiful. ","true":true}
