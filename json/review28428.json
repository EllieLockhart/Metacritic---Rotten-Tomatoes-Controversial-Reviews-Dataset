Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Prequel trilogy level bad. Even the great performances can't save this movie from its awful script\\, horrible comedic gags and bad cgi moments. It wastes the potential created by the flawed but enjoyable Force Awakens.","true":true}
