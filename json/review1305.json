Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A really terrible film that does not remotely deserve the ridiculously high critic average.\\n\\nGlaring plot holes\\, bad 'humour' that is frequently unfunny and unnecessary\\, a complete lack of character development of all the major characters from The Force Awakens.\\n\\nA film that alienates a huge proportion of the Star Wars fan base\\, and disappoints frequently with bizarre scenes such as the 'Mary Poppins flying in space' moment\\, not to mention the total wasted potential of Luke Skywalker in the movie.. anyway\\, nothing more needs to be said beyond this being a terrible\\, awful movie.","true":true}
