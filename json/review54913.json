Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It\u2019s just ok. Has some good things going for it\\, mostly nostalgia and some cute \\, interesting and entertaining new characters (definitely not any of the main ones\\, excluding Rose). Great score and cinematography\\, nice humor\\, some of it ill placed and other moments on the nose. ","true":true}
