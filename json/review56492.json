Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The opening of this movie is amazing. thinking back every action scene was fantastic. the characters are well developed and the actors (especially oscar issac) fell like they have not missed a beat. however (SPOILERS FOR THE REST OF THE REVIEW) Snoke felt very underwhelming. he did nothing to leave an impression and was so under developed when he died i felt so unfulfilled. to make up for that we have the conflicted and interesting kylo ren who feels like a series villain standout. rey is well acted and well written and if mark Hamill gets zero nominations for his acting i will be very disappointed. his death was a strong but shocking scene overall a good entry in the star wars franchise.
