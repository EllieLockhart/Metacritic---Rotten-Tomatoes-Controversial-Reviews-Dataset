Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don\u2019t usually rate movies but I felt I needed to say how disappointed I was with TLJ. I actually really liked TFA and was really excited to get answers to the questions that were left for the audience to speculate about for 2 years. As many others have stated\\, nothing was answered. It was ignored. Luke didn\u2019t do a damn thing but project a hologram? And now he\u2019s dead? Terrible. Oh\\, there\u2019s Snoke...aaaaand he\u2019s dead. What\u2019s that midget with the giant glasses even doing? And you can just call her up? Her and Finn are pals? The slow speed spaceship chase? Awful. Oh there\u2019s Captain Phasma...aaaand she\u2019s dead. Why even save her for this episode? Rose was an awful character. The casino shit was terrible. Code breaker bla bla. Bad. They infiltrate a ship and wear the bad guys clothes? Haven\u2019t seen that before lol. And the worst of the worst is Leia Superman-ing back into the ship. Wtf. Or was it Luke milking the thing and catching a fish. I cannot decide. Awful. Just awful. Ruined TFA and shit on Luke. Oh and we f*cking get it. Rebels are awesome. Sparks of hope and rebel shit. Cool. We get it. It\u2019s been shoved down our throats already with Rogue One. Some people talk about it and some people are about it. If they\u2019re so cool. Just make them be cool and do cool shit. They seemed like a bunch of dysfunctional whiney babies that talked about how cool being a rebel is. Here\u2019s an idea: show Luke in a lightsaber duel or using his force powers. Have a lightsaber duel at some point period. Make Kylo more of a bad ass if he\u2019s the villain. Make Rey\u2019s parents reveal more eventful if you\u2019re going to rub it in our faces for years. Make Snoke something worth a shit since you made him such a mystery only to kill him immediately. And have someone say \u201cI\u2019ve got a bad feeling about this\u201d. Stop shitting on everything. I\u2019m done. It was straight muff cabbage","true":true}
