Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie achieves everything that I wanted in a sequel to The Force Awakens\\, which largely played it safe with its story in order to set up new characters\\, by doing the unexpected at every turn. It's still a silly action movie\\, just like the original movies were\\, but it manages to dash your expectations against a rock at every turn. Rian Johnson was exactly what the franchise needed at this point. With all of this being said\\, there will be many that will not like it. If you go into this movie \\\"knowing\\\" what a Star Wars movie should be then you will disappointed. Star Wars is in that unfortunate place where people think they know what it should do next and some people despise having those expectations preyed upon.","true":true}
