Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Truly awful. I lost all interest after the opening sequence and the ridiculous\\, low brow dialogue between Poe Dameron and a heavily made up General Hux. \\nThe new characters are dull\\, two dimensional and\\, perhaps deservingly\\, devoid of any back story that may make them of any value to the plot. The squadron seems to be comprised of Mousketeers and the First Order are utter simpletons that can be halted and transfixed by someone deciding to talk to them.\\nI can't be bothered to go into anymore detail as I've already forgotten most of the plot despite very little actually happening\\, the one vaguely interesting character being unceremoniously snuffed out without so much as a single attempt at explaining who he was or where he came from  (or was during the previous 6 instalments of the franchise)\\nLeia is continuously referred to as \\\"The Princess\\\" with her band of rebel fighters seemingly no longer interested in her being a high ranking military commander and instead resorting back to her token title that had been discarded decades before... she a female so is a princess not a General!\\nThis movie may as well have been animated\\, had a big musical number and had all the women in ball gowns.\\nOn a positive note\\, my 8 year old laughed at the bird things.\\nI'll be surprised if I watch this again\\, I really don't care if they make another one\\, my sons will be old enough to go by themselves anyway.\\nIf there wasn't Star Wars in the title this movie would be in bargain bins come the summer.","true":true}
