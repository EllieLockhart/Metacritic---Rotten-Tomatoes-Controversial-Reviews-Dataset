Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it. Its really interesting to me\\, because it definitely feels like it belongs in the Star Wars saga\\, but it's quite different from any of the other films. I think the best way I can describe this with out spoiling things is this: Ep VII was about meeting expectations\\, checking a series of boxes to assure people this is still the Star Wars you knew\\, even to the film's detriment at times. Ep VIII is the inverse. It's about subverting expectations. Luke saying\\, \\\"This isn't going to go the way you think\\,\\\" is accurate.","true":true}
