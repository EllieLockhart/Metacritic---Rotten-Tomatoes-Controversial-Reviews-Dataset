Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let me be clear... this movie was TRASH!!!! Lots of unanswered questions\\, like WHO THE HELL IS SNOKE? Leia becomes Mary Poppins in Space... Luke is a joke.. and the movies plot was a series of unfortunate events. The only redeeming factor of the movie was when it ended! As a fan of the previous movies \\, i feel disrespected!","true":true}
