Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"It's a TRAP!\\\"\\n\\nEvery else has said it all.  Words that come to mind....incoherent\\, failure\\, worthless\\, betrayal\\, incompetent\\, inconsistent\\, lazy\\, shallow\\, fake\\, pointless\\, irreverent\\, incomprehensible\\, boring\\, self-destruction\\, unconscionable\\,  mindless\\, heartless and heart-breaking. \\n\\n40 years of mythology\\, hundreds of books\\, 7 previous films\\, and millions of super fans to pull from and this was the best you can do Disney?  You've been given everything to work with. You have the stories\\, the money\\, the knowledge\\, you simply needed to execute what was right in front of you.  It's as if Brad Pitt had another baby with Angelina with Dr. Oz and Dr. Phil on call and you had Wolfgang Puck making Angie's meals and the baby (The Last Jedi) came out looking like Gollum!  In the eternal words of John McEnroe\\, \\\"YOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS!\\\"\\n\\nI could write a book about this EPIC FAILURE and complete lack of responsibility and irreverence to one of the greatest fantasy stories in human history.  I know this is not going to happen\\, but this film needs to be remade.  Disney will be forgiven.  We all need to take a Xanax and pretend it didn't happen.  I'm serious\\, push back episode IX\\, dump Rian Johnson like yesterday's trash\\, don't recycle anything he gave you either. JJ did alright in the The Force Awakens but if you ask me after watching Rogue One several times that film was fantastic. That was a Star Wars movie.  It had depth\\, drama\\, real threat\\, characters developed that have grown on me after several viewings. The good and bad guys.  We didn't get a chance to love them because everyone died.  The score was on point.  The final minute of the escape and Vader in the final scene was more dramatic and epic than all of The Last Jedi.  Gareth Edwards\\, get him back and get him locked in.","true":true}
