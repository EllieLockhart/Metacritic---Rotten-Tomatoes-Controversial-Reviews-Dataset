Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is such a disappointment. I really\\, really wanted to like this movie but sadly it has\\, for me\\, failed to deliver. True\\, the last 30 minutes are spectacular but getting there is so verbose and tortuous that I almost gave up the will to live. There are certain aspects of the plot that could have been clever and exciting\\, but they are lost in stodgy\\, dull scenes in which nothing of consequence really happens meaning there is little sense of peril or excitement. I knew that there had to be a handing over of the Star Wars canon from the old guard to the next generation and the previous instalment filled me with hope and expectation but The Last Jedi is a bitter disappointment. We have an overly wordy plot\\, some cheap\\, infantile laughs and some very poorly realised characters. Top of my list is the usually dependable Laura Dern as Admiral Holdo\\, the supposed battle hero who looks more like she should be advertising bath salts from the 1980s. Mark Hamill does himself no favours whatsoever either and is\\, frankly\\, annoying. As for poor Carrie Fisher\\, I can only assume she was shown an early cut on that flight back to LA. This feels like a betrayal of all those kids who queued round the block of their local cinema in 1977.","true":true}
