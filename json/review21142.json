Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was thoroughly entertained from start to finish. Tha LAst Jedi felt both new and yet familiar\\, and some obvious moments turned out to be surprises. The side plot was a bit slower than the main\\, but served a purpose. I recommend it to anyone who is a Star Wars or movie fan.","true":true}
