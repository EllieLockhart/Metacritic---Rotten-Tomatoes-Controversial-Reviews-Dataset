Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ showed a more realistic perspective of the galaxy far\\, far away than previous episodes have - and I believe that's a good thing. Everyone fails at times. Heroes\\, villains\\, celebrities\\, nobodies\\, everyone experiences failure throughout life and it messes with the \\n\\\"plan.\\\" I think this beautiful mess made for a fun and exciting chapter in the saga. \\nWas it perfect? Hell no\\, but neither was ANH or even ESB. Enjoy this movie for what it is - don't dwell in what it isn't.","true":true}
