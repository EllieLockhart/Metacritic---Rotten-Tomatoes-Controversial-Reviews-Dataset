Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If there was a one star I would put it down as the worst Star Wars movie. As a life long fan I saw no elements of any of the original or even prequel Star Wars movies. It was childish\\, absurd\\, laughable\\, and down right cringeworthy. I came out of this movie broken-hearted. Thanks Disney 0\/10","true":true}
