Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a Latin American man\\, I say to everyone that is tired of American partisan PC politics and feminism\\, to AVOID this catastrophe at all costs.It took a dump on the cliff hanger left in the force awakens\\, an absolute mess. The Prequels at least felt like Star wars and had memorable cool moments\\, cool fights and a decent entertaining plot and good characters\\, this movie was a bloody mess!","true":true}
