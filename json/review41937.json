Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie just felt boring.  A lot of inconsequential things repeating themselves for 2 and a half hours. Big let down after two very good Star Wars films with The Force Awakens and Rogue One.","true":true}
