Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's sad to see\\, one of the biggest and best cultural phenomenas being slowly eaten by corporate greed\\, and financial exploration. A Star Wars movie used to an event\\, especially for dedicated fans - after the Disney buyout we cant go 5 feet anywhere in the world\\, without being reminded to consume Star Wars. \\nBut then again\\, what kind of franchise with the slightest name for itself isn't exploited these days? Or at least attempted.\\nA whole other level of sadness though\\, is this forced female\/multicultural\/political correct agenda this movie blatantly displays - yeah we get it; all white men are evil\\, and if you're a white male\\, and not ashamed of yourself yet\\, then this movie will make another radical attempt to make you feel so. All while celebrating animal freedom\\, vegetarianism\\, and empowered woman at the same time.\\nStar Wars just used to be great and fun action adventure movies\\, that most people agreed were awesome. Not this demographically calculated soullessness with hidden political agendas.","true":true}
