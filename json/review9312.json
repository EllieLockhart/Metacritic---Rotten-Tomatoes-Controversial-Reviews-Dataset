Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Gave a 1+1\/2 to make my score count to the average\\, personally believe it deserves less. When a watched it I first thought it was visually spectacular\\, with awkward humour that missed several times. This quickly fades thought. Its full of plot holes\\, cliches and lacks anything new to star wars. Worst by far is the complete lack of story progression to anything meaningful\\, and its only progression is terminating any factor\\, previously established and\\, that required expansion on. Character arcs are inconsistent within the movie and its previous title. In short\\, its a good generic sci-fi movie with expensive visuals. If your invested in any previous star wars titles\\, not the movie for you.","true":true}
