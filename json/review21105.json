Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was so excited to see The Last Jedi but It\u2019s hugely disappointing\\, a big middle finger to Star Wars fans. It\u2019s not that people are impossible to please\\, we just expect \u201cgreat\u201d from our Star Wars. I would fire the director on down before i even planned the next one if I we\u2019re them. The crowd had no joy on their faces\\, they looked downtrodden and beat. Shame on you guys!","true":true}
