Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is full of surprises in the best way. I really enjoyed everything about this movie the characters and story is not predictable. The movie has it all humorous moments\\, dark moments\\, mystical moments\\, epic moments. It has all that and then some. The doors that have been opened in this film expands the Star Wars mythology beautifully.","true":true}
