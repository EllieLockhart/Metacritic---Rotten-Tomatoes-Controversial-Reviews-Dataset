Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If anything good can be said about Star Wars the Force awakens it was a setup of new brilliant characters The Last Jedi has the unequal pleasure to kill all of those characters literally castrating all of them and leaving nothing\\, the story is so bad I can't even really get into it without literally shooting myself featuring the slowest car chase type plot that you could ever contrived plot dead ends for two of the major characters having them meet up in the end with nothing accomplished on either end with our third protagonist caught up in some weird subterfuge with a rogue Admiral that no one with any sense would follow there orders or can possibly like\\, I left the theater with my ears and eyes bleeding\\, hard to believe this is a Star Wars film I guess this is where Star Wars crawled up the ear of some creature to die\\, this is the worst film I've seen since artificial intelligence and I thought that was a bad movie! Guess I was wrong\\, Star Wars The Last Jedi now has the pleasure of taking the cake as the worst movie ever","true":true}
