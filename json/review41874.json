Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is the most disrespectful film concerning its characters that I have every scene.  The opening scene shows the rebel Poe taunting a First order command ship.  He would have been blown away immediately if this had been Governor Tarkin.However\\, it becomes a farce telephone joke.  Luke\\, Yoda\\, Leia are all treated in a very poor way.  Kathleen Kennedy should be ashamed herself the way she is dismantling this franchise.  It is becoming \\\"Transformers\\\" with shoddy story telling and no regard for what went before.  A disappointment. A disgrace.","true":true}
