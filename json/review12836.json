Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't come back to the Star Wars Universe to watch all my favorite characters die off there was no reason for them to die at all they could have come back in the future movies and bit smaller players but no they close the doors on that and they close the door on this Fan","true":true}
