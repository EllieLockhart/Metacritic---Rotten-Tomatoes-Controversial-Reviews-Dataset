Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Abysmal. Horribly written. Star Wars is dead to me. I couldn't care less about the last installment. There is nowhere it can go or any characters that even matter to end a 9 movie saga in any compelling way now. I have seen fan fiction better written than this. Literally\\, nothing happens that any of the characters were required to be there for. The story is an excuse for scenes to happen instead of the other way around. I'm so depressed at how bad this movie is.","true":true}
