Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is my first post on RT but I just had to vent...\\n\\nBOTTOM LINE: It is a SJW  themed nightmare dressed up with flashy effects. I expect that from Disney\/Hollywood but even worse\\, they seek to tear down the fabric of the very ethos underpinning of Star Wars and the Jedi. Sad.\\n\\nWHAT has Disney done to my beloved Star Wars! I thought the blatant liberal-progressive undercurrent in A Force Awakens was bad but this time they didn't even bother trying to hide the Leftist social engineering message - \\\"men\\, wealth\\, organized religion\\, history\\, honor\\, tradition\\, etc. BAD - women GOOD\\\". \\n\\nIs it too much to ask that The Left in Hollywood leave us any American icons without tearing them down to be replaced with progressive propaganda? To quote Mark Hamill's remark regarding the degrading of his beloved character; \\\"I pretty much fundamentally disagree with every choice you've made for this character.\\\"\\n\\nRian Johnson your writing is incoherent as it is disrespectful to the SW franchise. \\n\\nThat said\\, it was visually entertaining as always.","true":true}
