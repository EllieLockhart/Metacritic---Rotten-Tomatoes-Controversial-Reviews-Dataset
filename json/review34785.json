Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The director of this film clearly had no intention of adding to the star wars universe but instead wanted to make their own film with their own ideas. The amount of plot holes and non-linking random elements thrown just make this feel like a mess. Force Awakens did a good job of setting up a new new trilogy but Jedi uses no of these plot points well. Instead wanting to harp on about how being a hero is wrong.","true":true}
