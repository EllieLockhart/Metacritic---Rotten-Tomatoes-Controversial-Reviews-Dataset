Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible direction and story telling make this a hard film to sit through. The plot(s) felt bolted on in post production with the film lacking any sort of flow or continuity. Entire plot mechanisms fail to feel weighty enough to justify the characters' reactions and most of those characters (outside of Luke\\, Kylo\\, and Rey) contribute absolutely nothing anyways. First Star Wars film in the franchise to make me not look forward to the next movie.","true":true}
