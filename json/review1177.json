Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A PC nightmare that continues to diminish the franchise.  This film is a complete PC joke if you are a real fan of Star Wars this will make you vomit.  The entire film seems to be written by middle school girls to promote \\\"girls can do anything boys can only better\\\".  The original Star Wars preached that to be a Jedi you need to control your emotions and not let hate rule your thoughts this one preaches the opposite.","true":true}
