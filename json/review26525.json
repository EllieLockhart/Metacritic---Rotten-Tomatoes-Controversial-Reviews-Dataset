Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Of the best Star Wars films \\, it added so many layers and expectations that brought you up and down . With a great ending . My only let down wasn\u2019t seeing Snoke\u2019s backround and how he achieved such power after all the most powerful Jedi and Sith are dead . Wasn\u2019t very fair to the audience . Enjoyed the movie and will see again ","true":true}
