Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Killing Snoke was a bad idea. We don't even know\\, who he is. Besides that you can't tell me that one of the powerful sithlords ever won't recognise the turning lightsaber beside him. I also would love to see Kylo Ren turning back to the light side. Oh and I think Rey and Kylo Ren\/Ben Solo would be a wonderful couple.","true":true}
