Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Could possibly be the biggest disappointment of my life. I love Star Wars\\, and I was even a fan of the force awakens. But last Jedi is complete garbage. The corny Disney humor has gotten out of hand and the way they have completely distorted the use of the force is honestly insulting. Disney is completely ruining this franchise for me and I couldn't be more upset about it.","true":true}
