Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"On the surface this movie can upset hard core Star Wars fans. Especially if they\u2019re not willing to see what and who this trilogy is really about. At its heart this film is about Rey and Kylo Ren. It\u2019s about good vs evil\\, the resistance vs the first order. It\u2019s not about Luke or Leia. It\u2019s not about the original trilogy. It works to capture some of that but it turns everything on its head. There were so many fan theories out there I don\u2019t think this film ever had a chance to make everyone happy. Those theories are ultimately based on what people wanted to see. But ultimately it all comes back to Rey and Kylo. The film worked hard to further develop those characters and all others get the standard Star Wars character treatment. The movie surprised me a lot. It did a lot of things I never thought it would do which further made it more interesting to watch. There\u2019s a lot more to the movie than on its surface. To me it deserves multiple viewings.
