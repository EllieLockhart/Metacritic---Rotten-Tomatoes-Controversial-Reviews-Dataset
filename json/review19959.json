Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was fun while it lasted.  This movie could be the Jar Jar Binks of the Disney era. In short it sucks! But not only does it suck! They killed enough characters and destroyed enough storylines\\, they effectively wrecked the next movie too.\\n\\nI wanted to like it\\, hell\\, I wanted to love it\\, but I can't be it sucked big ones.","true":true}
