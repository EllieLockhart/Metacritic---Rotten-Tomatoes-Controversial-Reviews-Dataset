Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is one of if not the best Star Wars movies since the original trilogy.  Can you find faults in the movie?  Sure you can\\, but what movie doesn't have faults?   I am someone who was very young when A New Hope came out and was obsessed with the originals.   I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  This and The Force Awakens make up for suffering through the prequels.","true":true}
