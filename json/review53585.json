Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic.  I'm laughing at the comments in the audience reviews about the people who say \\\"Rian Johnson ruined my childhood\\\" or \\\"ruined my year.\\\"  Really?  He did that?  \\nThe Last Jedi is not perfect\\, but it it's successes far outweigh it's detriments.  It's a little long\\, there's a side plot that is a little problematic and ultimately boils down to \\\"we'd all have saved a bunch of time if someone would communicate.\\\"  But other than that it's hugely emotionally satisfying and has plenty of jaw dropping moments and loads of symbolism splashed against beautiful cinematography. \\n\\nIf you read through the negative reviews\\, it basically boils down to die hards who can't \\\"let go\\\" of the past.  Ironically\\, that's precisely the entire plot of this movie.  The past is done.  Burn it to the ground.  Look ahead to a new era.","true":true}
