Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Could have been so much better. Forced comedy that wasn't needed and after waiting decades to get Luke Skywalker back his story line was terribly weak.  They took our childhood hero and turned him to a distant memory.  They basically portray him as a coward and hadn't learned anything in all these years.  Rey doesn't even train with Luke.  There could've have been an ending where Luke breaks out the his old green lightsaber and sets out to protect the galaxy one last time while also helping Rey find her place but that sadly was not the case.  This was a wasted opportunity to make a Star Wars that could have rivaled Empire Strikes Back but it's not.","true":true}
