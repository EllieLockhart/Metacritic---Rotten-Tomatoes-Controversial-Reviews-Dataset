Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was an extreme disappointment for what could've been. It was one of the most visually stunning Star Wars movies to-date\\, but\\, sadly\\, that could not save it from its own storyline\\, bad jokes\\, and gaping plot holes. Easily the worst Star Wars ever made and I would strongly support stripping it from cannon and remaking this movie (or entire trilogy for that matter).","true":true}
