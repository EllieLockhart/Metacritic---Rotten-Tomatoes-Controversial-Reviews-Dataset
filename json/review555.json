Things soon take a turn for the worst however....\r\rIt's difficult to play Until Dawn without making immediate comparisons to Quantic Dreams titles Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls. Thankfully this effort from SuperMassive Games is more interesting than either of those titles but your opinion of the game will still hinge greatly on just how interactive you expect want your games to be. The story itself\\, while a little out there\\, is relatively entertaining and the excellent cast (that includes Hayden Panettiere and Rami Malek) make a good job with the script. As the player you can't change the overall direction this story takes but your decision and actions\\, or lack thereof\\, decide how the characters react to each other and ultimately who lives and dies.\r\rUnfortunately\\, from a gameplay perspective\\, Until Dawn is far less successful. A large portion of the game is made up of wandering around (you can't even run!!) until you see a highlighted object that you can interact with. Occasionally you'll have to react quickly to certain events but this is always handled by QTE sequences in which you again just press buttons as prompted. A bit of editing to allow the important decisions to be made more frequently certainly wouldn\u2019t have gone amiss.\r\rThese type of \\\"interactive movies\\\" continue to show promise but is there any reason the gameplay can't be enjoyable as well?\u2026 Expand","true":true}
