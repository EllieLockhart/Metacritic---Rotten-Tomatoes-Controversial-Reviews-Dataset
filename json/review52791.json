{"101487":101379,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A long time ago\\, I walked through the ruins of Ephesus.  Not knowing much about this ancient city\\, the historian\\, before passing on her knowledge\\, stated that without knowing the history of the people who lived here\\, the culture\\, the life that once fueled this city\\, these ruins would mean nothing to a passer-by. Without context buildings are just buildings.  Without struggle\\, people are just people.  \\n\\nThis is how I feel about Star Wars 8.  Though most of us know the last gen characters (who with great personal satisfaction\\, carry this new trilogy onward) I feel like we are missing context to this story\\, There is no main underlying theme that pushes the story forward.  The world\\, the politics\\, the motives of the new characters are generalized.  What is either side really fighting for?  Yes\\, the resistance\/New Republic is being attacked\\, buy why?  If the First Order claims they wish to bring Order\\, then show us the Disorder to give the audience context. If its Disney objective to fill in the contextual gaps through books\\, comics\\, video games and cartoons to make an extra buck\\, it makes for really shitty film-making. This is what is missing from this new trilogy\\, context...   The humor is there\\, the new character chemistry is there\\, but the villians and heroes are black and white.  I feel like we are watching the same story again while throwing in a lightsaber and  a few space battles to keep us entertained.    \\n\\nDarth Vader died at the end of Return of the Jedi\\, he found redemption through the sacrifical choice of his son to not give into darkness. END OF STORY. This trilogy is going over the same ground while introducing characters that are pointless\\, lack any depth - just to give us a slight spin on the previous story. Kylo is following the same path as Anakin (been there done that) Snoke comes out of nowhere (no link to the entire series\\, dies in the middle of the film\\, no backstory)\\, Luke passes nothing along to Rey (almost pointless sequence)\\,  Rey isn't even a Skywalker and continues to be a Mary Sue(thought this entire story was about the struggles of the Skywalker family)\\, the other characters are there for comic relief or filler\\, and the Luke\/Kylo fallout goes against Luke's character (I agree with Mark Hamill on this). \\n\\nThe Force Awakens was a decent starting point\\, even if it followed an old formula.  I was expecting more out of the second film\\, more context on why this galaxy continues to fight the same old battles and what it will take to finally bring balance.  What more has this episode added to the story?  At this point\\, I would have rather just keep my Star Wars story starting with a New Hope and ending with Return of the Jedi.  The prequels had a lot of context\\, but Anakin''s unlikeable character\\, philosphical love story and choice to follow a darker path lacked depth (I turned to the dark side because I had a bad dream... Come on...).  First rule in film school\\, show don't tell.     And now this New Trilogy lacks context\\, the story hasn't evolved toward something new and your killing off my  favorite last gen characters\\, sacrificing all they fought for and won to give the new characters a chance to shine. Disney\\, your looking to surprise us instead of digging deeper\\, listening to fan feedback\\, creating a cohesive story that bring all these films together.   In this day in age\\, its hard to come up with a new idea when a bunch of passionate fans have already blogged it.  Instead\\, you have Luke throw Anakin's lightsaber\\, which has a whole lot of context\\, behind him like it meant nothing.  This whole new Trilogy could have been based on Luke's decision in Empire Strikes Back to help his friends rather than heed Yoda's advice about destroying everything they have fought for if he left now\\, that there is another if you fail.... That the lightsaber Rey gave you reminded you of that decision.  But yeah\\, hell with context....          \\n\\nAs much as I would like to blame Disney for their lack of vision (beyond making money)\\, I blame George Lucas for selling out to the evil empire.  Ironic isn't it? George\\, you're not a great Director or Speech Writer\\, but you had great\\, maticulous\\, fresh ideas.  You always seemed to hire the right people to execute your vision.  This was your strength during your prime... You were a very Creative Producer\\, wish you realized this and were still involved in that regard.  \\n\\nAnyways... Good popcorn flick\\, awesome lightsaber battle\\, another hero bites the dust.","true":true}
