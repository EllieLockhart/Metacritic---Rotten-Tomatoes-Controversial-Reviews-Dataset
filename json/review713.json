Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An amazing Star Wars installment. People complaining about Luke's arc weren't paying attention to the end. Only 4.5 stars because there is a fairly pointless 30-45 minutes subplot that drags the film down. However\\, the main arcs\\, action\\, performances\\, set pieces\\, etc are all first class. I'm excited to see where they take Episode IX.","true":true}
