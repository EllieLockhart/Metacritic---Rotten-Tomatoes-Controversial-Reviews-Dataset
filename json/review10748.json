Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Half star reviews count. People analysing the score are only counting the stars associated with the OPTIONAL reviews. Like the one you're reading now.\\n\\nIf you just rate the film and leave the review box empty your score is still counted. \\n\\nIt's not a conspiracy.\\n\\nPosting the same essay every day though. That's a bit shady.\\n\\nAlso\\, this movie sucks.","true":true}
