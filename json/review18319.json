Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this movie was amazing. Mostly serious but interspersed with lighthearted moments that made the audience laugh\\, like Rey telling Kylo to put a shirt on and the porg barbecue scene. Had plenty of scenes in that did get me in the feels like Rey and Kylo reaching out to touch hands. It had scenes that got me hyped like the Kylo and Rey fighting back to back scene. I storyline was unpredictable which was great. The main characters seemed multidimensional enough for me\\, I'm guessing those that claim otherwise didn't feel the romance and tension between Kylo and Rey. Rey is a strong female lead: she is this franchise's first ever female jedi\\, a fighter unlike princess Leia; she is sensitive enough to feel for Kylo and to want to save him\\, and she is strong enough to resist Kylo's requests that she join him. Where on the galaxy have we had a female character try to save a male character like Rey tried to save Kylo? \\n\\nRey is even stronger than Princess Leia was. I'm guessing most of the disgruntled fans must be part of an older generation and probably less accepting of change. Also those fans that are suggesting alternate plots don't realise that their alternate plots have flaws in them too.","true":true}
