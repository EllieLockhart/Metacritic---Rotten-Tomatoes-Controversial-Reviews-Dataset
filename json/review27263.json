Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Only die hard super Star Wars fans would even think this movie is someone enjoyable. By far the worst Star Wars movie in the entire saga on many different levels. Disney has now destroyed the Star Wars franchise with this piece.","true":true}
