Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After The Force Awakens I wasn't sure Rian Johnson could spin a story that would work. Boy was I wrong. The Last Jedi is fantastic. Full of great visuals and fantastic writing. It's simply amazing.","true":true}
