Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's rubbish. The actual plot literally brings everything to a halt and therefore the characters seemingly have nothing to do but but time. The whole middle 3rd is literally pointless. Just an excuse for a plot device but they don't end up using what Finn finds on his journey anyway. Star Wars movie aside\\, this was still a poorly crafted movie.","true":true}
