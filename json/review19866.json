Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was beautiful to watch. That's it. It's not Star Wars. I did not recognize it. I wanted see my childhood hero Luke but instead they gave me a second rate version. Felt like Thor 3 with all the jokes. Silly plot\\, FO chasing resistance ships for 2 hours\\, that's the plot guys! So much for galaxy wide conflict. Not excited for the 9th.","true":true}
