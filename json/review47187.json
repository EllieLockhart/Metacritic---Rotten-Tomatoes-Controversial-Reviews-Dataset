Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What an amaizing movie and fresh take on inner conflict\\, true and realistic stakes and the awakened Force finally utilized! Episode 7 wasn't lying with its title!","true":true}
