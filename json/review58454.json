Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All of these negative reviews are nonsense - this is a great movie. The best Star Wars movie since Empire. It\u2019s definitely a huge improvement over Force Awakens. I\u2019m a huge Star Wars fan. I\u2019ve watched all of the movies\\, read the majority of the canon book\/comics and some of the legends stuff\\, and played some of the video games. It was super entertaining\\, funny at times\\, engaging\\, etc. if you\u2019re a true fan\\, chances are you\u2019ll love this movie. I\u2019m going to see it a few more times at least.","true":true}
