Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Whilst highly entertaining from start to finish it was about as deep as Luke's X-fighter and the plot as transparent as the waters under which it was submerged. \\nWeak characters play it out in series of plain silly story arcs and it's no wonder the Rebels are diminishing in numbers quicker than real Republicans when they embark on certain suicide missions at every available opportunity.\\nRei comes across as more of an intergalactic Mary Poppins than a bad ass Jedi and once again charmless Finn failed to exude anything other a smarmy \\\"Ive got a 3 picture\\\" smugness and even more cheesy than his schtick in TFA.","true":true}
