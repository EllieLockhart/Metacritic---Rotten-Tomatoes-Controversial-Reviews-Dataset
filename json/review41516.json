Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is beyond salvation!  In fact\\, there is nothing to salvage. \\nI thought the \\\"haters\\\" of this movie were just pedantic fanboys... I was WRONG!  I apologise for my erroneous assumptions. This movie is INDEED a peace of crap!  From the cringe-worthy\\, self-aware humour to the debasement of Luke Skywalker. From Porgs and Purple-hair to Rose-Rose Binks. \\nI can't even express how BAD this movie is.\\n\\nSure\\, Phantom Menace wasn't;t great\\, but at least they had Darth Maul\\, podracers\\,  double-bladed lightsabers\\, Duel of Fates. \\nLast Jedi had literally nothing to redeem it.\\n\\nAlso\\, there is no way that the 49% audience rating is real!","true":true}
