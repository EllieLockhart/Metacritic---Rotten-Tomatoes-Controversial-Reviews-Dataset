Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Jedi\\\" adds complexity to otherwise flat villains while expanding the mythology of the force\\, offering new\\, cute\\, aliens\\, and boasting dazzling settings that are sure to preserve the film's place in our collections.","true":true}
