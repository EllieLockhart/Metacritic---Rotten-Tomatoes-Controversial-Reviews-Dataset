Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS AHEAD\\, YOU'VE BEEN WARNED. With the new year closing another Star Wars film comes with\\, the much anticipated Episode VIII\\, and the new trilogy is starting to fall apart. Far too many problem with the story and tone. The filmmakers added jokes that are just cringe worthy. The characters of Snoke and Captain Phasma were not well explored in the last film and this film would've been the time to expand their characters\\, but instead they have little screen time and are killed off. There are some points of just pure logic breaking\\, like how do you breath in space? Seriously\\, human characters with no masks are openly breathing in space. Mark Hamil does a fine job but it looks like his time in the franchise is also done since his dissipated into the air. Fin almost dies but in a heroic way which would've been great for his character but is instead saved by a character we barley know or care about. There's an added scene towards the end of the film that was odd in tone and totally unnecessary. There's other problems in directing\\, editing\\, and tone too many to go through. \\\"Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi\\\" has taken a nasty stumble in the new trilogy and if it continues in that direction you may not see episodes 10-12.","true":true}
