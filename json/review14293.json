Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I got my rotten tomatoes account because of this film. While visually beautiful\\, musically pleasing\\, and great sound effects\\, that is about it. Character development was a waste\\, there are numerous plot holes\\, and Disney has tried very hard to push both forced humor and social agendas. Ive never rated a film before\\, but this was bad. Disney has its clutches around some of the best franchises in the history of entertainment\\, but if TLJ is any indication\\, we can expect those franchises to die mediocre\\, sloppy\\, joke ridden\\, merchandise driven\\, money grubbing\\, visually impressive deaths.","true":true}
