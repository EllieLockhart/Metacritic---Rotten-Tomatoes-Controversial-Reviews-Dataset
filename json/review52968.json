Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Are spoilers allowed in these ratings? Whatever. So\\, I don't know where to begin. As someone with no formal directorial\/writing education; I believe I could've crafted a better film. At 250 million\\, you'd think the people in charge would have some process of editing out the nonsensical  nonsense. I disliked this movis so much\\, I created an account just leave thus review. Don't get me wrong\\, I disliked Force Awakens\\, but this one..just...arg! I...hate.....Kylo Ren. He's an absolute buffoon of a villain. This floppy-eared\\, petulant child is supposed to strike fear? He should've never removed his helmet. MY only hope for an actual antagonist was Snoke\\, and..well..just watch the film to see what happens Snoke\\, This powerful\\, force lightning bad-ass. So far\\, Rogue One\\, is the only decent Disney Star Wards film. The Characters in RO were mature\\,believe and made logical decisions. The automatons in this flick were absolutely brain-dead.","true":true}
