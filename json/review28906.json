Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really didn't deliver a lot of what Star Wars fans love.  It lacked in lightsaber battles\\, it hardly addressed Rey's parent's\\, the editing really didn't flow like Episode 7\\, and there was too much going on........  Plus this was the only Star Wars movie where someone almost loses a battle because their ship runs out of gas.  LMAO","true":true}
