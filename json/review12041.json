Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely\\, wholeheartedly believe that I and many others saw a completely different movie than a lot of people. I have seen every single Star Wars movie at least 10 times\\, including the newest ones. This was an incredible movie that I am so stoked to see at least another 9 times because of its beautiful visual design\\, perfect framework for a movie with no true beginning and no true ending\\, with some amazing performances all around","true":true}
