Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie throws away the sum total of the seven movies that came before it.  If Lucas had made this in 1977\\, there'd never be an empire strikes back.  It really is terrible\\, for a variety of reasons - not the least of which is the cringy levels of social commentary.  Many of the plots do not matter at all and are simply filler\\, beloved characters are pointlessly killed off and replaced with new characters we're told to care about but not given a reason to care about.\\n\\n\\\"Show\\, don't tell\\\" is apparently not in the writer-director's vocabulary.  This is a painful movie to endure.  Buyer beware.","true":true}
