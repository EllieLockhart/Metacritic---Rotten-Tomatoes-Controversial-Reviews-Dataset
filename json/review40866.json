Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie contradicts itself frequently\\, and so delivers a message as confusing as its plotholes.\\n\\nIs self sacrifice a positive thing?

Totally... except when for the Jedi order continuing and those pesky holy texts that we destroyed earlier.\\nIs morality grey? Totally... except when Leia wants to talk about the light.\\n\\n'Killing the past' mainly seems to involve the abrasive dismantling of core concepts of the old movies. \\n\\nHoldo frustrated me.","true":true}
