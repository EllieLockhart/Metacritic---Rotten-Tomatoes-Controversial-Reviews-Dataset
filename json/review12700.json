Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I couldn't ignore the giant holes in the plot and worldbuilding.  Most of the performances felt like the characters were just going through the motions.  The juvenile and inappropriately timed attempts at humor broke my immersion from the start\\, and continued to throughout. The whole enterprise was a complete slog for me to sit through. By the time the movie got to what should have been some cool scenes\\, I was so checked out that I didn't care or feel anything.","true":true}
