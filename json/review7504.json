Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Every chance they had to make this a decent movie\\, they fumbled and failed. The director essentially threw out any continuity built up by its predecessor\\, made drastic changes to all understanding of the force through past films\\, threw away chances for character development of major characters\\, added in SJW themes\\, and ruined the legacy and character of Luke Skywalker. This movie makes me angry\\, and as we all know: anger leads to hate\\, and hate leads to suffering. This movie has caused too much suffering..","true":true}
