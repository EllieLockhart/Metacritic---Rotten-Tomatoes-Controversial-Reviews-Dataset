Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was just slightly better than Episode 9. The only interesting storyline was Luke\u2018s. He acted out of character\\, but it felt natural\\, as he was alone on an island for a very long time. Ideally he wouldn't have thrown his dad's lightsaber away\\, but just dropped it. That would have been way better. For some stupid reason\\, they cut a very important scene out of the movie. Luke heartbroken by the fact\\, that his best friend was killed by his own son. That was a beautiful scene. Mark Hamill was generally amazing in this movie. He gives an amazing performance in a fine movie. The other storylines were just very poorly written\\, handled and managed. Just very boring stuff. I hate\\, that they didn't kill of Finn. How sad would it have been\\, if Finn sacrificed himself. Rey and him wouldn't have seen each other again\\, like Rey promised. That would have been a great ending to his arc. But instead he got saved by Rose. By an action\\, that should have killed both of them. And then she says the single worst line ever. And an awkward kiss. Decent all in all.","true":true}
