Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney ruined Star Wars :( They took everything holy to a Star Wars fanboy and throw it away. This should have been a movie where Luke comes back and teaches Rey\\, but no\\, because Rey is a woman she has to succeed in everything on first attempt. So pathetic\\, why can't she grow and learn how to be a Jedi. I will not ever see another Star Wars movie. RIP SW. Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson should be ashamed.","true":true}
