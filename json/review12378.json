Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I appreciate that they are going in a different direction. All things must end\/change eventually. The film was extremely well shot\\, tasteful CGI\\, excellent story-telling\\, and incredibly original. There was a sub-plot here and there that felt shoe-horned in; but overall this is my new favorite Star Wars film while previously it was Empire. As long as you enter the film fully expecting it to not cater to the olden ways of Star Wars films you will exit happily. Enjoy it for what it is; the dawn of a new day in the realm that we hold so dear to our hearts.","true":true}
