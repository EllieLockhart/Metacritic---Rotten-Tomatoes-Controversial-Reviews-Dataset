Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great fun but destroying Luke as a Character was a poor decision. Those story arcs are 40 years old and to sell out the franchise so that they can position new charaters is cheap;   It's so out of step with what's gone before its painful to watch. Many will enjoy it but I mostly found it annoying. Its sad  that spin off films (RogueOne) are setting the pace. Lazy Disney cartoon characters wont cut it","true":true}
