Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Took everything wonderful from the original trilogy (and even the prequels - there was some good there!) and threw it in the garbage. Why even call it a Star Wars movie at all?","true":true}
