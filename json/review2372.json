Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At times this movie has fast paced action and other times slow and confusing story. The writer\/director tried to add humor and plot twists that missed the mark. And some new characters weren\u2019t needed or developed very well.","true":true}
