Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson delivers a beautiful though very flawed entry in the Star Wars franchise. The effects and cinematography are the only good things about this film\\, the plot is pathetic with a stupid forced chase narrative\\, the film is inconsistent with all the previous films including and especially Ep7. Characters are made in to joke versions of themselves\\, with the obvious and unneeded destruction of Luke's character. Scenes with poor delivery of lines have been left in. It could have been so much more if anyone with any sense had taken control at any point. This film is possibly the worst sequel in a franchise ever. It is awful. Ep9 will be interesting just to see if anyone can undo this mess but I will never pay Disney willingly again.","true":true}
