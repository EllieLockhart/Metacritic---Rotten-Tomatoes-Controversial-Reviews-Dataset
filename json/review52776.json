Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Almost unwatchable. Haven\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2 1\/2(TM)t been able to see solo and won\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2 1\/2(TM)t watch the 9th movie because of this terrible mess of a movie. And I aatnin live to watch all of the other Star Wars movies. Really sad to see how pathetic a wonderful franchise can get.","true":true}
