Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There's not much to say that hasn't already been said about this movie.  Is it horrible?  No\\, absolutely not.  Did it feel like Star Wars?  It did at times\\, and those moments make The Last Jedi soar...But there's just not enough of that.  What's left is a film that  I think spends too much time and effort trying to shock its audience than it does growing the saga at hand\\, and then trying to over correct with too familiar visuals that serve to remind us we're watching Star Wars\\, when we shouldn't have to be reminded.","true":true}
