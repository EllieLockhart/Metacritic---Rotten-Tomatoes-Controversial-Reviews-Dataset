Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just read a professional review trying to justify this piece of junk addition to Star Wars by saying everyone must think it is great if it has such a big box office weekend. The writer\/director obviously did a great job the review stated because how popular the film is. What are these people smoking? It has a huge box office because it is Star Wars and we have been waiting over 30 years for this. Not because it was good.","true":true}
