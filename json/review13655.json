Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If I could give this film a 0\\, I most certainly would.\\n\\nRian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy gave the finger to all Star Wars fans and Lucas himself. The writing\\, pacing\\, and character development actually made me wish the First Order obliterated everyone and ruled the galaxy. Why are they portrayed as being completely incompetent?? The story gives you no reason to fear them\\, especially General Hux.\\n\\nThe ENTIRE (3 hour) movie is undercut by horrible one-liners\\, stupid jokes\\, \\\"gotcha\\\" moments\\, bb-8\\, anti-white male sentiments\\, and even anti-capitalism sentiments which is hilarious because without capitalism this movie wouldn't be possible... \\n\\nTo Hell with you Rian Johnson... You didn't just stick to what made Star Wars great... in fact\\, you took THE WORST parts of all Star Wars films and combined them into Episode 8.","true":true}
