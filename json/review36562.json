Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie had not substance\\, most of the movie was unneeded and did nothing for the story. Not that there was much of a story. The amount of wasted potential is horrifying and the fact that people enjoyed it is sad. From a movie point of view\\, the characters were 1D the story was a stretch at best and as a whole forgettable.\\nRayn Johnson was acting like a middle school girl along with everyone at Disney and Lucas studios\\, only middle schoolers are petty enough to spit in the face of their supports and expect not backlash.","true":true}
