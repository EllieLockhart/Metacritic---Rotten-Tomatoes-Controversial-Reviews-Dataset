Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wost Star Wars movie! It completely mocked and made fun of the whole culture of Star Wars. I guess Disney truly has slapped their slogan of \\\"where the magic happens\\\" cause we got flying leia and a joke and mockery of the MAIN character Luke who may i remind you Disney this is still a SKYWALKER SAGA. Force Awakens had promise and The Last Jedi ruined Star Wars.","true":true}
