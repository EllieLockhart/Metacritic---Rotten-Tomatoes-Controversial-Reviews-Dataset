Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Articles have been touting about how much control Rian Johnson had\\, but this movie felt like it was made by committee. It has too many endings and an expansive scene in the middle that feels like it came out of the Prequel Trilogy. There are scenes that feel like cheap fan service with no true resonance. Like some executives sat in a room trying to figure out what the fanfiction people would love to see.\\n\\nThis overstuffed movie does have many inspired scenes\\, a plethora of talent\\, and some of the self aware humor that played really well. It could have been great if they had streamlined it.","true":true}
