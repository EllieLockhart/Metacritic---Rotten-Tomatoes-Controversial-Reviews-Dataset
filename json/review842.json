Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An exciting\\, enrapturing movie. Love the focus on the women in the rebooted series. Feels like a breath of fresh air. TLJ captures Rey and Kylo's struggles superbly. This is a Star Wars movie that delivers a message so sorely needed today\\, that hope can be found even in the bleakest of circumstances.","true":true}
