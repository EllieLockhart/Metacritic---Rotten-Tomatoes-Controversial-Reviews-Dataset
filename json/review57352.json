Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie just made me sad. STORY LINE STORY LINE STORY LINE Stick to the basics and you won't go wrong. CGI will only get you so far. And enough with pushing a political agenda (ALL men bad\\, dumb or dead) I dont know weather they realize it\\, but alienating half their viewership(maybe more seeing as its a SW movie) is not the way to go. The same although more extreme thing happened in Ghostbusters.\\n1. The whole casino story line with Finn and Rose was like a hamster on a wheel\\, going nowhere very quickly.\\n2. We get no insight into the BIG BAD\\, snoke. Instead the bad guy who got owned in the last movie by someone who was NEVER trained in the force takes his place (I just cant wait for what he will do next)*sarcasm.\\n3. Rose is Jar jar binks.\\n4. WTF princess Leia\\nThe fact that critics are giving this a thumbs up just shows how superficial they are. Superficially paying tribute to past movies via a puppet yoda and an old clip of the princess while failing to give Luke effing Skywalker a proper story line that was consistent with his character(believing in the good in people).","true":true}
