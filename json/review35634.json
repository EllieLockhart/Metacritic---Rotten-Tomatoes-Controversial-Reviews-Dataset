Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a movie about moving on from mistakes and past failures. It's a movie that challeged how I view my heroes and who's really a good guy and who's really a good guy. The film was even better after the second viewing as I was able to let go of my preconceived notions of what I felt the movie should be. Rian Johnson made a great movie and Daisy\\, Mark\\, Carrie\\, John\\, and Oscar gave us a well acted movie.","true":true}
