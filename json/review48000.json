Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While no movie since the original Star Wars theatrical release has had the same level of wow-factor\\, this episode does not disappoint. The shift to primarily female hero\u2019s (and some villains) fits with the shift in the story line perfectly. Hamill\u2019s\\, Luke Skywalker was great\\, unexpectedly so. And Carrie Fisher\u2019s\\, Princess Leia was great too\\, but a bit distracting since we know it had to be back-fit into the plot. The action is great but it\u2019s not why you are compelled to watch. The story is layered with subplots and stories that really makes it interesting. The only part I didn\u2019t love was the attempts at cutesy humor. If you\u2019re a fan go see it. You know you want to. ","true":true}
