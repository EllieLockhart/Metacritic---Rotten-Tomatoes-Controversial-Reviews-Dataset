Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Possibly the worst movie in the Star Wars franchise including the horrible TV special. The acting was acceptable but the story\\, pacing\\, direction\\, everything except the special effects honestly\\, were terrible. Unless you are a diehard fan save yourself some time and pain and skip this. If I could I would give it zero stars. I do not know a single Star Wars fan that liked this movie.","true":true}
