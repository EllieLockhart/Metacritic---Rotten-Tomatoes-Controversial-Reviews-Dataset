Great replayability and very flexible gameplay not to mention the amazing difficulty modifiers which change up things like ammo\\, enemy pattern and behaviour etc.\rDrool worthy visuals and F-in-amazing audio design.\rGreat voice acting and performances from the cast and crew.\rAnd a very nice complex story which just keeps on going and giving. really good writing. the structure of the game is a bit odd\\, but serves the story and more importantly the narration really well.\rI am glad nd had the guts to do this game and commit so hard to what they wanted to do with it.\rIt really shines for me personally. Highly recommended to everyone who has played and liked the first game. Tlou2 really tops the original in every way.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
