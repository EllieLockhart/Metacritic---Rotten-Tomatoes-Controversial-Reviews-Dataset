Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Avoided all trailers and spoilers before watching. Was absolutely blown away in theaters. Strongest Star Wars movie\\, since ep5 if not period. People are hurting over some losses\\, and I get that. I choose not to rate based on those feelings\\, though others certainly can. It's probably healthy for all of us to try to let go so that the story can grow.","true":true}
