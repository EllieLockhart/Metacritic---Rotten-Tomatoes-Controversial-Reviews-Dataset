Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked the movie and was throughly entertained in the moment. However\\, there were some flaws. The type of humor used at times seemed out of place for a Star Wars movie\\, even if the jokes did make me laugh. A whole side plot that proved fruitless. The Last Jedi also slammed the door on questions raised by The Force Awakens that left you excited for the next film. Those questions could have been explored better rather than dismissed. On a positive note it had great action sequences and visuals. Some people don't like the character arcs\\, but I think they worked. The film was also more original than the Force Awakens. Overall\\, the movie isn't a home run as critics would have you believe. However\\, it is far from worth the level of criticism viewers are giving it. I think a lot of how this film will fit in the grand scheme of the franchise hinges on the direction episode IX takes. The next film could enhance The Last Jedi's place in the canon or render it pointless. Time will tell\\, but I certainly hope for the former.","true":true}
