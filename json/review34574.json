Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The biggest sin of this movie (and the TFA's as well) - beside the many other issues - is that they totally and utterly destroyed Luke's character. To say that Luke considered killing Ben while he was sleeping is closely the biggest possible insult they could have done to Luke - and the original trilogy. Disney stabbed Star Wars right in the heart in a way that is beyond all comprehension... I still can't believe they did this.","true":true}
