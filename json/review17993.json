Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think that Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a better movie when compared to Star Wars: The Force Awakens. The Force Awakens was too similar to A New Hope by George Lucas. This movie feels different in a good way. It might be because I'm kind of a fanboy\\, but this film is very satisfying. It was so nice to see Mark Hamill on screen. He was fantastic in this movie. Just like the last movie\\, Daisy Ridley and John Boyega are very good in The Last Jedi. The action is spectacular and the porgs are adorable. However\\, some characters aren't good like Rose. I did not like her as a character. They also wasted characters that had so much potential. However\\, the ending of this movie is very satisfying and I cannot wait for the final chapter of this trilogy.","true":true}
