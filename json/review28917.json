Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really disappointed in this one\\, had some awesome moments (that silent one for sure) but it mostly felt very all over the place and like episode 5 and 6 combined. barely any major gun fights\\, too many moments ruined by tastless comedy and one liners\\, some pretty bad cgi on that force ghost (not naming for sake of spoilers) and overall unconvincing story and predictable sequences. Rough One was way better if you think this was ever gonna top it. ","true":true}
