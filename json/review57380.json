Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie's creators made a solid effort to keep its audience guessing and asking \\\"WTF\\\" every few minutes\\, and in that effort it succeeds greatly.  You just had NO idea what was going to happen next or where the story might take you until it was over\\, leaving you feeling like a kid at Christmas with too many presents.  How many of those nice smaller presents did you forget because big huge ones came just moments later?  And again...and again...  \\nA couple of plot holes aside\\, and a gag or two that just didn't work and feel incredibly awkward\\, this should go down as one of the more interesting outings in Star Wars history.  It was very distinctive in execution even if the characters seemed to constantly do things you would never expect.  Some of that was misdirection and some of it just left you questioning everything you thought you knew about those characters.  \\nThis was a fun outing with a little something for everyone\\, a unique feel to a familiar setting\\, and a lot more surprises than the viewer may have signed up for\\, partially due to a VERY busy script and partially due to an exceptionally long run time.","true":true}
