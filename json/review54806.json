Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thoroughly enjoyed it\\, I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews\\, especially considering how the movie managed to get an applause from the theater I viewed it in.\\n\\nAnyway\\, I had a feeling that this wouldn't be a simple good vs evil narrative\\, and that the \\\"bad guy\\\" wasn't being bad for the sake of being bad. There's a romantic energy that I've never seen in a Star Wars movie before\\, it's darker and more intense. It also leads to one of the most satisfying twists I've seen in a long time\\, in any movie. There's a lot of unexpected\\, some expected\\, and one's heart may break a few times. \\n\\nThough I must admit\\, I did find a few flaws with the movie\\, as much as I had enjoyed it. There were bits of comedy that seemed extremely out of place\\, sort of forced (no pun intended) even. One of the narratives within the movie seemed a bit on the corny side\\, one of the twists was a bit of a letdown (but a relief\\, too\\, in a sense). \\n\\nSo\\, no\\, the movie isn't without faults\\, but it was extremely enjoyable. It delivered a rather unexpected but intense sort of romance\\, which led way to one of the most satisfying plot twists in the series. I say give it a chance before you draw conclusions from some of the tantrums thrown in the reviews.","true":true}
