Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is full of ambiguity\\, tension\\, and adventure. It is everything that makes SW great but then takes it in a new and exciting direction. Some people may not appreciate that this is about going in a new direction. The line between darkness and lightness is not as well defined and old and new alliances are shifted. The writing\\, the delivery and acting were worth it and I'd recommend it highly.","true":true}
