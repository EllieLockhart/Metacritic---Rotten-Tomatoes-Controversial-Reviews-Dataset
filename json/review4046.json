Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bravura filmmaking overcomes some overly convoluted plotting\\, ultimately delivering one of the most satisfying films of the Star Wars saga. Mark Hamill delivers his best screen performance ever\\, by far\\, and the cast as a whole Shines. Rian Johnson delivers warmth\\, humor\\, excitement and pathos in spades.","true":true}
