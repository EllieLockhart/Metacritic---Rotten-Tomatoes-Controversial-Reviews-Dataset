Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Any continuity between the films was crushed by this film. I don't see how they can have an amazing film about \\\"nobodies\\\" in Rogue One and then turn around and have this... thing.... The overriding message in Rogue One was that everyday people doing the right thing could do great things... then you go and make a film where all the normal people in the Resistance get killed and all you have left is the extraordinary Jedi to pick up the slack of an entire movement? It's foolish to the extreme.","true":true}
