Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love star wars. I wanted this to succeed on every level. This movie was a great disappointment. Wrong on so many levels. Great start but became very boring and dull very quickly. Almost felt like a prequel movie in the middle with poor versions of Harry Potter and Battlestar Galactica thrown in. Also\\, feminism has ruined star wars. Numerous plot holes and absurd misplaced humour. When the hype dies down\\, prepare for the huge backlash. So sad.","true":true}
