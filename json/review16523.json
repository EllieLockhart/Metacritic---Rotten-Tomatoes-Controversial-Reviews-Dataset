Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In 2.5 hours they ruined over 40 years of amazing work. The last 2 Disney Movies where excellent! Last Jedi was terrible! Almost every thing about it was bad. Every decision is the movie \\, in regards to the plot and story was taken in the wrong direction. Why would you show Luke sky walker fishing? There is a million other things I wanted to him do. There was soooo many stupid scenes and comedic lines that did not work. I still can\u2019t figure out how they screwed up sooo badly. They need to remake the movie. If there is enough footage hopefully the can try to re-edit it. Princess Leia flying was the beginning of the end for me.","true":true}
