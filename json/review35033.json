Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first and probably only time I will bother to give a review on this site.... and its cause this movie was the worst star wars movie EVER. I cannot believe that critics thought spitting in the eye of star wars fans and making a mockery of everything was GOOD.","true":true}
