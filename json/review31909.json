Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(Spoiler free) Deeply disappointing and a huge let down after The Force Awakens (TFA). The Last Jedi (TLJ) really dropped the ball and wasted all of the momentum\\, goodwill\\, hopefulness\\, and possibilities\\, that were set up in TFA. And the damage this film does to the future of this franchise is likely irreparable. But ... we will see what JJ Abrams can do with episode 9. It's much clearer after the hot mess of TLJ how great of a job Abrams did with TFA. TLJ missess the mark badly in terms of pacing\\, plot\\, character development\\, humor\\, and dialogue. TLJ was a bunch of empty calories. Overall TLJ ranks up there with the prequels in terms of over all badness\/disappointment but for different reasons. ","true":true}
