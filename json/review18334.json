Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this movie was really good to me and introduce new ideas to the Starwars universe that haven't been seen since the original trilogy it wasn't a perfect movie but no movie is my favorite Star Wars movie is still The Empire Strikes Back but this is a close second there were some issues such as with the plot that you'll hear people talk about but the best part about a Star Wars movie in my opinion is being able to use your imagination to fill in the gaps which is what I did but overall when it comes to a Star Wars movie when the parts come that aren't wine glowing if they can keep me entertained during the less interesting parts then you have a great movie which is what we have here and I hope people's opinions change over time and just enjoy the movie","true":true}
