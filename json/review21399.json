Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wish I could tell you that this was\\, indeed\\, the perfect Star Wars film.  That it met and exceeded every expectation that I had allowed myself to build up over the past two years but\\, sadly\\, I can't do that. With some editing and tightening\\, it could have been\\, but like I said earlier\\, that is because someone wanted to give us more than needed.   Overall\\, I had fun and that is really what matters.  I went to be entertained and\\, I was\\, very much so.  There are some genuinely joyful and shocking moments that will make you gasp\\, laugh and even get a little misty eyed.  It is even one of the more humorous entries along the lines of Guardians of the Galaxy at times.   Is the film good?  sure\\, it is\\, but be sure to leave your expectations at the door and go to be entertained. for more go to: https:\/\/latetothegame.blog\/2017\/12\/15\/new-movie-review-star-wars-episode-8-the-last-jedi-for-real-this-time\/","true":true}
