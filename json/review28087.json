Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot was a mess and not interesting. It really wants you to pretend the plot of the original trilogy never happened. Fin goes to some Las Vegas like planet just for kind of something to do? Wait for it to come out on video\\, it's really not worth a trip to the theater.","true":true}
