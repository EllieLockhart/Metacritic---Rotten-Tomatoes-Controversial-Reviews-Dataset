Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the most infuriating and disappointing experience I've ever had watching a movie and that includes the prequels. I left the Phantom Menace underwhelmed and disappointed\\, but not infuriated. Kathleen Kennedy needs to be fired immediately and Rian Johnson shouldn't be let anywhere near a Star Wars film ever again. Disney and Rian Johnson are more concerned with making a political statement than a good movie. They also don't care about the fans or the legacy of classic characters such as Luke Skywalker. They have to tear down Luke Skywalker's legacy because there's no room for a strong male hero in the new Star Wars universe. Disney is more concerned with social justice virtue signaling than respecting 40 years of Star Wars legacy. I would've been happier if they would've made these new movies without including any classic characters. That way I would still have the classics intact and could more easily choose to just ignore these terrible new movies. This movie will still make tons of money\\, but the damage has been done. I won't be paying to see any more of these movies going forward. Disney\\, Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy have ruined Star Wars for me. I felt insulted watching this movie.","true":true}
