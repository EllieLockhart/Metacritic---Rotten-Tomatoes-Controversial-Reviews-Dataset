Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars Episode 8 ..what a disappointment! A few moments of greatest can?t fix the holes in the script or some of the bizarre directions taken.  Luke would have been better off lost because he turned out to b one depressing bastard!  It's a poor rehash of the previous films which may not be surprising but this is done particularly poorly given the opportunity that they had.","true":true}
