Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney brings SJW to Star Wars hardcore. The basic message I got from this was Man Bad\\, Woman Good. Star Wars was about optimism and wonder and childlike awe; now it's about nihilism and erasing the past.\\n\\nNevertheless\\, as execrable as the ethos is\\, it could still be well done. I don't like the message of There Will Be Blood\\, but the movie a masterpiece. This one is not. There are long stretches of boredom\\, unnecessary subplots and characters\\, and nothing resembling an actual well crafted scene until the very end\\, just a series of rapid plot points. Learn the art of the scene from Quentin Tarantino\\, preach less about how evil rich people are and how about bring back some optimism and wonder to Star Wars. That was something Disney used to be good at.","true":true}
