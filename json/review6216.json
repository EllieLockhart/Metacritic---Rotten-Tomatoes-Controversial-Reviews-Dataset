Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney has wiped out the entire legacy of George Lucas\\, this is not Star Wars\\, there is no honor\\, there is no emotional conflict\\, it is confusing and incomplete. The problem was not the fate of the Skywalkers\\, the problem is the fate of the whole series\\, Yoda's words were written by Mickey Mouse and that's it. There are no more rules and traditions within the Star Wars universe\\, or abandon or accept this superficial generation and want quick answers to everything.","true":true}
