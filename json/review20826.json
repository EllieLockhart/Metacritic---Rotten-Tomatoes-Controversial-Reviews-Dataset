Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I want to give it 3 starts but it doesn't deserve it. Lazy plot and cheesy dialogues I still can process but editing in first 30 minutes was so bad that it really bothered me. I will write normal review when I process how disappoiting this film was. It would be a 3.5 or 4 star film if dialogues were good\\, please don't make every movie Marvel. So bad.","true":true}
