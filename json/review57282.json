Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a disgrace to the franchise. It ruins every character in it. They missed a huge opportunity with Luke and gave him a sad sad sad farewell. \\nFinns supposed growing romance is a pathetic attempt as there is no chemsitry at all between the two. \\nYoda was turned into a circus clown.\\nThe casino planet was a boring painful-to-watch segment. \\nThe music was great but cued all wrong so it never added anything to a scene\\, which is sad to say for a Star Wars film. \\nRose \\\"saving\\\" Finn was stupid. He was going to sacrifice himself to save everyone... she nearly kills him and herself by stopping him... so she kept everyone in danger for almost nothing... thats not heroic\\, thats selfish... this movie was a disaster narratively. Anyone that complained Batman v Superman was disjointed cannot possibly say this one is not","true":true}
