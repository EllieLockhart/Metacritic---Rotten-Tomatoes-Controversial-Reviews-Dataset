Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Been a Star Wars fan for years\\, definitely a must seen movie! Lots of suprises and plot twists\\, for those who disliked the movie learn to be patient\\, sad how everyone is disliking only because their theories and questions haven't been debunked. Regardless\\, TLJ provided lots of unexpected outcomes and ended in a great way to pave the next saga. #STARWARS","true":true}
