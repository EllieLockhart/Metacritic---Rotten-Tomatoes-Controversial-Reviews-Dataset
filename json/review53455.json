Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney Strikes Back with another thoughtless addition to the Star Wars universe with The Last Jedi.  The movie felt like a hastily rushed filler episode for a TV show than a feature film.  The new characters we are supposed to be invested in continue to be unbelievable\\, bland\\, and or downright annoying to watch.  Disney continues to character assassinate the ones we've known and loved from the earlier films.  Luke is unrecognizable in this film; his actions and demeanor make no sense and go against everything he stood for in past films.  A great example of this is how he treats his introduction to Rey handing him his lightsaber\\, he promptly does what Disney did to 40 years of Star Wars canon and throws it over his shoulder.   The story is so poorly done I can't believe this is a continuation of the first film or that this could possibly be part of a trilogy\\, I have no clue or expectations on where the story goes from here\\, but most importantly I have no interest in what happens next.  The franchise is truly dead to me.","true":true}
