Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is amazing. The 1\/2 star spamming on RTs is RIDICULOUS. Not liking the film is fair\\, but dont buy into the 1\/2 star trolling. Most of those comments bitch about politics and social issues...like feminism. \\nRidiculous. Now\\, Luke is interesting and IS MORE LUKE THAN EVER once you get past fandom nonsense. Action scenes are top notch and Kylo and Rey are SO DAMN GREAT. I love this film. Go see it and see it at least twice.","true":true}
