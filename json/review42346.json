Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie took one of the best heroes in cinema history and disgraced him for no logical reason.  The story was dumb.  The comedy was dumb.  I love Star Wars.  I hate this movie.  PTSD after watching it.  Half star?  Can I use no star?","true":true}
