Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing. Can\u2019t remember feeling this poorly about spending money to see a movie in a theater. There were two or three character arcs that had a chance from #7; all of them were basically killed off or rendered useless. (Skywalker\\, Snoke and Rey\/Kilo) I remember when the movie Batman and Robin was basically created by the toy industry\\, this had that feel - This is where we want this to go\\, because we own all the content and need to stretch it on for a few decades. Durn and Del toro\\, basically serious acting chops\\, leading useless characters. In hindsight after a few months\\, its almost like since Johnson and Abrams\\, come form the same director collective; that this is an ego driven who can make a bigger mess project. As for the\\, well old people don\u2019t get it; I have two twin three years olds that won\u2019t know Star Wars - I wouldn\u2019t want them to waste their time on this franchise 3 maybe 4 movies out of 7 (soon 8) isn\u2019t worth it","true":true}
