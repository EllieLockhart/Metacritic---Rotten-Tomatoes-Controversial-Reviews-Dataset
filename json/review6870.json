Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dreadful\\, awful\\, boring\\, overlong\\, poor characters\\, overly loud sound effects (no doubt to wake people slumbering through it). I just don't understand how anyone liked this tripe - unless they were paid to say so (which I strongly suspect to be the case). \\n\\nI so wish this was the last Jedi and hence the last Star Wars.","true":true}
