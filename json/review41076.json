Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had a lot of potential however the writers did a horrendous job with the story. I can't believe the critics are rating it so well! That tells me they haven't watched the movie yet. So many things wrong with it I don't know where to begin. Long story short\\, don't waste your time. There are better movies out there like Thor or Coco.","true":true}
