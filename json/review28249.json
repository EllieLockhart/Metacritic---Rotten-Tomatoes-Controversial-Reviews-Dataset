Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poor story line and bad editing\\, multiple scenes that have no use towards the plot which makes the movie non linear and stuttering with pace . it had potential but it seems like there were diffrent ideas on how the movie should be portrayed. for a movie as hyped as this with high critic reviews I am immensely disappointed\\, by far the worst star wars ever made","true":true}
