Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Is it perfect? No. But much of the criticism being lobbed at this movie is by people who are only upset that they couldn't predict the entire movie. This movie will be much more beloved once the dust settles.","true":true}
