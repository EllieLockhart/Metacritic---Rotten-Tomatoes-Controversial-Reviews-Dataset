Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was such a disappointing film. I had high hopes for Luke to show how powerful he had become with the force but what they did to his character was almost criminal. A lot of the film did not make sense\\, too many plot holes to list and the casino planet.....why put that in at all?????  Just a terrible film and wasted opportunity.","true":true}
