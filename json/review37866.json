Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The riskier film of the Star Wars saga. Brave and bold. With some scenes that many hard-core fans will deem as \\\"stupid\\\" or \\\"nonsensical\\\". To me\\, however\\, it's been one of the funniest times in a theatre for me in a long time.","true":true}
