Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There's a decent chunk of the film that could've been used for Episode IX.  However\\, it's a sort of blessing in disguise.  By using those elements now\\, it sets an unpredictable stage for the next film.  The film does honor it's past\\, but the plot twists and character development make something that has been around for 40 years something new and different.","true":true}
