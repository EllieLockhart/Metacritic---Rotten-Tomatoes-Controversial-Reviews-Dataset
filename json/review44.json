{"90450":"The Yakuza series deliverers yet again with a awesome addition. This time it's set in the 80s. The plot follows both Kiryu & Majima and is executed really well. While the first two chapters are a bit slow the rest of the game is so much fun. The Main story is really dark and grim but is balanced really well with the side content. I really love the crazy side of the game with all the weird subplots and mini games. They make the game a unique experience. Definitely recommended for both newcomers and fans.\u2026 Expand","Y0":"true","2019-05-09":null,"10":null,"Dude\\, i god damn love this game and this franchise\\, its soooo good\\, 0 is a prequel to the series and is an EXCELLENT starting point for newcomers\\, its amazingly good\\, great\\, testosterone filled boss fights\\, PHENOMENAL music\\, a crapload of side content that is ACTUALLY fun (weird right?) and worth doing\\, the entire game was made to be fun (contrary to the \\\"AAA\\\" games that infest the gamingDude\\, i god damn love this game and this franchise\\, its soooo good\\, 0 is a prequel to the series and is an EXCELLENT starting point for newcomers\\, its amazingly good\\, great\\, testosterone filled boss fights\\, PHENOMENAL music\\, a crapload of side content that is ACTUALLY fun (weird right?) and worth doing\\, the entire game was made to be fun (contrary to the \\\"AAA\\\" games that infest the gaming market nowadays)\\, i couldnt possibly recommend this game more\\, i can safely say\\, after 23 years of living on Earth\\, Yakuza 0 is my MOST favourite game ever\\, the Yakuza series as a whole is my MOST favourite gaming series ever\\, AND the development studio behind the Yakuza games\\, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio is DEFINITELY my favourite gaming studio ever\\, needless to say\\, this game gets 100 out of 10.\u2026 Expand":null,"true":null}
