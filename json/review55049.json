Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've heard all I want to hear about this. That awful opening\\, Leia flying like Superman\\, Luke being completely out of character\\, Holdo not telling anyone her plan\\, Rose's utter delusion when \\\"saving\\\" Finn... I wasn't even particularly attached to Star Wars\\, and even I'm kind of offended by what Rian Johnson did here. When I saw The Force Awakens\\, while I was painfully aware of how similar it was to A New Hope\\, I also wanted to see how the story progressed. But it didn't progress. The Last Jedi took everything backwards. They should have just let J.J. Abrams do the whole trilogy.","true":true}
