We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"FIRST PARAGRAPH HAS SPOILERS This game is the game of the year for sure\\, it has a great story even making the player sympathize with Joel\u2019s killer and if you don\u2019t\\, you surely sympathize with Lev and consequently you don\u2019t want Abby to die. You end this game completely destroyed because you don\u2019t know if you want Ellie to win or Abby to win and you feel what the characters are dealing with for example when you see Abby getting to the surgery room and seeing her dad dead\\, you feel bad for her\\, when Ellie is in Santa Barbara\\, you see that she is broken\\, you see that she doesn\u2019t care about anything anymore and she even has things written on her book saying that she regrets going to Santa Barbara and wanted to turn back.The gameplay is better then the previous one\\, because the new features that were added (crouching and dodging) work perfectly and makes the gameplay look real and with very human   movements\\, when you play it you actually say \u201cthat\u2019s what I would do\u201d Gameplay 10\/10 The graphics\\, facial expressions and the ambience   are the best ever made10\/10 The story is great and it has a meaning\\, which is something the first one didn\u2019t have\\, because although it is also a great story\\, it\u2019s a very well made genetical adventure story\\, TLOU2 in may opinion has a story that is slightly better then the previous one because of that\\, this sequel is a lot darker then the first one and I think that was a great change since it reflects what goes on in both protagonist\u2019s minds\\, but the only problem of the story was that. It was a really well written story and it\u2019s only not a 10\/10 because of what I\u2019m going to say on the next paragraph Story 9\/10 Actually I would give this game a 9.7 because there are some minimal details that were unnecessary such as Mel being pregnant\\, I thought that was only to shock the player since her not being pregnant wouldn\u2019t change nothing in the story and also the fact that they had to make Joel kinda stupid toKill him\u2026 Expand","true":true}
