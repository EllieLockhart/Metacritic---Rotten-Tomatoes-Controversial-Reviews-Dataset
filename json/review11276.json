Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly the worst movie yet. It makes 1-3 look decent with at least their own plot line that keeps you interested. You amost literally get to watch two main scenes for the almost 3 hours of your life you lost. First one is a space ship running out of fuel\\, being chased by an Empire fleet which\\, despite their top technology\\, can't catch up. The next is Ray and Luke walking up and down a mountain arguing about who and what cause the Jedi to decline which all becomes mute after about 2 hours cause it all ends anyway\\, with Luke feeling sorry for himself. Worst of all\\, questions which were sparked in the initial sub par re-boot go almost totally under the radar despite significant plot characters dying. Toss in a dose of stupid Disney humour and you got yourself the last Jedi. 3h of accomplishing nothing until the last 10 minutes when what we already know\\, she becomes a Jedi. Save your time and money.","true":true}
