Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible entry in the franchise. It is not that hard to make a good Star Wars film\\, yet somehow the creative team behind this movie seemed to have trouble. Luke didn't feel like Luke at ALL\\, we still don't know who Snoke is and now he is dead\\, Rey received zero training of any kind yet is still excellent with a lightsaber and the most powerful jedi (clearly done because Rey is a female)\\, Kylo Ren is a weak baby\\, Leia flying in space..??\\, and an anticlimactic death for Luke Skywalker who really should have been showcased as the most powerful Jedi because he EARNED that position - Rey didn't. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND SKIP THIS FILM! Financially supporting this movie will only encourage Disney to continue creating garbage quality Star Wars films.","true":true}
