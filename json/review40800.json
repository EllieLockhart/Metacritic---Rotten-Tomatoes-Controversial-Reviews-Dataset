Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie as a stand alone film is really not bad. The cinematographers and graphic artists deserve a lot of praise. \\nThe 2 star rating comes from the MASSIVE plot holes in the film. The most intense scene in the movie not only destroys a bunch of ships\\, but the past and future star wars battles. It hurts my head to think of how many problems the single scene causes the universe\\, and it's not even the only scene wrong with the movie.","true":true}
