Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I came into this movie with an open mind & with no high expectation. From what The Force Awakens gave me\\, I was excited to see some missing links to be connected\\, & background stories explain coming into The Last Jedi. Boy was I so let down by this movie. There are so many missing pieces to where I still have questions & they didn't even give me a small peak to carry over to episode 9. It feels like Episode 9 could be a hot mess & JJ Abbrams will have a lot of cleaning up to do from episode 8. It will be a miracle if JJ can save episode 9.","true":true}
