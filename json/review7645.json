Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everything that was set up with Force Awakens was ignored here and destroyed which made no sense. This trilogy still has no solid story\\, huge plots\\, wasted talent on characters that are poorly written.\\nNew characters have no charisma and characters we love and are interest in are killed off in really stupid ways.  \\nFeminism is a popular topic nowadays but when you destroy characters like Admiral Ackbar just to have a female character in\\, is beyond stupid. This is Sci-Fi and things like feminism shouldn't be implemented in. N one cares\\, Good story is what makes the movie great. In this case there was no good story.","true":true}
