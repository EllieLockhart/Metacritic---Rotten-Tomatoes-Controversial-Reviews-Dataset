Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How did a once progressive\\, futuristic hope inspiring epic franchise come crumbling down like this ? It's dignity and excitement having done a disappearing act like Luke does at the end of this film. While Luke manages to leave the franchise with his dignity still intact\\, no one else associated with this film should. The script was as flimsy as a 1970s porno. With very poor attempts to borrow and improvise on points from the original trilogy. My biggest regret from this movie ? Actually paying to watch it at the cinemas. The Star Wars universe is nothing more than a cash cow from which Disney milks. Apt that they including a milking scene in this film.","true":true}
