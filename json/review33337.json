Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Surprisingly bad instalment.\\n\\nIgnores pretty much everything that happened in the last film\\, no progression there. Its own plot doesnt lead anywhere either\\, luke was pointless\\, rey and kylo go nowhere (still good girl v bad guy)\\, too many plot holes to list\\, extremely weak sub-plots that\\, again\\, go nowhere\\, too long\\, messy all round. Its like they cant find anything worthwhile for characters to do. Phasma? Why even giver her a name\\, zero character. Rose? Who cares? Finn? No reason or believable motivation. Leia? What did she do again? So on and so forth.\\n\\nThere is pretty much no point in this and TFA existing\\, as episode 9 has no buildup whatsoever now. With so much potential........what a waste. Amazingly ill-planned \\\"trilogy\\\". Zero interest in whatever inconsistent\/poor story they comes next.","true":true}
