Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To start off\\, I'm not a Star Wars fanatic by any stretch\\, but I can appreciate the movies I'll also state that Rogue One is probably my favorite SW Universe film. Summary: Great visuals\\, weak and lazy story full of cheap events to further the plot to the next mechanically scripted scene. The saving grace of this movie was the spectacular visual effects\\, BB-8\\, the music similar to the cantina theme from the original trilogy\\, the ice foxes and the cute little bird creatures. I'm obviously trying not to spoil anything for those wishing to experience this watered down continuation of the series. I can understand where this movie comes from due to its mediocre predecessor\\, Episode VII. And really\\, JJ? Red ground? Like red matter in Alias and Star Trek (2009)? Worth seeing once; not a later purchase.","true":true}
