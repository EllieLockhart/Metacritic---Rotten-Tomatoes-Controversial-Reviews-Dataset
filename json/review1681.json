Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As an avid long-time Star Wars fan\\, I was incredibly disappointed with The Last Jedi.  So many under developed characters and plot lines with great potential that were ended too soon. Clearly written by a movie writer rather than a series\/franchise maker. Tone and timing issues with the humor. Was not Episode V level witty humor\\, but rather silly humor meant for kids that cheapened the overall vibe.  This was the first episode that to me felt like a Star Wars-themed Disney movie rather than a true Star Wars installment. And enough of the veganism and anti-war message sideshow - there's a place for that and it's not a Star Wars storyline. The Lucas-Star Wars is now truly gone. Worst Star Wars movie ever made!!","true":true}
