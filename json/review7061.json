Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Eh. Wasn\u2019t bad\\, but wasn\u2019t great. The whole subplot was unnecessary\\, and the final climax was a bit of a hoax. Sets things up nicely for the future and beautifully made\\, but not great.
