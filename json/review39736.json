Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a great movie if you want a great fantasy movie in space\\, but It's very poor if you're seeking a Star Wars sequel.\\nAwesome visual and audio effects but all the Star Wars lore is thrown to trash. It tried to have as many plot twists as possible\\, but\\, almost all of them were very poorly made\\, reaching the level of stupidity in certain moments.\\nSomething that made no sense at all was the fact that this movie has a lot of funny moments\\, even though some of them were very boring and sometimes totally anti-climax\\, something that I wouldn't expect from any Star Wars movie.\\nI reaffirm: It's a great movie if you don't understand the Star Wars lore.","true":true}
