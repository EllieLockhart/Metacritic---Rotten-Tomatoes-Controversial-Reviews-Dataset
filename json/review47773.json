Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When this movie first came out\\, I was one of the many \\\"bots\\\" that claimed that it wasn't bad\\, and the if someone didn't like it\\, that person was a loser nerd. But after months of listening to the critiques\\, and watching Solo\\, I definitely see why the Last Jedi gets so much heat\\, and I too dislike it. I still do not think it's the worst Star Wars movie ever made (that would be the christmas special)\\, but it's still bad.","true":true}
