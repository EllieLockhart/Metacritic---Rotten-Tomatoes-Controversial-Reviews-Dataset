Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just watch the trailer over and over....all of the best parts of this movie are in it.  Then you wouldn't have to sit through the other 150 minutes of pure garbage.  You'd spare yourself the agony of paying to be lectured to on social and political issues.  You'd also probably wouldn't fall asleep due to being absolutely bored out of your mind.","true":true}
