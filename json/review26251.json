Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not terrible\\, has some good moments\\, but it does a disservice to the old fans and  the original trilogy.  Disney is pushing this new story line and is focused on a new character line instead of integrating the old and the new and then transitioning slowly to the new characters.  To quote the movie\\, \\\"kill the past\\\"\\, that is what they are doing to Star Wars and half the fans.","true":true}
