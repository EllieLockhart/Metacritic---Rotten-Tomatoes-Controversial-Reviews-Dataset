Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Many people absolutely hated the game and many loved it.

No\\, it\u2019s certainly not either. First of all\\, I would like to address one issue. Many people calling it woke.

No\\, it\u2019s certainly not either. First of all\\, I would like to address one issue. Many people calling it woke. Ellie was shown as a homosexual even in the first game\\, so idk why these people are complaining now. People happen to be gay or straight\\, and Ellie just happens to be gay\\, what\u2019s wrong with that? Second of all\\, just like in real life\\, stories happen to people regardless of your sexual orientation. So what if Ellie is gay\\, as we can see from the plot of game\\, her sexual orientation wasn\u2019t even the focus point of the game\\, her struggle with her emotion and inner conflict is. A lot of people felt like certain characters\u2019 deaths were a little rushed. Well\\, that\u2019s what death is like in real life\\, I\u2019ve lost family members in my life and their deaths were just like Joel\\, Jesse or Owen\u2019s. It comes when you are not expecting it\\, it comes suddenly and you will never be prepared for it. So in that sense\\, these people\u2019s deaths are real\\, it\u2019s hard to take\\, it\u2019s emotional\\, and you never expected it. It only takes one things to kill someone and people tend to underestimate how vulnerable they actually are.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
