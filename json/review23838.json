Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Made an account specifically to review this movie...star wars is dead\\, 2 ways to save it\\, character wakes up sees this is all a bad dream and never happened... just like the fans are thinking...2nd they just make movies living in ther after life in the force\\, considering every one is dead EVERYONE! No reason to watch anymore villian is not powerful... don't even get me started on way they did to luke....mark tried warning us\\,  you deserved better mark hamill\\, 40 years of a waste of a character REALLY? THANKS DISNEY! kennedy and rian must go","true":true}
