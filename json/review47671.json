Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When Disney bought the rights to Starwars\\, there was worry about the future of Starwars\\, but then The Force Awakens and Rogue One came out and we all thrilled. However this movie is everything we feared what Disney could do\\, they've destroyed Luke's legacy by destroying his character. We'll get over all the plot holes\\, even the ridiculous slow motion space chase which made no sense\\, we'll get over that\\, but the portrail of Luke has made him out to be a broken coward. Its supposed to be a sequel to the previous 7 movies\\, it would be no different to Leia joining the First Order\\, it would totally destroy her character and everything she did in the previous movies.   The only good thing about this movie are the special effects\\, they're quiet good.  \\nWhat they should have done is removed all the starwars references\\, and made it a generic sci-fi\\, then it would have been very good.","true":true}
