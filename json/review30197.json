Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw it last night and thought it was horrendously\\, laughably bad. Worse than The Phantom Menace\\, which I thought was impossible. 40% of the movie is pointless filler\\, and boring characters dominate the movie while other\\, more interesting ones\\, have a lot of screen-time. I'm not sure I'd sit through it again if someone paid me. For reference\\, I disliked The Force Awakens and loved Rogue One.","true":true}
