Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Even Mark Hamil didn't like it.\\nJohnson indeed subverted my expectations.\\ni was expecting a good sequel to TFA which despite its flaws i enjoy\\, and what i got was a total loss of interest for whatever is next.\\ni don't care for episode XI\\, i wont pay a cent for episode XI\\, and you shouldn't either.\\nBravo Ryan.","true":true}
