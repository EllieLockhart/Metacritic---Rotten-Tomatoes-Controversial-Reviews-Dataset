Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My dog could write a more fitting sequel to the franchise than this hot mess. Every time you think they are just about to pull off a truly interesting twist\\, a plot that might actually go somewhere and be fresh and relevant and in line with the entire universe that's been established\\, they slap you in the face and lecture you for your old-fashion ways. Silly me. I thought characters were at least supposed to act and behave logically\\, to some extent.","true":true}
