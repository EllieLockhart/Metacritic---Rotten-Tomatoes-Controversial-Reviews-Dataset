Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible\\, terrible\\, terrible movie. I have loved literally every single Star Wars movie ever including even Rogue One and Episode VII.\\n\\nThis film was just trash.
