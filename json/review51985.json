Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After a couple of views\\, it still feels kind weird as a Star Wars movie. If Episode IX makes sense of the crap that happened in this one\\, I might just come back and re-assess the film. For now\\, keep this generous one WHOLE star.","true":true}
