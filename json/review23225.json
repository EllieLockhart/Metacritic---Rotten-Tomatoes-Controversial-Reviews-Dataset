Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it. I have been a fan of the Star Wars franchise from the beginning and this was a worthy addition to the legacy. Don't get caught up in the anti-hype. You will most likely love this one just like you did the others. (except possibly episode I) ??","true":true}
