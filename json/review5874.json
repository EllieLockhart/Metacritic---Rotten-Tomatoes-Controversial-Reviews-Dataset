Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing.  Character development is OUT in action blockbusters\\, and critics don't seem to mind.  Like The Force Awakens\\, the movie is bizarrely paced (I'm fairly certain less than 3 days have passed from the beginning of The Force Awakens to the end of The Last Jedi) and is filled with the kind of inexplicable\\, pointless diversions that made Episodes 1-3 so unwatchable (see Casino Planet).  You do care more about Rey and Ren than in the Force Awakens\\, but beyond that virtually every character --including Luke and Leia -- feels shallow and expendable.  Still unclear what the First Order is\\, where it came from\\, and what they're fighting for.","true":true}
