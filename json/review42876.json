Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was really bad. It wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen but I had trouble staying awake. I feel so tricked by the critics. Their reviews are not accurate. You can still go see but do not say I didn't warn you. #lastjedisucks","true":true}
