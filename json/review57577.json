Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thoroughly disappointed that there has been more thought on how to turn star wars into a feminist diatribe than to come up with a better storyline. I have 3 daughters and two boys. My daughters will play the role of Rey in their games for maybe a day and then move on. My boys however decided last night that the only suitable role for them was Kylo Wren. Nice work star wars\\, for the first time in history you've encouraged boys to want to be the bad guys. The two positive male role models in the film were made to look pathetic. I'm not opposed to mixing it up and having some female Jedi and leadership\\, but you went way too far. You need a strong male Jedi to get our attention back. I'm done with supporting star wars in Theaters\\, they went too far. Hope the feminists are happy.","true":true}
