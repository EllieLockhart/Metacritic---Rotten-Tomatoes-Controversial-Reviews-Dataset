Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst star wars movie to date\\, and it comes from someone who watched the disgrace called the phantom menace\\, which\\, even with all the bullshit it had\\, still managed to move the plot and the lore forward. Here there is absolute nothing. Odd decisions\\, cheap deaths that look more like actors contract terminations that plot planing\\, huge amounts of plot holes\\, unnecessary and stretched segments. Just a horrible movie overall that if not for being named star wars would be destroyed by the critic.","true":true}
