Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst star wars movie yet. Terrible plot\\, terrible writing\\, continuity issues and nonsensical plot devices with no actual humor to the jokes. The politics in this movie made me cringe as well.","true":true}
