Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The more I think about the movie the more I dislike it.  Many plot holes.  Characters were changed to the point where it doesn't make sense.  Fight scenes were anti-climactic or bland.  Some parts were just ridiculous.  Many scenes and even character contributed absolutely nothing to the story and just ended up being filler at best but most realistically a waste of time.","true":true}
