Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The most I can give this game is a 4\/10. The gameplay and graphics are phenomenal\\, possibly one of the best of all time (in my opinion)\\, but the story in this game is very lacking and is what makes this game so unfavorable. A story game such as Telltales: The Walking Dead without a good story is like playing an FPS game without the actual \\\"shooter\\\" aspect. In my opinion\\, it would have been better if there just wasn't a part 2 at all. The main reason people love The Last Of Us so much is because of the relationship between Joel and Ellie. When everyone saw the trailers to The Last Of Us 2 we expected to be going on another journey with Joel and Ellie. Instead the game was ruined by killing Joel in the worst way possible by some new character named Abby and expected us to feel sympathy for her. Not to mention the game wants us to play as Abby for more than half of the game.\rThere are other problems with the game such as false marketing lies such as replacing Joel's character model in-game with Jesse's character model to trick us to think we would be playing with Joel in-game. There is also a problem such as the altering of Joel's character. Joel has 20 years of survival experience and that's what kept him alive. Then suddenly he just walks into a locked room with 10+ armed people he doesn't know and gets beat to death. Conclusion\\, the game to me was a disappointment and waiting 7 years for this was not worth it.\r\r(now hopefully I'm not going to get dislike botted by people working for naughty dog or game journos.)\u2026 Expand","true":true}
