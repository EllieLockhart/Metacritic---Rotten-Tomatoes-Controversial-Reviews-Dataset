Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Between the weird situation where bombs fall down in zero gravity to the crazy use of the force by Leia\\, this is so poor of a movie that I won't consider watching it again.  It is one long Jar Jar Binx ride as far as I'm concerned.","true":true}
