Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From a storytelling perspective\\, this movie was too long\\, as so many of our generation seem to be. But the creators managed to craft a universe I was happy to sit in for 3 hours. It was like marathoning 3 episodes of an amazing TV show back to back on a giant screen. It's possible the absolutely stunning visuals are covering up some storytelling holes that I won't notice and be annoyed by until my second or third viewing\\, but even so I don't hesitate with my rating. \\n\\nThis movie had me wringing my hands and crying and cheering from the opening scene to the end. And unlike so many Star Wars films\\, it managed to utilize archetypal framing techniques while *also* subverting tired storytelling tropes. They say a good twist must be both surprising and inevitable. Go into this film expecting nothing\\, and it will be perfect. Go in expecting it to validate your pet theory and you will probably be angry at it. Because this is nothing I expected. It is so very much more.","true":true}
