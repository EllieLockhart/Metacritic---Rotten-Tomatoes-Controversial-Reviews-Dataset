Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Apparently\\, according to the media\\, anyone who doesn't like this film is just \\\"trolling.\\\"\\n\\nSo I guess I'm just \\\"trolling\\\" when I say I've loved every single Star Wars movie ever made including even the Clone Wars Carton one that I saw in the theater but not only hated this new one\\, but hated it so much that I will likely never see another Star Wars film ever again.\\n\\nNo lightsaber fight. Entire plots thrown out and discarded. Annoying new characters like Rose who are worse than Jar Jar.\\n\\nRidiculous plot! And now there is no one left who can pose as a proper main villain. I love Kylo Ren as a character but he's like the Star Wars version of Vegeta.\\n\\nThere is no proper truly evil character left. The entire movie is just crap.","true":true}
