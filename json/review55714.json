Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the worst movies i have ever scene there is so much wrong with this movie  you couldn't fit it on this entire page if you wanted to this movie was a joke and hope fully director Rian Johnson learns from his terrible mistakes. This movie split the fan base in half\\, from people who actually care about star wars and the little kids and people who think the newer trilogy is cool. This movie was awful and should not be considered canon.","true":true}
