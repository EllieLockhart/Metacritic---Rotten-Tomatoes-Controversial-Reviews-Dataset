Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you're a person who know alot about star wars and the backstory of it's characters it will make you questions thing like\\, since when is lea a force user or who does try know so much how to use the force or how to fight.\\nNow if you're a usual star wars fan ( just watch the cannon films) the dip is going to be ok.","true":true}
