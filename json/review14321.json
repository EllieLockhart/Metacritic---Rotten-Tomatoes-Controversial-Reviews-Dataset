Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I grew up with Star Wars\\, and I know the ways of a Jedi better than Rian Johnson. Luke's demise was completely out of the character development of his past solid storyline and in his Jedi training. It was poor writing to get rid of Mark Hamill likely at Disney's request or KK. The movie was too long. The Canto Brite scene was unnecessary and impractical considering the Rebel fleet only had 6 hours of fuel remaining. Shoddy writing. Star Wars had a good run but it stinks now. It made this much money only because fans had to pay to go see it before they could hate it. You see\\, fans had HOPE\\, which is what a Jedi always has.....and Luke would have had. Rian Johnson didn't understand that. There's a reason this movie made less than TFA.  I'm sure the 3rd installment will make even less money. The Force is no longer strong in Star Wars. Corporate greed\\, power\\, and political agendas are though. Don't see it.","true":true}
