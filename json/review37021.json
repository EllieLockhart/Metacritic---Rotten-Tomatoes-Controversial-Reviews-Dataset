Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was visually appealing and it had few interesting action sequences but the overall story was a mess. In my opinion this movie is riddled with plot holes that just took me out of the experience and ruined my enjoyment\\, I get Rian Johnson wanted to surprise us with plot twist after plot twist and  alot of the humor did not work at all. The movie overall felt superficial in my eyes and did not make sense the more I think about it and discuss it with my friends. It just felt like a slap in the face to star wars fans.","true":true}
