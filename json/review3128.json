Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bad written characters and story. Also dismissing everything that Abrams set up in Force Awakens was destroyed in this movie made me not liking the movie. It was watchable action flick\\, but for a Star Wars movie it was big disappointment.","true":true}
