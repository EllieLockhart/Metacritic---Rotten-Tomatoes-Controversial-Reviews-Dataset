Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Every single male in this movie acts like someone you should not be around. The only chance of having some heroism\\, by a character that is like the Jar Jar of this trilogy\\, would be to have Finn sacrifice himself for everyone else. At the last moment he is stopped by the worst character of every SW movie yet\\, and then she utters a sentence that is just... soooo snowflaky that it just becomes unbearable! \\n\\nSeveral things break this universe's rules and many things are downright stupid. The only good thing about it is the visuals. The story sucks and it killed my motivation to watch episode XIX.","true":true}
