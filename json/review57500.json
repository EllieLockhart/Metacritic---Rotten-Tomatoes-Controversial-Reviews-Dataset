Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This Star Wars film certainly was an anomaly compared to other Star Wars films\\, and certainly wasn't the best film in the franchise but nevertheless this film thoroughly piqued my interest. It included a few of the interplanetary battles that are so renowned in Star Wars films\\, displayed a more in-depth look at the inner workings of the First Order\\, and showed us the extent of Rey's jedi capabilities. One thing it did lack was the heavily anticipated lightsaber duel\\, while they did have one but it was nothing short of a bore. This film dived more into the emotional aspect of our beloved heroes rather than the raging universe of combat that is usually showed in these films; and while the emotional aspect was nice to see\\, I think I can speak for many when I say that this can remain a one time thing.","true":true}
