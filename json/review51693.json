Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A disappointing instalment. \\n\\nPros: looked great\\, action sequence where exciting (especially the opening and closing scenes)\\, some humour hit the mark. \\n\\nCons: Terrible writing and dialog - to much character exposition\\, explaining things that don't need explaing and spoon feeding audience.   Bad use of humour in many key moments killing dramatic tension.  No where near as edgy as ESB and with central characters that you just don't care that much about! Plot wholes galore! Breaking with established cinematic universe conventions therby shattering the escapeism and fantasy the world provides its fans. No development of Snoke. Far too Disney family friendly with wholesome messages.","true":true}
