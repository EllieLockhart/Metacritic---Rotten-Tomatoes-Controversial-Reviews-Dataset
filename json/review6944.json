Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily my least favorite of all of the Prequel\/Sequels so far. I'd rather listen to Jar Jar Binks than try to struggle with the absurdity of the plot devices used in this film. There's no ill will on the director\\, cast\\, or crew\\, the fault lies in whoever green-lighted a story with so many frustratingly pointless story line obstacles.","true":true}
