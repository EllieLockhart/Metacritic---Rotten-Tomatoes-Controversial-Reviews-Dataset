Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I came out of this movie feeling like the essence of what made these great was stripped away. The movie obliterated the suspense and intrigue TFA created. It was like it borrowed a visual aesthetic from a beloved franchise and applied it to some random plot orchestrated by an over ambitious director trying to be outrageous. I feel sad\\, the magic that made these movies great has been snuffed out. I feel sad that beloved characters were trivialised and used as token. I fell sad that new characters were underdeveloped and killed off with out engaging emotionally with the story or audience. We felt more for that porg Chewbacca was about to eat than Holdo\\, Phasma and Snoke. Overall I appreciate the intent to do something new and revitalise the franchise but this failed in my opinion. I feel stripped of the wonder and excitement I have felt as a child seeing the original trilogy. The prequels had their issues but it felt like the same galaxy\\, expanded and explored the history of what had come before\/after. I want to like the movie but the story was disjointed\\, rushed and more concerned with getting a laugh than feeding us with active story development and answers that were so important to fans for years. Please try mend this mess in Episode IX.","true":true}
