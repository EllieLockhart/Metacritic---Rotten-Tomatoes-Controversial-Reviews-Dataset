Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I give this movie enough of a score so it can count and not be removed. It has components of a star wars movie but its not a star wards movie since its trying to be a superhero movie. The movie fails on character development established in its predecessor and is an blatant contradiction to its predecessor as well. Characters I was falling in love with like Fin\\, Poe and Captain Phasma have little to no character arc and are dramatically under used and replaced for Vice Admiral Holdo or Rose two characters that contradict the strong female characters established in the Star Wars universe.","true":true}
