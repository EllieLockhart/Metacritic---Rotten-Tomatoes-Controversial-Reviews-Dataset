Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Incredible\\, is the only word that describes this movie. It subverted my expectations in the best ways possible. I'm so glad it didn't play out like I assumed it would. It is such a beautiful movie. With many iconic shots.  Mark Hamill has never been better in a movie. He really stepped up to the challenge of bringing back Luke and knocked out of the park. While controversial I think the filmmakers decision to include more shades of gray into the actions of the characters was a great choice. \\n\\nThe way other fans are mad about how different this movie is than what they envisioned in their minds. I find very interesting and I feel if  the original Star Wars had come out today and then was followed up with the Empire Strikes back they would feel the same way about that film. I think in hindsight\\, this movie will be cherished as the jumpstart the Star Wars franchised desperately needed to stay relevant. Is it perfect? No of course not\\, it's sluggish in the middle and while I like the theme about failure the director was going for with how some of the storylines played out\\, that part wasnt as engaging as the rest of the movie. At least out of that part we get Rose\\, who is a wonderful new charater and I love how she affects Finn. Thank you Rian Johnson for this audacious and divisive movie.","true":true}
