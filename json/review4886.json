Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"***Contains Some Very Minor Spoilers***\\nOn whole The Last Jedi was excellent. Probably the most beautifully shot Star Wars film to date. I loved the character development throughout the film and the treatment of Luke's failure as a Jedi Master allows for an actual interesting movie and sets the stage for the singular most clever and impressive display of the force in all of Star Wars. Mark Hamill\\, Daisy Ridley\\, and Adam Driver steal the show with fantastic performances.\\n\\nOn the nitpicky side... I thought the humor was a bit too slapsticky\\, though it didn't bug me much. I thought Canto Bight could have been handled a bit better - particularly I could have done without the chase scene at the end of it - maybe something with blasters or using the Fathiers as a distraction rather than the means of escape.\\n\\nOverall a super entertaining movie with some absolutely jaw dropping moments.","true":true}
