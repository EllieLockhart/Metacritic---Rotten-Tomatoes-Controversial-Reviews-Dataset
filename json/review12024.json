Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely loved this movie! I know a lot of people didn\u2019t like it but in my opinion they didn\u2019t like it because it wasn\u2019t played safe. They tried new things\\, went in new directions\\, showed off angles of characters that are totally valid but different then what people thought and for those reasons many didn\u2019t like it. I loved being kept on my toes. If everything were to happen that I expected\\, it wouldn\u2019t have been enjoyable and as such I was extremely pleased and can\u2019t wait to see it again!","true":true}
