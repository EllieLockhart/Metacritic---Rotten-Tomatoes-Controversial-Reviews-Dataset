Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An abomination of a Star Wars movie. I'm one of \\\"those\\\" people that first saw Star Wars when I was 7 years old when a New Hope came out. I don't know who the grizzled guy living on the rock was but it wasn't Luke Skywalker. Rian Johnson should be banned from making anything more related to Star Wars. Unfortunately it won't matter. I will never pay money to see a new Star Wars movie again. Lifetime fan and I've been back handed by Disney. Maybe they can put Dick Van Dyke in episode 9 so him and Leia Poppins can do a dance number together. If forced to choose I would watch Phantom Menace a thousand times before I would watch the Last Jedi again. I feel sorry for the main actors. They all deserved better than this script and movie. Good bye Star Wars.","true":true}
