Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ does not answer any questions that matter. 1) knights of ren? 2) who the eff is Snoke? how did he become so powerful\/ rich? 3) what was the point of the \\\"las vegas\\\" planet? 4) why didn't Leia die? 5)are Rey's parents really nobodies? 6) the meaning behind the lightsaber calling to Rey in TFA\\, and then in TLJ it just breaks with no significance??? 7) where is this \\\"true power of the dark side\\\"? we have yet to see the force be so powerful\\, yet we are always hearing about how powerful it really is.... such a let down. \\n\\nand some speculation. Luke and Leia should have left the world together\\, it just would have made more sense. \\n\\nreally a huge dissapointment to all fanboys out there who know the stories\\, read the comics\\, and all the inbetween info. this is just another Disneyfied let down\\, in it for the money\\, not sticking to the true story... TLJ was a jumbled mess and makes \\\"The phantom menace\\\" look like \\\"The empire strikes back\\\" \\n\\nwe need something really dark\\, something that will make the audience gasp\\, and really root Rey to fulfill her destiny\\, not set it up for a possible speculation about a romance. \\n\\nreally really diapointed","true":true}
