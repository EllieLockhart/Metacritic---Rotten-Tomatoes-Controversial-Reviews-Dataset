Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is terrible.\\nThe bad rating is not due to bots or racists\\, it's because we were given a movie that does not deserve the title Star Wars. I don't care about fan theories and I rated the movie pootly because I got: Very bad overall story\\, huge plot holes and lack of character motovations. \\nThe movie was so focused on doing unexpected stuff that there was no time for actually telling a meaningful plot despite 150 minutes runtime.\\n\\nDon't waste 3 hours of your life watching this!","true":true}
