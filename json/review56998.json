Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They killed the trilogy for me. Luke is a disaster\\, a bunch of plot holes\\, a tons of scene was nonsense\\, lame jokes...etc. I wish I never saw that movie. I hope I can watch Luke in the original trilogy with the same eyes as I watched him before this movie. Damn. I'm angry and dissapointed. The CGI was top notch btw.","true":true}
