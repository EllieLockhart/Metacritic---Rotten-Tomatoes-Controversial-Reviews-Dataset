Naughty dog was able to exceed all my expectations. This game is one of the best games i've ever seen. The technical part of the game is very well done\\, I don\u2019t know what to complain about.

BUT in this game there is such an ambiguous thing as the plot (spoilers). The game begins with the murder of Joel. And after that we have a large plot about revenge and hate. We can play as lovely Ellie and as Abby (she is the murder). So we can see situation from two hands. To be honest I hated this game from the beginning to the end. But after i saw the end\\, I understand what creators wanted to say. I recommend all people to play this game\u2026 Expand","true":true}
