Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the worst Star Wars movie ever next to TFA. I thought I was watching a Sci-Fi Tv series from the 90's. Thank you Disney now I know not to waste any money on new Star Wars projects if they are now all going to be this bad. I can not believe the critics reviews on this they must be on drugs or must be on Disney's payroll. I feel sorry for George Lucas who has to witness his creation turning into this. The story wis just SJW garbage and a bad story. I am officially done with Star Wars the series for me ends at the prequels and the expanded universe books that have a better story after Jedi.","true":true}
