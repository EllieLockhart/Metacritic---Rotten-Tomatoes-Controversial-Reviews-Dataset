Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The plot runs from disjointed to incoherent and is loaded with overbearing feminist messaging.  Men appear to be testosterone poisoned idiots and previous heroes are trashed or become irrelevant.  People in my row fell asleep. Special effects\\, filming and CGI were excellent but the acting and story never really came together.  In the end\\, I just wanted the Empire to win and put an end to my misery.","true":true}
