{"101487":155343,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-26","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My feelings on this movie are solidly mixed.  I think I liked it despite itself simply because it was a decent popcorn munching\\, fun\\, action and CGI filled flick that added more to the Star Wars universe.  After all\\, I grew up on Star Wars and have been a life long fan.  So\\, it seems almost like sacrilege to say bad things about it.  But\\, unfortunately\\, there are plenty of bad things to say along with the aforementioned good things.  These negatives would be:\\n\\n1)  The glaring plot hole that is Supreme Leader Snoke.  Where did he come from?  How did he become the leader of the First Order and manage to build it to be equal with the former Empire in just 30 years or so?  How did he get such immense (dare I say...unequalled) power over the force?  Who trained him?  Etc.  This is the biggest hole in all of the series to date.\\n\\n2)  A horrible disservice is done to the character of Luke Skywalker.  The very person on whom the whole Star Wars universe was centered -- The New Hope -- fizzled and was totally underwhelming for almost the entire movie.  Unlike all of his old\\, wise\\, calm\\, measured\\, brave\\, sacrificial\\, confidence inspiring\\, big picture thinking\\, Jedi predecessors\\, he came off as afraid\\, rash\\, childish\\, needing to be led around and helped in making decisions\\, etc.  It was just a sad moment for all of Star Wars.  Thankfully\\, he got a few minutes at the end to redeem himself.\\n\\n3)  George Lucas set out to make a good story.....and he did.  These new writers\/directors set out to make a political statement and then try to build a story around it.  Unfortunately\\, that statement is decisively Hollywood-esque.  As a matter of fact\\, one entire story arc in the movie\\, which turns out to serve no purpose whatsoever to the main plot\\, seems to have been made only to say that wealthy people are bad and should be destroyed\\, and that people who own horses (or other animals that are used in competition) are pure evil.  Forget the fact that almost every racehorse owner in the world who pays huge money for their horses\\, absolutely treats them with the best care.  Other ideas that subtly or not so subtly pop up have to do with vegetarianism (don't eat meat) and strong feminism.  While strong female leaders are good and have been in other Star Wars movies\\, this particular movie seemed to go to real extremes to show  strong females juxtaposed with weak male characters.  The women have to rescue the men\\, beg them to get involved in the good fight\\, stop them from running away\\, and put them in their place every chance they get.  The strong men who really want to be brave are shown to be reckless and irresponsible.  One of the most heroic men in the movie (Poe) gets demoted\\, slapped\\, told off\\, put in the brig\\, and shot (stunned) by his superior female officers.  The two highest ranking officers even have a short conversation about him like two mothers would have regarding a young teenage son\\, despite the fact that one of the women probably isn't much older than he\\, and despite the fact that Poe has done amazing things for the Alliance.  Every high ranking person on the alliance is female and almost every heroic person of consequence is female.  Nothing wrong with strong females\\, but they should find more balance......balance to the force.  :-)  \\n\\n4)  Kylo Ren acts like a petulant child.  As the new Supreme Leader\\, there is nothing about him that commands fear or respect like the Emperor\\, Darth Vader\\, or Snoke.  He's just not very convincing as an evil leader.\\n\\n5)  Bombs DROPPING in space.  Nuff said!\\n\\n6)  Useless and wasted time on story arcs that amount to nothing.  Finn and Rose go on a wild goose chase that contributes nothing to the end result.  Poe holds a mutiny that amounts to nothing and has his superior officer tell him what his other superior officer could have told him to begin with.  Kylo Ren\\, Luke and Yoda all spend a lot of time throughout the movie talking about \\\"burning to the ground\\\" the past and all the old Jedi holy books and wisdom....only to show that Rey snuck them into the Millennium Falcon at the end.  The Alliance spends the whole movie fleeing only to decide to do what they could have done from the outset with one of their larger ships (i.e. ram the bad guys with a light speed bullet).  Basically\\, its almost as if the movie spent more time on things that didn't matter than it did on things that did matter.\\n\\nSo\\, if you are a big Star Wars fan\\, go see it\\, eat your popcorn\\, drink your Coke\\, enjoy the new CGI creatures\\, planets\\, and special effects.  But don't expect much in the way of continuity to the overall \\\"spirit\\\" of Star Wars.","true":true}
