Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not going to say this was the worst film I've seen in a while\\, but it is the most disappointing one. Rian Johnson has taken a sharp left turn with The Last Jedi\\, running over the old fandom in the process.  Between bizarre story choices\\, blatant continuity errors\\, and weird pacing\\, This isn't just a bad Star Wars movie\\, its a lackluster film in general.","true":true}
