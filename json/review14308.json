Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I grew up loving Luke\\, Han\\, and Leia and the robots. Now\\, Han is murdered by his own son and Leia flies through the vacuum of space and Luke nearly kills his nephew in his sleep? No thanks\\, Disney. These are not only not good Star Wars stories\\, they are not even good stories. I will never watch Disney Star Wars again. You will not get my hard-earned money for your tripe.","true":true}
