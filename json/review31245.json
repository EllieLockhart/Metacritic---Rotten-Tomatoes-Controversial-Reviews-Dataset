Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many reviews here say that it is either brilliant or it sucks. I think its just good. Admittedly not the greatest star wars movie. Nevertheless it was something fresh and different\\, with no death stars. It really felt that after a long time Star Wars was going in a new direction that I liked\\, such a shame it was undermined by The Rise of Skywalker. It could have been a four and a half but the racing and casino sequence was boring and unneeded.","true":true}
