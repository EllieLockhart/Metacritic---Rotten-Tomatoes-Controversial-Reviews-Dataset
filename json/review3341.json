Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Being my first Star Wars movie that I have seen I generally enjoyed the viewing of it. I went into this movie blind I never knew what to expect  and I was very impressed! I have heard people hating on it for no reason and sending death threats to the creators or actors\/actresses. I don't understand why everyone feels like they have to make their opinions fact when they shouldn't be taken as anything but opinions! Anyways great movie 10\/10 would see again!","true":true}
