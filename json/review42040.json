Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie makes me sad. First there is a franchise fatigue among fans\\, and they need to raise their game to refresh the audience second the makers are killing off the old characters to bring in younger ones to overcome that fatigue\\, and third the new characters are socical justice warrior -ized with \\\"Mary Sue\\\" super abilities when from a preferred background\\, or with dislikable traits when from other backgrounds. Shame on the makers for allowing this to happen. I( hope your target audience fail to jjump onboard your SJW train\\, and you've burned your existing fans trying this stuint. We were So disappointed we actually burst into laughter during the showing at the more silly SJW moments. The popcorn was good\\, but R we going to see this again? Not gonna happen. also the pro reviews are browbeaten into submission. trust the audience reviews folks - at least until the pros wake themselves up and stop covering for Disneys' SJW failings.","true":true}
