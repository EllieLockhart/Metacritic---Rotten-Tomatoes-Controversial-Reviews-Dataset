Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There have been a lot of problems with the new movies (most seem to stem from Disney's decision to ton a ton of plot in their new replacement expanded universe books and games).\\n\\nI enjoyed this film a lot despite Fin's pointless side plot (it came across as just something for him to be doing this film) and frustrating assertion that the force creates balance (Kylo getting strong would create an equally strong Light Sider\\, why what about Snoke?).\\n\\nEp 7 was just a rehash\\, while Ep 8 felt like a big step forward.","true":true}
