Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not Star Wars. I don't know what it is. Bad story told bad. Everyone does stupid things just to move the story along. The story arc is anticlimatic in several ways. And now the force (or as we no longer need years of training just feelings- the FEELS) users are basicly Gods. The First Order forget they are military over and over. The humour is misplaced. Its a disney poster child for disney values with love to fight fascism meanwhile look at our child soldiers and sucicide attacks...WTF. i am out. Life long fan lost. Good luck to those who stay for the death by a thousand bad story cuts.","true":true}
