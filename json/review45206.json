Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unnecessary long\\, bloated movie of attempted comedy\\, pointless to antithetical subplots\\, and most jarringly\\, continuity errors which destroy the lore\\, and open up holes in previous movies. Characters are killed off without knowing their backstory\\, Luke's behavior is poorly explained\\, and even Yoda makes an appearance for no reason.\\n\\nLooks pretty.","true":true}
