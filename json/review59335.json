However her story is plain and isn't anything much more but an ordinary revenge journey. She is conflicted almost by anything during the adventure whether it's her closed ones telling her to abandon the revenge or a few minor flashbacks that make her quit.\r\rAbby\\, who is immediately being antagonized by the game in the first hour\\, is trying to be redeemed with her own story. Players then should have an idea on how she feels. Her story is more diverse than Ellie's but the characters involved with Abby are not likeable and doesn't make the players invest more interest in them. You simply cannot make players to love the bad guy! Even if you give her an entire story on how she saves other people it still cannot be justified with how she brutally kills someone who players love the most from the first game.\r\rThe best part of the game for me was the relationship of Ellie and Joel. We get to see many emotional moments and even the following confrontation about Joel's decision from the last game. These flashbacks look like some form of a grief present for a death that was written quite badly. I still believe that Joel should have died in a proper way than simply being bashed by a golf club. Perhaps it's just the game's main intention as not everything is your cliche superhero game\\, many characters just simply die.\r\rEnding is unfortunately disappointing. It feels prolonged rather than completed. Ellie didn't achieve anything but loss and Abby is the only character who would benefit from this fiasco. All things aside this is definitely not a bad game\\, it just cannot live up to the hype or the quality of the first game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
