Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Gutted...Disney just ruined Star Wars. Don\u2019t know what they were thinking. It\u2019s just another movie\\, feel like a stand alone. If that was you purpose\\, you got it. Movie is a like a blooper reel of the Last Jedi. Movie felt very flat. Maybe critics saw a different movie? I want to see the good one...Disney the force is not strong with you. Definitely went to the dark side\\, money making machine","true":true}
