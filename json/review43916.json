Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Though The Last Jedi was spectacular at times\\, with beautiful scenes\\, and very surprising twists and turns\\, it really sidelined the Star Wars franchise as a whole\\, and the strong reputation of it's most prized originals. It was plagued with awkward dialogue\\, terribly cheesy scenes\\, poorly written plot\\, and undeveloped characters. But most importantly of all\\, it failed to deliver what even the most nominal fans craved. After it all\\, The Last Jedi left me caring less of the revived franchise\\, as it's clear now that Disney has ended Star Wars as we knew it\\, and for the worse.","true":true}
