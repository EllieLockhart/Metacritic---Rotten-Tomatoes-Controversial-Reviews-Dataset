Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first of the Star Wars franchise to saturate itself with that which everyone only talks about in the other outings: The Force. Duh. It's all anybody talks about\\, but hardly seen enough\\, used enough. But this one investigates just a little\\, eh? About time. And what about The Force? Does ability to access it's power guarantee happiness\\, for instance? Nooooooo\\, and the story follows those who can do so\\, and those poor souls who can't\\, making it the best Star Wars since ... The Empire Strikes Back. All this\\, and the set-up for what comes next. Well done indeed.","true":true}
