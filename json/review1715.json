Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a saturday night fun popcorn movie\\, this film was enjoyable in that aspect but as a Star Wars movie and second part of a trilogy\\, it failed miserably. Too many holes and inconsistancies in the story. The movie also didn't know if it wanted to be a sequel or a stand alone movie\\, resulting in the story being a total mess. A very low point for the franchise.","true":true}
