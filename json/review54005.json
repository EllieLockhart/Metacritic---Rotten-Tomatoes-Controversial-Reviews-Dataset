Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I bumped this up half a star* because I feel like this movie is suffering from Star Wars fatigue\\, or something. It seems like people are falling all over themselves to hate it for some reason I can't quite figure out. Don't get me wrong\\, it's not going to change your life. It's not the best thing ever. But it's competent\\, fun\\, and as about as good a Star Wars movie as I think we can hope for at this stage.\\n\\n*I then bumped it right back down half a star because of the disservice I feel it does to at least one character. I really feel like that charcter deserved better\\, and more thoughtful treatment\\, and that it was a serious misstep.","true":true}
