Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The jokes are bad\\, the plot is paper thin\\, and questionable (to put it lightly) directorial decisions mistake \\\"gotcha\\\" moments for solid storytelling (e.g.\\, Leia surviving in the vacuum of space\\, Holdo's nonsensically secretive \\\"plan\\\"). Too often the film comes across overly political and\\, more importantly\\, unfaithful to its source material. Worst of all\\, the film's narrow focus never allows the viewer to feel immersed in what should be a galactic-size conflict. It's just bad. The film wants to be irreverent; it wants to be Guardians of the Galaxy; and it wants to self-consciously \\\"subvert expectations.\\\" In the end\\, it just felt as if the director tried too hard to make a film that Hollywood would love without actually caring what fans would like\\, which\\, I suppose\\, one should have seen coming when the director actually admitted he hopes half the people who see his movies leave the theatre thinking\\, \\\"That's the worst movie I have ever seen!\\\" Well\\, pretty close to mission accomplished.","true":true}
