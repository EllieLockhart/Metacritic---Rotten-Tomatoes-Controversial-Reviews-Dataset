Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The action scenes and cgi looked nice. Plot has way to may holes in it\\, or stuff that just doesn't make any sense. One part seemed to be a political statement and that was the only reason for it to be in the movie. I feel the director and the ceo of lucas films\\, don't care about Star Wars (1 - 7) when it comes to cannon\\, lore\\, or telling a story. They are just milking the cash cow called \\\"Star Wars\\\". Same goes for EA making the Star Wars Battlefront 2\\, with the issue of buying loot crates \/ pay to win\/ gambling.","true":true}
