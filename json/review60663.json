Might've been good on its own merits\\, but to call this a Last of Us game\\, you carry a certain weight with that name\\, and the ideas of this revenge tale just don't land. I felt nothing for these characters\\, and barely even got to know them. A far cry from the well written story of the first game. I feel for anybody that pre-ordered this expecting one thing and being blindsided by the devs need to \\\"subvert player expectations\\\". Combat can be fun and designs are beautiful\\, but thats not enough to warrant people to play this. Ultimately its a story narrative\\, and it fails in that regard to being interesting\\, or even furthering the characterization of these characters.My low score is reflective of the deceit I felt from the trailers\\, I never looked at the leaks cause I trusted naughtdog to deliver. What they gave me was half a story\\, no multiplayer\\, and death of great & new characters for shock value that neither carries the story or draws you. I hope to god they never make a sequel.
