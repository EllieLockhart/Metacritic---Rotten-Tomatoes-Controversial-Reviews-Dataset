Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What can I say that hasn't already been said by hundreds of YouTubers and die hard fans. When I first watched this movie in the cinema\\, I thought \\\"meh\\, had a couple half decent moments\\\" the film dragged on A LOT at times and I found the characters less engaging this time around than The Force Awakens. \\nThe big thing that bothered me\\, like many others\\, was the heavy handed Feminist agenda being rammed down our throats via Admiral Purple Hair. It felt so overly forced  that it took me right out of the movie and had me rolling my eyes. I simply could not enjoy this movie\\, I wanted to\\, but I couldn't. While TFA was decent\\, and had me smiling at the nods to the Original Trilogy and even somewhat likeable new characters in Rey and Finn\\, this one fell flat completely. \\nKeep your political agenda out of Star Wars\\, this is supposed to be a space epic about good vs evil\\, not a social commentary on Feminists vs \\\"The Patriarchy.\\\" Bleh.","true":true}
