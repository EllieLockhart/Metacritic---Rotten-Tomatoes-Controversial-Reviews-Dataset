Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have always loved Star Wars and it was so sad to see this film ruined by Hollywood's insistence in shoving feminist propaganda down our throats. Also Rey is an amazing all-powerful God\\, she is master of the universe.","true":true}
