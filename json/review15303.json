Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I listened to the spoilers (which I won't provide) and read the negative reviews as soon as the rage began...and after having seen it\\, I don't get any of them. AT ALL. So this is a review against those who hated (aspects of) it.\\n\\nTo me\\, all the dislikes are either petty\\, express a want for the movie to be something different\\, or completely disregard the basis of the Star Wars story lines. Star Wars is beloved by so many\\, yet there are some who don't get sci-fi films\\, so they don't like it. But Star Wars isn't a sci-fi flick (it's an epic story in space)\\, I don't get how sci-fi purists would bother picking apart  the physical flaws in it. Explosions with sound have existed in nearly every space movie I've ever seen\\, for the same reason glints exist in animation: so it's more \\\"believable\\\" (read: less 2-dimensional and more entertaining).\\n\\nI didn't see the political commentary\\, possibly because I get lost in movies\/stories. Do yourself a favor if you can\\, and leave the analysis involuntarily injected into our daily lives at the door of the theater.\\n\\nAs for a little levity\\, some familiar imagery and dialogue\\, it's fun\\, not destructive. I'm was there to be entertained...and I was.\\n\\nStar Wars has always been about the struggle between good and evil. I guess that's polarizing \\, and people have expectations about how that's supposed to play out. Isn't that our own struggle -- our own want to have absolutes and not have the struggle come to us?","true":true}
