Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"It\u2019s pretty\\, it has funny moments. It has unique styles of Ellie being more stealth vs Abby being brutal and rough. However the game retcons the first one. Characters make stupid decisions and it feels as if you are forced into situations and places the writer has shoved you in rather then let you pick or understand. Example- in the first game it\u2019s made clear that the surgery to get a vaccine is not 100% guaranteed and that it\u2019s a shot in the dark that we must take to at least try. So you can understand why Joel did what he did. You can agree or disagree with it but you at least understand and get his reasoning and motivation. In the sequel a key turning point is when after you kill Nora and get the location of where Abby is... you decide to get tommy and take Dina back to jackson to give birth in a controlled proper environment. When given the choice of following Jesse to Tommy\u2019s potential location or stealing a boat and going after Abby.... you are forced to go after Abby. After killing Owen and his pregnant gf you leave your map behind with your location circled on it. It\u2019s frustrating because the average player would say \u201cget the map\u201d \u201cdon\u2019t circle your exact base\u201d anyways you killed all Abby friends\\, you found tommy and everyone is ready to go and yet Ellie still is set on going after Abby.  To sum this rant up. It\u2019s very very frustrating when well written and developed characters are forced in making stupid decisions and dragging you along with them. Simply put it makes the game un enjoyable and I\u2019d rather just speed run it listening to music because I no longer care about what happens to the characters or what they do. Because bad decisions and selfish choice after selfish choice just gets really really annoying. It\u2019s a 4\/10 because this game is the ideal - put this on to show your friends what a PS4 pro can really do and how far games have come. It\u2019s a tech demo.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
