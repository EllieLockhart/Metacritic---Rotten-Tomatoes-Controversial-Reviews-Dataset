Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Is it the best Star Wars Film\\, maybe it's my Love of Empire Strikes Back but I'd say no it's not. But I would say it's up there in the top 4 at least. This is not the Star Wars I grew up watching and that is a good thing. Everyone who complained about how Force Awakens was too much like A New Hope should like the fact that this film is not a retread of Empire Strikes Back. I loved this film and will look forward to seeing this film again and again.","true":true}
