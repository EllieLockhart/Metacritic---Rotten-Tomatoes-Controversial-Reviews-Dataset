Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a great movie. However\\, the first 10 mins were absolute bs. I almost started screaming\\, it was that bad. But overall I really enjoyed this movie. It was extremely overwhelming\\, and not meant at all for anyone who hasn\u2019t seen TFA. The effects were top notch. Character development wasn\u2019t too terrible\\, but wasn\u2019t amazing. (Spoiler) The way they introduced some characters and then killed them off after you make a connection to them felt wrong. Snoke was.... idk but that whole thing was odd. And he was wayyy too OP to not have some sort of background info on. This movie\\, at many points in it\\, could\u2019ve completely ended the entire series and been left at that. And while you\u2019re watching the movie\\, it feels like the third in the trilogy\\, but it only makes sense afterwards that it belongs in the middle. This movie will be debated about for years. (MAJOR SPOILER) At the end when it said \u201cIn loving memory of our Princess\\, Carrie Fisher\u201d I burst into tears. I think she would\u2019ve loved this movie. ","true":true}
