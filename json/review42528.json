Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was an abomination. The humor was ridiculous and mood shattering\\, no mood killing. The plot holes were massive\\, so big you could fit snoke's ship through them. Then\\, the ridiculous political messaging was insulting. Not because i care about men always being the hero\\, or because i particularly love capitalism\\, but i don't want my face rubbed in anyone's political agenda without my express consent. \\n\\nI hated this movie.","true":true}
