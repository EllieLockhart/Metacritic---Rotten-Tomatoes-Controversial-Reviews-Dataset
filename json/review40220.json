Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not the film you're looking for.  Plot holes\\, sub plot tangents that go nowhere and mean nothing. Jedi story made more meaningless the the Jar Jar film.  Overacted to the point it seems like a spoof. Almost walked out a few times.  I held onto hope. I was disappointed.","true":true}
