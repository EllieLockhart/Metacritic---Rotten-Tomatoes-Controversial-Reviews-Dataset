Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are a whole lot of issues with this movie\\, many of which stem from poor writing.  Little is truly accomplished in the movie from a plot perspective.  By the end of the movie\\, most characters are basically in the same place they were at the start.  There is very little character development outside of Poe and Luke.  The villains\\, are terribly lackluster in the movie and their use of them is even more pitiful.  Kylo Ren is the worst villain in any of the Star Wars movies\\, certainly no Vader or Palpatine.  The prequels villains are heads and shoulders above him as well.  Several paths existed for many characters to take that were never explored.  Another major issue is that the movie feels very disjointed from the Force Awakens (which I wasn't a big fan of due its plot line cloning of New Hope).  So many aspects set up Force Awakens are simply discarded  or easily dismissed.  You can really feel the fact that a different director made this movie compared to Force Awakens.\\n\\nThe only parts of the movie I really enjoyed were the parts with Luke.  Visual effects were also very good.","true":true}
