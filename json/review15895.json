Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love this film. I loved the action\\, I loved the editing\\, I loved the effects and the story and the acting. And that lightsaber battle....it's the best lightsaber battle in the entire Star Wars saga(and that includes episode IX) We didn't deserve Rian Johnson.","true":true}
