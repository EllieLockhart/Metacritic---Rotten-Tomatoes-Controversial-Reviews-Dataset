Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic. Unlike any Star Wars movie and some will hate it for that reason. Brave narrative and better acted then anything in the Orginal Trilogy\\, both Hamill's and Fisher's best performances. Fast paced\\, fun and action packed. However it is Marmite\\, you'll either love it or hate it.","true":true}
