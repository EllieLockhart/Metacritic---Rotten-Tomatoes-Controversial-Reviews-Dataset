Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disrespectful to the original Space Opera hero: Luke Skywalker. The writing appears to be a poor first draft that was never revised or revisited. Amazing effects do little today to hold up a forced politically correct narrative where minority characters are pushed into the foreground despite developing no distinguishing characteristics or history. Numerous moments are stolen directly from Episode 5 & 6 including Hoth battle\\, Luke and Vader redemption convo\\, super villain overconfidence and mocking hero scene\\, and a poor version of a reluctant Jedi master training a keen apprentice and dark side cave scene. Very lazy work catered to mindless buffoons who enjoy watching explosions and lightsabers move around. Probably the most lazy Star Wars ever made because it adds literally nothing original to the franchise and has too many cheesy near death moments which have become a staple of braindead millennial cinema.","true":true}
