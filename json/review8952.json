Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From a critic point of view\\, I'm surprised they rated this movie so high. TFA was not a good star wars saga movie but at least they made it well with less jokes\\, ok new characters and tone. This movie however was edited poorly\\, shot amazingly\\, but with no good plot and a subverting expectation chaotic 2 hours which didn't work out well for the story. Characters didn't develop\\, Rey became a mary sue\\, Finn did nothing special and from a star wars fan i would say this disrespects the saga and franchise so much.\\n\\nIt was made better then TPM and AOTC but it's the worst star wars movie. bad jokes\\, bad tone\\, bad story and script. Only good thing for it was the emotion\\, cinematography\\, special effects and models.","true":true}
