Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson just ruined Star Wars or wS that Disney that\u2019s ultimately responsible? Terrible movie that\u2019s a galaxy far away from the first 8 films\\, not that The Force Awakens was much better but this has set a new low\\, just ridiculous in parts and totally unnecessary scenes with poor acting\\, it\u2019s just all rushed and silly\\, this really makes The Phantom Menace look good\\, I mean there\u2019s no point to the story which is what makes the movie ","true":true}
