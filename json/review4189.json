Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By far not only one of the worst SW movies\\, but a very mediocre sci-fi movie whatsoever. Inconsistent\\, illogical\\, with no credibility in creating any of its characters it seems chaotic and random not only as a part of the saga\\, but also as a stand-alone movie. It is disrespectful to the die-hard fans as it contradicts everything we have been used to\\, and for no reason\\, as the plot is just shredded into random pieces. If 8 out of 10 main characters had been killed in the first 15 minutes\\, nothing would have changed in the story; it gives something away\\, doesn't it? Not the SW we used to know and just a bad movie.","true":true}
