Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just wish I walked out knowing more about Kylo Ren and Rey! The way Director Rian Johnson ended Luke really broke my heart!! I waited yearssss to see what JEDI MASTER Luke has to offer and I got nothing! Luke is a Legend and it should've never ended the way it did. But... overall I enjoyed the movie!","true":true}
