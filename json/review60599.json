An exercise in finding empathy and resolution in a broken world populated by extremely flawed characters. A title that demands self-reflection on how we condition ourselves to selectively elevate and suppress flaws and virtues of people based on entrenched biases.\rA game about the dangers of emotionally missing a forest for its trees that hilariously (yet predictably) translated in a vocal and immature critical backlash from people guilty of that same mistake.\rIgnore the silly user score.

It would be a shame if this level of maturity\\, respect for the audience's intelligence and courage went to waste with no follow-up.\rBuy it. A joy to play and a story that stays with you long after the console is turned off.\rA classic to be remembered.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
