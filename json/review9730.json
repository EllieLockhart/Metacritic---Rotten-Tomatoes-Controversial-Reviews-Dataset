Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good: The Storyline was not a cOmplete rehash and was\/Repeat of past star wars TitlEs\\n\\nBad: utterly Wooden acting of daisY ridLey. finn was used for ComIc relief - painful to watch. SCANDALOUS TREATMENT OF LUKE SKYWALKER.\\n\\nOvErall a forgettable set of Characters and obvious political messaging. If somebodY wants to Raise Political messages please deliver a waTchable movie in the process.","true":true}
