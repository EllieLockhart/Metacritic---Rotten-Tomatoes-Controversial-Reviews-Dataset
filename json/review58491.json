Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An absolute waste of the franchise. Plot holes\\, boring subplot\\, and even more dule ham fisted new characters while killing off some of the more interesting previous characters (Phasma\\, Snoke\\, Luke) with little to no payoff for the build from the previous entry. Floating Leia through space\\, and more nonsensical trash built ONCE AGAIN off the back of a better film. Being strikingly similar to now Empire Strikes Back shows how little direction and inability the new directors have to innovate without rehashing an old story. It's a mess\\, but more insulting as a fan\\, it's lazy and blatantly shoves how little they care about the core fandom\\, instead favoring big budget appeal. Can't be too surprised with Disney being behind it\\, but moving forward put someone with talent\\, passion\\, and an understanding of the universe to keep from making another bloated yet hollow attempt to sell tickets instead of making a memorable experience for its' viewers.","true":true}
