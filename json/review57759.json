Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very enjoyable experience. I know people may not enjoy the evolution of the series but it actually hit on some great concepts and touched on struggles we can all relate to. The storyline and pacing wasn't perfect\\, but they didn't try to over-polish things and were not afraid to take risks (doing the unexpected)! I like that. it's bold and very much needed in an age of predictable sequels. ","true":true}
