Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just the worst. Awful movie. Never seen star wars before and i'm not going to bother going back and watching the others. It was horrible\\, the plot made no sense and the humor was so bad I laughed at it because it was so dumb. Seems like they took some random person from the streets and had them write it. Do not recommend it","true":true}
