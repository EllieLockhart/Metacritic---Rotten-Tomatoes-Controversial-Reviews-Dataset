Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was a fantastic addition to the Star Wars universe and by far the most shocking since empire strikes back.\\nI understand if some people my not like the twist that takes place as they might feel in renders some of force awakens pointless. But for me it actually strengthens kylo rend character so much it was fantastic. And it was the last thing I expected.\\nGreatest performance by Marc Hamil as Luke Skywalkwr. Emotional and gritty. Didn't expect it to be so.\\nA bit long for some in the casino scene but I loved it as it extends the universe. \\nThe use of the force in New was is great. We can't just stick to what the force was on the 80s.\\n\\nI understand why some hate it. But for me I think it went such a different way it shocked people beyond comfort.\\n\\nLoved it!\\n\\n3rd joint favourite Star Wars with Return of jedi. After Empire strikes back and New Hope.","true":true}
