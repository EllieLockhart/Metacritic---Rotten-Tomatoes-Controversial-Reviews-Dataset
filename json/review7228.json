Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Entertaining but ultimately empty film. Adam Driver is great;it's great to see  ark Hamill\\, and  Daisy Ridley does well with Rey.  There are some good special effects. But overall it is long \\, the plot and  other characters are weak\\, and the story doesn't move forward. The film keeps telling us to forget the past- so I guess I should forget how inspirational Star Wars was in the past. This was so much wasted potential.","true":true}
