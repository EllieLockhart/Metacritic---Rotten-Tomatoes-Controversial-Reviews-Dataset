Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i really hated this film. so many scenes were clumsily executed\\, so many tone-death attempts of humour\\, so many plot-holes\\, a terrible sub-plot. lukes transformation makes no sense. he was an optimistic guy who risked his life because he saw the \\\"light\\\" even in his terrible father. then\\, he saw \\\"darkness\\\" in ben solo\\, the son of his sister and his best friend\\, and was on the verge of executing the child in his sleep... what???\\nso many missed opportunities\\, too. we didn't even get to see luke grief over han solos death.\\n\\ni'm really sad this movie was made.","true":true}
