Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was a brave and stirring movie. Rian Johnson has saved Star Wars from going stale by being unafraid to do something bold and take risks. Mark Hamill's performance is almost unbelievably good and carries much of the weight of the film.","true":true}
