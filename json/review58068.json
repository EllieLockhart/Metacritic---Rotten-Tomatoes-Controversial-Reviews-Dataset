Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With this movie\\, Rian Johnson truly gives us a different star wars than we've seen before. It challenges TFAs characters and challenges us with a different type of storytelling. One that is more cognizant of how people actually evolve\\, and learn and become heroes. Heroes aren't born\\, they are created through a series of failures.\\n\\nThis was always supposed to be the darker and challenging chapter. Yet\\, people are complaining about the fact that it is different and challenging. They complain that their favorite characters are actually facing failure for the first time. Despite the fact that these same people complained that TFA was too much like the OT\\, they now complain that this movie is not enough like the OT.\\n\\nI think this movie needs to be seen at least twice to truly appreciate what Rian Johnson is doing.
