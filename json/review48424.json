Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Without a doubt one of the greatest Star Wars films of all time. Sticks to the Star Wars tradition of cheesy humor\\, wholesome pew-pew action\\, and having a fair share of plot holes\\, but adds some much needed twists to the formula. \\n\\nNo longer simply a stock recitation of the Hero's Journey monomyth with broad brush strokes of dark and light\\, this film delves deep into the questions of what it takes to unshackle the world from the path\\, and what we need to preserve going forward. As a bonus\\, none of the fun\\, style\\, or humor is sacrificed in the process of adding that complexity. Nearly flawless\\, go watch it 5 times (in 3D)!","true":true}
