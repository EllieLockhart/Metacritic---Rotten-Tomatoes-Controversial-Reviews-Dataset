Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie brings me back to episode one. This is one of the worst star wars movies. Social justice warriors kind of movie\\, this is why the critics love it. PETA will love it. Feminist will love it. Atheist will love it. Communist will love it. This movie is so preachy. \\nAdditionally I felt how long this movie is. This movie wound up making characters like rey and po worse\\, unlikable in this movie. What was done to luke was atrocious. Plot holes galore. \\nWTF with luke milking from the tit of animal. Was this another feminist symbol. \\nWhy watch the 3d movie the villians are idiots.\\nsoooooo many unanswered questions.","true":true}
