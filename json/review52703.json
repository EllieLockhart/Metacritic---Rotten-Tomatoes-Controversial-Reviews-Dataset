Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"all the people that say this is a bad movie are the tipical  fanboys that want all in their way or else put it as trash. they are just mad because his own\\, REY\/SNOOKE fan theory\\, was throw to the trash can\\, where it belongs. Dont even put atention to it go and see the movie by yourself. For me is a really good movie with a few flaws\\, and im a huge StarWars fan from the begining.","true":true}
