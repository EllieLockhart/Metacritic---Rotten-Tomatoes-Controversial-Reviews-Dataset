Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The story was a mess\\, it was like they had a million ideas on a white board and tried to fit them into a cohesive story. The only decent part of the movie was the parts with Luke.","true":true}
