Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I absolutely loved this game just as much as the first. I won't spoil too much in this.I get some people aren't happy about their favourite character being killed off or playing as the person who is killed him but I loved it.People say one action doesn't make up for a person's mistakes in the past so they can't forgive abby but they are quickly forgetting all the things Joel did in between losing his daughter and saving Ellie in order to survive. Her story arch mirrors that of Joel's in some ways. We see both characters get consumed with hate and wanting revenge. Abby gets to take that revenge but then she is left with guilt and is viewed differently by her friends and she doesn't like that. She has nightmares of the past. She then gets saved by the unlikeliest of people\\, her groups enemies. But she soon finds a purpose again and goes off on her own little adventure. Whilst as Ellie you take the journey to get her revenge and you see where it takes her along the way and how it consumes and changes her. You see both of them go through so much and lose a lot. The game has you constantly up and down with your emotions\\, naughty dog took risks with the game and I think they have done it wonderfully. The graphics are spectacular as ever and the level of accessibility for other gamers who may need these are just beyond what you'd expect. Naughty Dog you have done amazing with this.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
