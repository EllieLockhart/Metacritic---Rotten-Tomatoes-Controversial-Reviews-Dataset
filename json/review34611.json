Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The cast did the best they could with a garbage script that ignores the Star Wars universe's logic for the sake of shock value (Nobody has ever 'run out of fuel' in the history of Star Wars until it's needed to show the resistance is in a bad way). Truly sad for Mark Hamill not having a chance to really show us the Luke Skywalker we all know he would have actually been. This would have been a fine movie as a stand alone in a universe Rian Johnson created\\, but 'killing the past' of Star Wars to try to show the strength of these new heroes isn't good screenwriting\\, it's just lazy and shocking for the sake of shocking. As far as I am concerned\\, the Star wars universe ended after The Return of the Jedi\\, which is sad\\, because I thought The Force Awakens was good\\, a nice little love-note to the old series (even if a bit redundant).","true":true}
