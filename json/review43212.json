Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This Star Wars movie dropped the ball in so many ways. Plot holes\\, character development that doesn't make any sense. Dropped subplots from the episode 7. In fact\\, it felt like Johnson did not see the Force Awakens before making this movie. What a let down.","true":true}
