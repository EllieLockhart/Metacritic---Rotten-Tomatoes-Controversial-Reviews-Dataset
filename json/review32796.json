Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi was beautifully written\\, and while it did not go as expected\\, it was better than I could have hoped. As a lifelong Star Wars fan who grew up in the 1980's with the Original Trilogy\\, I am absolutely supportive of the new direction this new trilogy has taken. I have seen this film twice and I may have to watch it again before I buy it on BluRay. Bravo to Rian Johnson and the entire cast of Star Wars: The Last Jedi.","true":true}
