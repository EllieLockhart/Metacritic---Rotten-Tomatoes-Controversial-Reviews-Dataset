Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I feel like Disney wants to take a Space Opera and make it a Space Comedy.  But they fail at doing it.  I didn't enjoy this movie as much as I wish I would have.  I left with a crappy empty feeling that there were no answers (again) and Disney keeps trying to reinvent Star Wars itself... Which they need to be careful with because many of the franchises fans played with the video games and loved the original movies and feel like this just isn't quite the same thing anymore.","true":true}
