Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a long time Star Wars fan\\, this film has left a bitter taste - it's apparent that the director and writers don't understand and didn't take the time or effort to respect the original trilogy characters\\, the lore\\, or the themes of the original films.\\n\\nI'm all for taking Star Wars boldly into a new era with new characters\\, but the way it's been handled is very poor.\\n\\nToo many plot holes\\, too much forced humour which was notably out of place\\, bad writing\\, worse character progression and a complete mishandling of cherished characters\\, I'll give the movie 1 star for the visuals\\, but that's as much as it deserves.","true":true}
