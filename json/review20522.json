Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been watching star wars my entire life\\, I watch all of them twice every single year\\, and I have to say\\, I absolutely LOVED The Last Jedi. everything about it felt thought out and well done\\, Mark Hamill was excellent\\, John Boyega's character has seen massive character development\\, Rey's character has also improved greatly\\, Adam driver brings excellent acting and emotion to Kylo Ren's inner turmoil\\, in short\\, the whole cast performed phenomenally\\, and I've already preordered this movie. if you're a star wars fan\\, and have been since the beginning\\, you will love this movie with all your heart","true":true}
