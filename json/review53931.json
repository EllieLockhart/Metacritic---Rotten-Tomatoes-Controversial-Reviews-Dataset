Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Huge star wars fan.   Watched force awakens 7 times in theatres.   I will not watch this one again or purchase it later.   So disappointed in Disney for pushing their agenda and destroying the star wars universe.   Obvious fake reviews from critics afraid to give an honest opinion of the all mighty Disney\\, Lucasfilm\\,  and now FOX\\,  etc.  .   Disney timed that purchase just right!   Its only about the all mighty dollar.  Had a strong opening but they will not get the repeat viewings.  Shame on disney! \\n\\nI really wanted to see Luke kick ass as a powerful Jedi.   Not a hermit that hasn't used the force in years.   \\n\\nWas cool to see yoda.   Here again Disney is changing rules in the force for monetary purpose.   Dead jedi life force can now make lightning strike?   And hit luke on the face?   This opens up new avenues for dead jedi affecting the living universe.   \\n\\nLeia marry poppins scene.    No vacuum in space?   \\n\\nReys hyper Jedi powers with little\/no training.  \\n\\nPushing animal cruelty agenda.    \\n\\nAbout anyone can have the force.   Reys parents are nobody.   Everyone gets a medal.   \\n\\nMen(including Luke)  are idiots.   Women are brave fearless leaders. \\n\\nI could go on and on.  Disney killed starwars.","true":true}
