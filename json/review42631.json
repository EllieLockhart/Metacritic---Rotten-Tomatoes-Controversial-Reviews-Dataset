Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was brutal and I'm still trying to erase this from my head. So many things broken\/wrong with it. I think a solo movie of Jar Jar Binks would rate as low as this one.","true":true}
