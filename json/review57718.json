Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Up until The Last Jedi there was always something I liked about a Star Wars movie even if I didn't like the movie as a whole.  I didn't like Phantom Menace but I did like young Obi-Wan\\, Qui-Gon\\,  Darth Maul\\, and so much more.  But The Last Jedi didn't have anything I liked.  Luke was a pathetic hermit\\, Rose and Finn went on some useless quest\\, Leia can fly like Mary Poppins\\, there are horrible jokes and the Holdo maneuver makes one wonder why it wasn't used all the time in space warfare.  I know the director wanted to subvert expectations and that is okay if you have a stand alone movie\\, but it doesn't work very well in a trilogy.","true":true}
