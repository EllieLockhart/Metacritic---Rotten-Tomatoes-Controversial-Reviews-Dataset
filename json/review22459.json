Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Legit one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This seems to be reflected in the audience score. It's been hilarious watching the \\\"critics\\\" and the media apparatus try to explain away the bad ratings and forcememe this as not being an awful film. Save your money and your memories of the original trilogy.","true":true}
