Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a fan of Star Wars since I saw A New Hope in 1977 and now that I've had a few hours to process The Last Jedi my spoiler free first impression review is this...it's a fun roller coaster ride but I didn't feel the need to get off of it and jump right back in line to ride it again. That being said I felt like The Little Dutch Boy doing my best trying to plug all of the holes in the plot. I give it one ?? and one ??up. I love it and hated it at the same time. That's about all I have to say for now. I do recommend that every fan of the franchise (obviously) go see the movie....Opinions will vary. It's going to be a battle between old school and new school","true":true}
