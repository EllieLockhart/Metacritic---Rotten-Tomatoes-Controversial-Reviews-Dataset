Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is my first review. I am compelled to write because I am just disappointed at how the direction of the saga is being managed. After a great start to the sequel trilogy\\, the new director managed to disrespect that as well as the characters and world building that both the prequel and original trilogy created over six films. Probably the weakest star wars movie uet. Here's hoping that JJ Abrams can right the ship\\, answer any substantial and lingering questions posed in Force  Awakens and tie up not only this new trilogy with the original but with the prequels and the overarching theme of star wars (Life death and redemption of Anakain Skywalker\\, the Skywalker family saga).","true":true}
