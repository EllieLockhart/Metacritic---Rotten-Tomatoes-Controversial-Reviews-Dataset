Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Made up force powers. Hologram projection\\, mind link\\, outer space flight.  Crapped on Skywalker legacy. No character development. Snoke can't sense lightsaber moving RIGHT NEXT to him.  Poe is an idiot. Finn and Rose beyond ridiculous. Slow speed chase boring.  Nothing made sense. Hopefully Chewie was having a nightmare and dreamt this crap and we'll get the real episode VIII next time. SMH.","true":true}
