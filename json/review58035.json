Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Why are there so few black females in this film? I see a white woman is the force using savior super hero\\, while the black man has to settle for the fat Asian and try and suicide attack his ship? \\n\\nWhite women are the generals?   \\nWhite women are the pilots?   \\nWhite women are even the boss storm troopers?      \\n\\nHell the cute cartoon hamsters got more screen time than any black women did.     \\n\\nStar Wars\\, the whiteness unleashed. Wow white people\\, yet again you saved the day. Meanwhile\\, you voted for Roy Moore and Donald Trump. \\n\\nThe Force is now female. White females that is.
