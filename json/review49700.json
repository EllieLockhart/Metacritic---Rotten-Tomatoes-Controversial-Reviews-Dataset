Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow. Where do I even begin. Lazy writing throughout the whole thing. No logic anywhere to be found. Completely inconsistent with what we know about the Star Wars Universe and holy shit is Rey the Mary'est Sue to ever hit the big screen. Luke is considered to be the most powerful Jedi in all of Star Wars at that point in time and Rey bests him in combat. And what the fuck if Luke was just gonna die at the end of his projection WHY NOT JUST HAVE HIM FLY THERE IN HIS XWING TO FACE KYLO HIMSELF! SINCE WHEN DOES RUNNING OUT OF FUEL SLOW SPACESHIPS DOWN! SINCE WHEN CAN LARGE FIRST ORDER VESSELS NOT ABLE TO DETECT SMALL SHOPS AND WHY? WHY ARE YOU CALLING THE REBELS THE \\\"RESISTANCE\\\" WHEN THEY ARE THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONLY LEGALLY AND GALACTICALLY RECOGNIZED GOVERNMENT. \\n\\nTHERES IS SO MUCH MORE WEONG WITH THIS MOVIE WHY","true":true}
