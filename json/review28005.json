Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot holes. Dozens and dozens of plot holes.\\n\\nWasted characters. (ie. Snoke\\, Phasma\\, Finn)\\n\\nRey is even more of a Mary Sue.\\n\\nLuke would never\\, no matter how old a crotchety he gets\\, almost murder his nephew in his sleep.\\n\\nLack of respect for SW mythos. Jedi can now fly through space and shoot lightning decades after their death.\\n\\nThe list goes on and on. I was so disappointed in this movie.","true":true}
