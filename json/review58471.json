Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"a lot can be said about this movie it had some great scenes but lacked suspense too many jokes its star wars it already humor  when a blaster is fired. then there was too many things that didnt make sense unless they were just trying to lengthen the movie\\, like finn trip point less not to mention poe argument an biggest reason off all if luke wanted to die an believe jedi wasnt needed\\, why leave a map to collect his corpse maybe","true":true}
