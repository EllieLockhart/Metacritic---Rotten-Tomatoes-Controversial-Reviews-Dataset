Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"WALT DISNEY IS RUINING THE STARWARS FRANCHISE\\n\\nHaving just seen The Last Jedi I am hoping this is the last Starwars film made by Walt Disney.\\n\\nThe main problem is that the scripting is very poor and there is nothing new in the films. The crystal foxes were about the only new thing in this last film. Walt Disney are being very lazy and really just milking the brand.\\n\\nI.e. 'we are losing all our ships'. What. Useless bit of narrative that is. I can see you are losing all the ships. This telling what was going on happened over\\, and over\\, and over again. Film is a visual medium 'SHOW DONT TELL. \\n\\nDaisy Ridley doesn't have an acting bone in her body. Performances by her just make me and most of the people I went to the film with CRINGE.\\n\\nPOOR SCRIPTING\\, POOR STORY AND POOR ACTING GET IT A 2 OUT OF 10\\n\\nGIVE THE FRANCHISE BACK TO GEORGE LUCAS - IT IS NOT SAFE IN WALT DISNEY'S HANDS.","true":true}
