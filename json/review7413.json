Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\u00c9 uma sequ\u00eancia interessante\\, pois deu mais clareza em como a trama vai seguir. ainda assim\\, ficou uma ideia de mais do mesmo. para os f\u00e3s cl\u00e1ssicos\\, agrada pela nostalgia\\, mas em contrapartida pelo fato de ser muito longo cansa em alguns momentos. trilha sonora e os efeitos especiais estavam \u00f3timos e foram os pontos altos. j\u00e1 as doses de humor sa\u00edram bem fora do tempo.","true":false}
