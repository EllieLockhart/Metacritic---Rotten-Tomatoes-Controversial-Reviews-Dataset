Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson did a BEAUTIFUL job with this movie. His choices were visually stunning and\\, when inspected on a deeper level\\, make the scenes even better. Yes it didn't seem like your usual Star Wars movie but it did feel like a Disney action-packed fairytale\\, something that will leave kids and even adults entranced and inspired. I thought the opening scene with Hux and Poe\\, while funny and cute\\, was not as strong as the rest of the film. Would definitely pay money to see again.","true":true}
