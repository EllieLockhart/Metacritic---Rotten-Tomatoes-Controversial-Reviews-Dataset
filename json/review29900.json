Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rotten Tomatoes is a RIGGED and dishonest system. The audience score is unarguably FAR lower than 50% and the movie is a worthless pile of trash\\, at best. We aren't fooled\\, you evil\\, hypocritical whores.","true":true}
