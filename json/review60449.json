Neil D. Perfectly illustrated the character development and story. If you don\u2019t have the mental to look deeper beyond the surface than I understand why you\u2019d rate this game below its worth.

If you couldn\u2019t tell Ellie was gonna be gay in the first game then you really must lack brain cells. Im sorry some of you had a hard on for virtual character and if she somehow became real she wouldn\u2019t be into you now because she\u2019s gay. Pretty sure she wouldn\u2019t be attracted to incels in the first place bro. Also\\, I loved the ending. It does make sense if you look deeper into it. Ellie found her peace and even though it\u2019s not the peace you were looking for\\, doesn\u2019t make it a bad ending. If I can express this enough\\, PLAY THIS GAME. Take your time and think about the story in a richer sense as you play and you\u2019ll appreciate it. I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better second part. I cannot wait to see what Naughty Dog and Neil. D have in store in the future.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
