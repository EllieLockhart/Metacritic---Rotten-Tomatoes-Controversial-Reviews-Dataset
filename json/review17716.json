Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It could have been epic. It lacked the magic of the force awakens. The fight seens really lacked good direction. FN-2187 vs Captain Phasma blew. The kylo\/rey team fight was terrible and random. So disappointed in the humor. Fin and poe are funny and they should have stuck with just those two being funny. They ruined luke. Rey did not get enough screen time. This is heartbreaking. The director just lacked vision.","true":true}
