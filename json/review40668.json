Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is why I tell everyone never to go to rotten tomatoes for reviews. 90% of  your \\\"critics\\\" are either blind or paid off. If you are a real Star Wars fan there is no way you could give this movie any more than 6\/10.","true":true}
