Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've seen it twice now in the first 24 hours of release and the second watching definitely was better. I fell that Star Wars is going down a more kids route due to all the comedy and cute animals. I got a huge smack in the face by diversity with all the high ranking women in this movie lol. I wish there was more Luke. I wish there was more training of Rey. I wish Kylo Ren wasn't so under powered. I wish that casino planet was just taken out of the movie. I wish I saw lightsabers clash- literally\\, no lightsabers touched in that entire movie lol. Leia flying in space was a bit cringe. The battle on the salt planet wasn't done too well as the rebels must have traveled miles in spacecraft to clash with the approaching First Order but managed to make it back on foot within minutes. Lastly\\, I'm not sure how Kylo and Rey managed to see eachother at the end of the movie when they were connected through Snoke- he was dead at this point. Decent watch\\, although I was pretty taken aback by the amount of comedy first time round. 4 stars.","true":true}
