The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"*Some major spoilers below*Great game. If you loved the first game\\, and hate this game\\, you should really take a look and think why. The main reasons many are upset\\, is the game doesn't go how they want\\, and you play women who do not quite match society norms. People who have reviewed the game who did not even play it through\\, especially those who did not play it at all have been unfair to it\\, and their reviews should be removed.Maybe you just didn't like it for valid reasons\\, but that's the minority from what I've seen.If you played it all and did not like it\\, you are entitled to your opinion\\, but those who have\\, and loved the first game\\, should consider that they may be taking a suck because people die instead of always magically surviving in a horrible harsh world\\, or just intolerant\\, sexist\\, and\/or a keyboard warrior. The little details in this game make it great. They took some big risks in having you play a character who is a somewhat masculine woman. Good on Naughty Dog for challenging society norms. Things like armpit stubble on one of the female characters (who would actually be shaving regularly in this world?). One argument people use is \\\"the game is too violent\\\". Again\\, that is valid if you didn't play or like the first one. If you did\\, that's a horrible argument\\, it's very similar to the first game\\, where Joel murders tons of people\\, including innocent firefly's and essentially dooms the world for one girl. He just committed a planet to doom! I loved Joel but that is about the worst crime you could commit! The revenge against him was valid\\, but the cycle continued until both Abby and Ellie ended it. I will admit\\, there are times I did not like playing Abby. She is my enemy of course ! But you play on knowing there is a reason.Just finished the game last night\\, and it was good\\, satisfying\\, and makes you think\\, just like the first game. Leaves the door open for more. Hope they do a part 3 once the keyboard warriors simmer down. They could wrap it up with a mission to find someone who could carry on the firefly work and make a cure\\, perhaps work it in that Abby's survival leads to finding this person\\, and cure due to Ellie's act of mercy (returning the favor from Abby).I gave the first game 10\/10\\, I give this one 9\/10. I did miss Joel too\\, but as the game goes on\\, you realize he deserved what he got. If you put yourself in Abby's shoes\\, Ellie would have done the same thing as her!Slam dunk for Naughty Dog!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
