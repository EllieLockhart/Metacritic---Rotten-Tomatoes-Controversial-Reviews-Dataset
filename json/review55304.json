Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Let the past die. Kill it if you have to.\\\" This is a central theme for SW:TLJ\\, and one that old fans (meaning you grew up watching dubbed VHS tapes of the OG trilogy until they wore thin) may not be able to embrace. The themes of learning and moving on from past mistakes and failures\\, and also letting go of everything you know in order to forge ahead\\, not only applied to the lead characters in the movie\\, but also to the diehard SW fans who clutch so tightly to everything that made the OG trilogy sacred.\\n\\nThis SW is not perfect and there are some flaws - from the odd pacing (it tended to drag but also feel too fast at the same time)\\, to the bloated run time\\, to the extraneous characters and subplots. However\\, I do feel this movie is a turning point for this trilogy much in the same way that ESB was for the OG trilogy. \\n\\nI don't think Rian Johnson was going to be able to satisfy everyone with this story. Either you wanted him to stick with the \\\"traditional\\\" SW stuff that made the originals so great\\, or you wanted him to do something completely fresh and new. He chose mostly the latter\\, and ended up making a very divisive SW film. I think we'll need time to digest and analyze this\\, as well as watch it again after Episode IX to see how it truly sits in SW canon.\\n\\nI think we can confidently say that SW:TLJ gives us one of the most deeply nuanced and complex villains in any big budget movie franchise in recent memory. It also gives us a very diverse universe full of humans of all galactic ethnicities. Finally\\, I feel that it gives us a film where you actually get some understanding of the context of how war (whether Rebel vs Empire or Resistance vs First Order) impacts all citizens of the SW universe from varying socioeconomic backgrounds. In some ways\\, this may be the most political SW movie to date\\, not counting the lame senate debates of the prequel trilogy!\\n\\nI'm excited to see where they take the story next honestly.","true":true}
