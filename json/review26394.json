Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not what I would expect from a movie with a 93% critics score. Perhaps everyone was afraid of offending the memory of Carrie Fisher. The actual movie plot was underwhelming and a little scattered. There was so much potential built up in The force awakens but that all fell flat like a popped balloon in this movie ","true":true}
