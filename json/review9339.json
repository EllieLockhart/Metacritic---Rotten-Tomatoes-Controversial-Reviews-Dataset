Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Genuinely one of the best Star Wars films there has ever been. Rian Johnson takes risks and changes what we thought we knew about the force from the previous films. The film as a standalone is full of action\\, drama\\, suspense and is thouroughly entertaining. It pays homage to previous films and characters really well and at times has that comedy and charm of the franchise as a whole. Taking the story forward by changing things makes the next instalments unpredictable; which is a risk but one that is sure to pay off. Rey and Kylo are now fully fledged Star Wars characters that we're either rooting for or against. Finn and Poe's position is clarified and I cannot wait to see these characters develop even more as we reach this story's climax.","true":true}
