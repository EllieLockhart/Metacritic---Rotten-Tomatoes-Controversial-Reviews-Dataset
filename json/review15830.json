Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love star wars saga since I was a child. This picture is incredible\\, is a master piece for me and the best picture of the saga too. A lot of  incredible moments\\, action moments\\, surprises\\, the best visual effects that I\u00b4ve even seen and all the film are connected with all the pictures of the saga with magestry. Is a master piece","true":true}
