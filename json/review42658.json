Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was easily and by far the worst of all Star Wars movies. I am so disappointed in this franchise.... The Games are better than the movies at this rate. I could predict EVERYTHING that was going to happen and the actors and characters are basically just annoying and childlike. There is no grit in this movie\\, there is no good acting\\, there is no follow up to random things that happen\\, no explanations\\, nothing. This movie was pointless and is basically just people running around like headless chickens for many hours and getting nothing done..... Honestly\\, don't pay for this movie if you're expecting anything impressive. The writer of this movie had no idea what they were doing; I nearly walked out of the theater. Nuff said.","true":true}
