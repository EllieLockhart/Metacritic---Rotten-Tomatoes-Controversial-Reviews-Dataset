Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This has the superficial appearance of a Star Wars film but lacks any plot\\, character growth\\, tension and has annoying characters that do things that do not make any sense. Sadly this film should have been much better give the wealth of source material and the legion of fans who care about the series. It succeeds in cutting itself off from the Star Wars that we know. Why it's called episode 8 is beyond me. I guess the plan is now to have an endless pararade of films called Star Wars for the sake of making money and trying to be politically correct. The professional critics who rate so highly this film should be ashamed.","true":true}
