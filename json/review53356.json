Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite the lack of positive reviews from fans\\, I enjoyed this movie. Although some scenes can be cheesy and cause a little cringe like the opening scene\\, the scenes with Kylo Ren and Supreme Leader Snoke are some of the best of the franchise. I agree with the criticism of Luke but I was glad to see he was redeemed. The lack of Captain Phasma also is one of my main problems with the movie. Overall I had a fun time and loved some of the scenes with Kylo Ren\\, Snoke\\, and Rey.","true":true}
