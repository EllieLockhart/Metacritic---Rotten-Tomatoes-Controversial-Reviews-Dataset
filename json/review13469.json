Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I expected to hate Last Jedi\\, but I loved it. The characters were true to how I knew them and unlike the other middle trilogy movies the plot was satisfying in its own right. The action was exciting and there were quite a few one liners that kept it funny.","true":true}
