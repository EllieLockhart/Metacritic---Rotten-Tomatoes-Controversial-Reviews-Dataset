Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you are a literalist\\, the genre is not for you. Same if you have harped on fan theories. Let the movie unfold. It is a rich and entertaining film as much about the issues of the day as in a galaxy far\\, far away. Rian Johnson and his story consultants at Lucasfilm reach deep and find meaning intertwined with humour and action. As a first generation Star Wars fan I have appreciated the Disney era and its respect for the tone of the Original Trilogy as well as its potential for a rich underbelly\\, especially in this period where the First Order (of business) reigns indeed. If a stronger resistance is inspired\\, so much the better.","true":true}
