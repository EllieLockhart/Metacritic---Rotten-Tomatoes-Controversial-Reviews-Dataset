Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force Awakens was good and the build up was good for this movie\\, yet Snoke was basically nerfed into a sock puppet and easily beaten.\\n\\nCould go on as to how bad it was\\, not going to see the next \\\"Star Wars\\\" movie.
