Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sure it has some weak spots. But it's also engaging\\, thrilling\\, thought-provoking\\, canon-building\\, and worthy of watching time and time again. I think this movie will stand up to the test of time like the best. I plan to see it at least 2 more time in theaters before the run is done and to buy it as soon as it is released on DVD. It challenges our understanding of the characters in a new\\, excellent way.","true":true}
