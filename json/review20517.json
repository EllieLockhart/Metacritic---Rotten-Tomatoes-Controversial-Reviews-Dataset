Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been watching and rewatching starwars films my whole life. it's a movie series that got me into movies. if you are like me\\, please do not watch this film. I know you will watch it anyway but don't say I didn't worn you. The narrative in this film is a disgrace to the original trilogy. it seemed as though the script was written by someone who loosely research star wars but never actually watch one. this film's only redeeming qualities are it's musical score\\, action\\, and visuals. Star Wars Fans want more than just that.","true":true}
