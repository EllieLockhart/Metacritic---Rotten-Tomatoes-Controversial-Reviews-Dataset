Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't understand where these negative views are coming from. I am a huge Star Wars fan\\, and I absolutely loved this movie. It was not predictable in any way\\, and i kept me guessing until the very end.\\n\\nI watched The Force Awakens in theaters\\, and I hated it. It was cheesy and redundant\\, and you knew what would happen well before it did. I felt it was like a bad fan fiction come to life. While all the acting and special effects were great\\, the story itself was lame.\\n\\nThis movie somehow pays great homage to Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi without ever being either of them. The events were all new and surprising\\, and yet I still thought\\, \\\"Hey\\, that reminds me of that other scene.\\\" It was a great tribute and much improved from its predecessor. \\n\\nThe acting is all superb in the film. Mark Hamill is incredible as Luke\\, bringing a strength and maturity to the character that it lacked in the original trilogy. Kylo is annoying\\, but it's Kylo\\, so.","true":true}
