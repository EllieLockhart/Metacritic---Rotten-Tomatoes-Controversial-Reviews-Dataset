Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*DON'T LISTEN TO THE OTHER AUDIENCE REVIEWS* This movie is unique and separates itself from the other movies in the franchise. The audience is not rating this movie on how it was put together and the  cinematography that's in this movie. They are rating it on what happens to the characters and what background information was revealed about them. Part of a movies story is what happens to the character and just because something happens to a character that you don't like does not mean the movie is bad. The Last Jedi is a fun\\, action packed movie that will have you on your seat the entire movie! Rian Johnson has truly made a unique Star Wars film and the audience can not appreciate it. Listen the critics reviews not the audience\\, critics actually rate the movie on how its put together and the cinematography \\, the audience will rate it on how they thought the movie should have played out.","true":true}
