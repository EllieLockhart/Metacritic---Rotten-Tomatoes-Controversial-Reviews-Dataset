Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"no character development\\, unanswered plot holes that they created in the last movie\\, mistreatment of the Iconic characters and the past movies themselves. To many political agendas and I could go for hours. Casino scene\/ Kanto Bite scene is just an insult.","true":true}
