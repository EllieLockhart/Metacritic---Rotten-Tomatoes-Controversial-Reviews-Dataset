Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"came out slightly disappointed\\,it probably gets another star through sympathy to the saga. reasonable start \\, very poor middle and ok end. cringe worthy in places \\, some dreadful acting and some of the attempts at comedy awful. some quite bizarre moments as well with milk \\, iron etc and those penguins \u00f0??\u00a9...
