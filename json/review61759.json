I'm just quite speechless.\r\rLet me tell you what my experience consisted of:\r\rInitially when they introduced Joel again talking to Tommy: This is awesome! I'm right at home again!\r\rWhen they forced me to play a character I didn't have any desire to play: Why do I have to play her\\, I hope it's not for long.\r\rThe entire spot that kicks off the game: This sucks but I'm sure it'll make it a better story.\r\rThe Entirety of Seattle: THIS IS AWESOME\r\rThe second half of the game: This is terrible\\, just 10 more hours of it? That sounds like a grind so I'm just going to look up the ending.\r\rMy time on YouTube: This ending is terrible.\r\rMy opinion on this game is to steer clear\\, the gameplay is good but they'll get you invested just to pull you away right at the climax of the story and force you to do stuff that really just takes you out of the experience and immersion to the point that you just google how it ends to get it over with.\r\rThis is such a stain on the franchise\\, a real damn shame as it was my very favorite franchise ever.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
