Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Tried to give the movie another chance by seeing it a second time last night. Liked it even less this time around unfortunately. While it has a few enjoyable moments\\, they are so overshadowed by the outright bad parts that it was difficult to get through. Definitely will not ne picking this up on blu-ray.","true":true}
