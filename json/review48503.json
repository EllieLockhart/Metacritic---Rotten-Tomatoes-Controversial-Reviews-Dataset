Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Women are superior. Colored people are superior. Animals deserve to be saved from slavery and cruelty. Children do not. The enemy is fascist and of course is white and male and stupid. The force is not something that needs training. If you are a woman\\, this is granted and comes for free\\, even if you are the child of drunkards\\, even if you are a fatty insignificant poor janitor. For your information\\, this is called a Pussy-pass. Wealth is bad\\, except for Kathleen Kennedy\\, Rian Johnson and the other millionaires who produced this mess who\\, by the way\\, could easily be found among the gamblers at Canto Bight. Disney lured lots of people into the theathers with a mix of deceptive trailers and paid critics\\, but this trick can only be done once. The next installments of Disney Star Wars will fail at the box office. WE ARE NOT STUPID AS YOU MAY THINK\\, DISNEY\\, AND YOU WILL PAY FOR THINKING SO. Also\\, please stop paying shills to glorify this immense pile of shit that is The Last Jedi.","true":true}
