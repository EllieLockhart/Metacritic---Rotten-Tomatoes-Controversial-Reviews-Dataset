Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lost opportunity and story mess.  To much focus or screen time on new characters instead of Rey\\, Finn and Kilo.  The defeat of Snoke was just too easy.  No good backstory to explain Rey's sudden incredible skill with the force and it just broke the believability of this fantasy.  No redemption of Phasma by Finn to show his increasingly honorable character (\\\" I see the 'good' in her\\\" ).  An Illogical race across space breaking in like a second mini-movie just to try and save everyone with no satisfaction or final reason.  Unnecessary surprises that seemed to exist for no other reason than to just trick the audience. Sudden saviors filling in how they got out of predicaments.   The whole story has so many plot holes that it has made the next movie difficult\\, hopefully\\, JJ can salvage it or perhaps they need to call George back in.  Overall the whole movie was more like a muddled fast-moving space soap opera\\, but with lots of awesome special effects thrown in to distract us.  None the less\\, I would say it was at least as enjoyable as the first three episodes of Starwars and worth watching to stay with the story even if nothing more than to critique on how not to make a star wars movie.","true":true}
