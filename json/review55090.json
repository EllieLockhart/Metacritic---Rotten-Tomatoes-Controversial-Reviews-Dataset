Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to like this movie\\, I really did\\, and while it's not the worst film ever made\\, it's also not the best. It left me dissapointed and scared for my favorite franchise. Once the excitement of watching a Star Wars movie wears off\\, it becomes apparent that this movie is average at best: the fight scenes\\, the visuals\\, the music\\, the story going on in the background and some beautiful and sweet moments in the film were not enough to make this movie the best it could be. It could be compared to the prequel trilogy but if I'm being honest\\, this movie is worse than that because while the prequels have some sort of nostalgia feel to them and can be considered fun-bad\\, this movie is more like evil-bad. It reeks of Marvel-type movies in the worst way possible and doesn't feel like Star Wars. I'm really dissapointed that this movie is the way it is and that Rian Johnson gets to have three of his own Star Wars movies when the Last Jedi is full of plot holes\\, \\\"risks\\\" for the sake of taking risks\\, cheesy jokes\\, weird pacing and transitions between scenes and more. I cannot understand why the critics are praising it. \\nThe out of character characterization; weird format of the movie; not very surprising twists; unnecessary nudity that I promise you nobody asked for; lack of plot development in favor of unnecessary characterization that was already astablished in The Force Awakens; cheap jokes many of which seem to be delivered by\/directed at the characters of color as if the only purpose of those characters is to be the comic relief of the movie; continued and unnecessary displays of violence towards characters of color and the sidelining of said characters in favor of unnecessary soap opera that ends up not mattering in the end... this is not what Star Wars should be about\\, especially not in 2017. This movie seems unnecessary and filler-like\\, it doesn't answer questions but forces us to ask the old ones all over again. It leaves a lot to interpretation and development in the next film and seems more of some fan's fantasy that came true rather than what the second movie in the trilogy should be.","true":true}
