Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am so disappointed in the Star Wars franchise to the point that the Marvel Universe is much more interesting. Much has already been said about the choices made by Disney regarding plot\\, lackluster acting\\, and absurd jokes. These movies are just a retelling of the same story contained in the first six movies.","true":true}
