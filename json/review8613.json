Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First time I watched this movie\\, I really felt I didn\u2019t like it. However\\, I watched it again and really enjoyed and liked it a lot better. I believe it is a great movie!","true":true}
