Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A post-modernist pile of bantha poodoo\\, which systematically deconstructs all elements of Star-Wars symbols and motifs\\, while trying very hard to subvert your expectations\\, by seemingly pulling plot twists straight from Edgar Walla's Plot Wheel.\\n\\nI would not recommend this movie to anyone who values good storytelling and a coherent plot.\\n\\nIf you are not able to shut down your brain for the whole duration of the movie\\, I would not recommend it.\\n\\nAdding one star for nice looking imagery and decent musical score.","true":true}
