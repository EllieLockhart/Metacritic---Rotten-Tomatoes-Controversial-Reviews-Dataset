Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I do not have time or desire to list the countless problems I have with this movie.  Easily the worst Star Wars movie ever\\, if you can call it a Star Wars movie?  It felt as though with each passing scene my dismay only grew stronger.  After an epic return to the big screen with The Force Awakens\\, I just don't know how anyone who saw this final cut\\, agreed to let it represent this epic franchise?  All the tension\\, drama and questions generated from Ep 7 were passed by the way side to bring us birds with big eyes and no purpose and crystal foxes that know the way out of a place with no other way out!  What might be even worse is\\, I don't know how the recover from here?  They genuinely ruined the story (if this one had a story) and took almost all characters past the point of no return in their development.  The only Solution is a re-release of Ep 8 which reveals\\, the whole Last Jedi was a nightmare Luke or Rey had on that island!","true":true}
