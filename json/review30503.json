Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Shockingly bad.  A collage of rip offs from Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.  No strong male characters\\, political (liberal) undertones made the movie annoying to watch.  Ridiculous plot lines throughout the film as well as pointless subplots also didn't help.  A slew of unanswered questions also plague the film.  One disappointment after another.  All in alll\\, the movie was written and shot as if it was in a cartoon world.  Silly\\, stupid\\, ridiculous\\, annoying\\, boring\\, insulting and in general\\, awful.  It never occurred to me when I bought my ticket that it would be an awful movie.  Star Wars has gone to the dark side.","true":true}
