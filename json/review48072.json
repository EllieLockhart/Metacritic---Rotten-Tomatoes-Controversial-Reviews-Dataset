Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the cinematography was amazing\\, and some interesting scenes were sprinkled in\\, this movie tries too hard to subvert expectations and rips apart previous Star Wars canon in the process. While the overall film is mediocre\\, this is simply not good in the context of the Star Wars franchise.","true":true}
