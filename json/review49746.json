Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"wtf Rian Johnson. It takes skill to make a Star Wars movie that bad. The story was the biggest waste of time\\, you ruined Luke Skywalker's character\\, the comedy made it seem like an avengers film (and the comedy was pretty bad)\\, the action was terrible\\, and most of the characters were bad as well. Why was Rose Tico there? And you killed off Admiral Ackbar without so much of a second thought and replaced him with some purple-haired lady who no one cared about. Nice","true":true}
