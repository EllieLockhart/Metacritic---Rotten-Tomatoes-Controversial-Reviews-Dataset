Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a Star Wars fan since I was born. I feel like while most people have a few solid points of bad parts in this film that they are just looking for things to make the movie bad. In my opinion the movie was great it does not go the way you think. The amount of good things in this film outway the bad. For anyone saying this was another phantom menace you are insane. This film was so much better than that. Rian did something that no one has done with a Star Wars film and people either love it or hate it.","true":true}
