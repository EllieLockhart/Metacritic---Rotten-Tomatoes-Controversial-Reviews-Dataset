{"101487":192382,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-02-03","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very long and in depth review commentary about every aspect of this movie - you've been warned.\\n\\nWhat an absolute trainwreck of a movie. I don't even know where to begin. I've tried approaching this review several different ways\\, but I have so much to say that it feels like I'm writing a novel. This movie is a perfect example of poor writing and should be used in all scriptwriting classes to teach aspiring screenwriters what to avoid doing.\\n\\nLike I did with my review of The Force Awakens where I compared it to A New Hope\\, I think I'll start my review of The Last Jedi by comparing it to The Empire Strikes Back: \\n\\nThe Resistance (Rebel Alliance) is evacuating their base on D'Qar (Hoth) when the First Order (Empire) shows up. The First Order (Empire) pursues Leia (Leia) through outer space for a good chunk of the movie. Rey (Luke Skywalker) travels to a far away planet to find Luke Skywalker (Yoda)\\, a Jedi Master who's lived in hiding for many years. Luke (Yoda) is skeptical to train Rey (Luke) at first\\, but eventually agrees to teach her (him) some lessons. Rey (Luke) wanders into a Dark Side cave and has a weird vision\/hallucination. Rey (Luke) leaves before her training is complete to help her friends and confront Kylo Ren (Darth Vader). After an intense lightsaber battle (although not against each other)\\, the experienced Dark Side Force user\\, Kylo Ren (Darth Vader)\\, sticks out his hand towards the novice Light Side Force user\\, Rey (Luke)\\, and asks her to join him. Luke (Luke) shows up at the end of the movie to try to save Leia (Leia) from the clutches of the First Order (Empire) and she escapes on the Millennium Falcon (Millennium Falcon). Although it doesn't happen at the beginning of the movie\\, there's also a cheap knockoff of the Battle of Hoth with trenches\\, laser batteries\\, walkers\\, speeders and a white substance that covers the ground (\\\"Salt.\\\"). And it wouldn't be a complete ripoff without the \\\"Dark Side tyrant leading a faceless war machine with a Dark Side apprentice who has a special connection with a Light Side newbie\\\" paradigm. There's even a little Return of the Jedi in it because Snoke (Palpatine) tortures Rey (Luke) in front of Kylo Ren (Darth Vader) and then Ren (Vader) kills his master Snoke (Palpatine). They should just call this trilogy a remake of the original\\, because it's just a slightly different (albeit worse) version of what's already happened. \\n\\nThis new trilogy lacks originality and sense. They don't seem to want to consult George Lucas\\, but they have no qualms with stealing his ideas and making them worse. And they definitely believe bigger is better. They take the AT-AT\\, Super Star Destroyer and Death Star (which were already big) and make them bigger with the AT-M6\\, Dreadnought\/Supremacy and Starkiller Base. So original. Then there's the conflicted Dark Side Force user who has Skywalker blood and the powerful Light Side Force user from a backwater\\, desert planet. The Rebels defeated the Empire over 30 years ago and established the New Republic. How did they let the First Order get so powerful and not see that being a problem? Was the New Republic just 5 planets that were unrealistically close to each other and its entire fleet was just in orbit around them so the whole New Republic got entirely wiped out by Starkiller Base in one shot? That's convenient. So now the Resistance has to start a \\\"rebellion\\\" against this Empire knockoff? Does Leia at any point think to herself\\, \\\"Hey. Didn't I already do this 30 years ago?\\\" This trilogy basically renders everything that happened in the original trilogy meaningless and just tries to do it over (and I don't really blame them because it was great...the first time around). Is there really no other threat or conflict in the whole Star Wars galaxy that doesn't involve a powerful dictatorship versus a small band of freedom fighters? There's 40 years worth of books and comics they could check out since they clearly have no problem stealing ideas! How about stealing ideas that WEREN'T ALREADY MOVIES? How much do you want to bet Rian Johnson's new trilogy involves an outmatched group of rebels trying to overthrow a ruthless tyrant? It's just the same cycle over and over again. And there are too many \\\"conveniences\\\" in TLJ where pointless or absurd actions or chains of events conveniently work out. What in Johnson' limited resume gave Disney the impression that he could handle making this movie? The only thing I remember from Brothers Bloom was one of the characters died and Looper was disappointing (and I've never even heard of Brick). What did they see in this film that could possibly convince them to award him his own trilogy? Based on their track record\\, I think Disney didn't actually care if Johnson's writing was good or bad\\, they were just happy he fit SJW moments and characters into a Star Wars script. This trilogy's story structure is so out of whack it feels like TLJ is either the end of a trilogy or maybe the first part. Worst of all\\, it doesn't feel like Star Wars. It just feels like some weird\\, inferior\\, alternate universe. TLJ is easily the worst Star Wars movie ever made and one of the most poorly written movies I've ever seen. For me\\, the Star Wars timeline ends at Return of the Jedi. \\n\\nThose were my general thoughts on the film. The rest is the detailed criticisms. So either turn away now or strap yourself in. \\n\\nIt's hard to judge the logic of the film\\, because it didn't feel like there was any in it. I'm sure most movies have some degree of plot holes or logic gaps when you analyse it close enough. But The Last Jedi had me throwing up my hands in objection several times as the logic gaps were so blatantly obvious.\\n\\nAt the beginning of the movie\\, Poe destroys all the cannons on the First Order's Dreadnought making it possible for an attack run on it by the Resistance's painfully slow bombers. These bombers are so impractically slow that I can't imagine they would be used in any circumstance other than bombing things that are defenseless and stationary like a shed. One of the four remaining bombers got destroyed after arming its bombs and somehow ended up blowing up two other bombers\\, because they fly stupidly close to each other. \\n\\nThe gunner of the last bomber climbs the ladder up to the main deck where the remote control for arming and releasing the bombs (which is just the same button\\, so how do you disarm them?...) is located and she tries to release the bombs\\, but the ship gets hit by enemy fire. So she falls down the ladder (because of the gravity in a bomber in space...) and lands on a platform that saves her from falling to her death (although I'm not sure how she's able to breathe and isn't blown out into the vacuum of space since she was next to the bay doors right as they opened...). She kicks the ladder repeatedly trying to force the teetering remote control to fall down to her. After about a million kicks\\, she grabs the medallion around her neck that gives her extreme kicking power and the remote finally falls. But she doesn't try to catch it...She watches the remote fall past her in slow motion to build suspense and then she remembers she has hands and reaches under the platform to grab it. \\n\\nMost of the 2 and a half hours of the movie felt like the First Order was chasing the pitiful Resistance fleet through empty space. Thrilling\\, right? It's like watching a sloth chase a turtle. The Resistance fleet is almost out of fuel and can't jump to lightspeed because the First Order designed supposedly impossible technology to track ships through hyperspace. Since the Resistance ships are lighter and faster than the First Order's fleet\\, they decide to just fly at full speed knowing the First Order can't overtake them. It's a brilliant idea considering no one in the First Order is smart enough to jump to lightspeed in front the Resistance to box them in. So instead\\, the First Order follows them for 6 hours until their fuel runs out...It reminds of the time Homer Simpson was chained to a tree and was being chased around it by a cop and the cop asked Chief Wiggum for help\\, so Wiggum sent Lou in and Lou chased Homer from the same direction as the first cop instead of going the other way around to corner him (for comedic effect\\, obviously). At least Lou had the sense to ask Wiggum to call for more backup...\\n\\nBut back to the tracking device\\, Finn and the new character Rose Tico (who felt more like an annoying activist after taking one semester at almost any university than resistance fighter and had a few lame speech moments) somehow conclude that the tracking device is only active on the lead ship so they need to sneak aboard and shut it off so their fleet can escape into hyperspace without being tracked because if they simply destroyed Supremacy then another Star Destroyer would just start tracking them. Why all the Star Destroyers aren't tracking the fleet to prevent a situation like that isn't explained. Maybe they're trying to cut costs on their energy bill. And how Supremacy tracked the Resistance fleet in hyperspace when it wasn't even at D'Qar when the Resistance fled or why Snoke doesn't know he has that tracking technology on his ship\\, let alone that it even exists\\, aren't explained either. But I digress. The real question is why doesn't the Resistance abandon the flagship\\, board the other ships and all jump into hyperspace in different directions? Assuming the tracking device only tracks one ship at a time and since the First Order is only using one tracker at a time because they're energy conscience\\, they're likely only tracking the would-be abandoned flagship and would follow it until it ran out of fuel. Rose wants to know how they can find the dedicated power breaker to turn off the tracker on the Star Destroyer and Finn says\\, \\\"The guy who used to mop it\\,\\\" implying he could do it. He said he was sanitation on Starkiller Base in The Force Awakens. This guy's mop and bucket sure got him around...Then in the very next scene when they're explaining their plan to Poe (but really to the audience)\\, Rose shows him a detailed hologram of Supremacy that SHOWS EXACTLY WHERE THE POWER BREAKER IS LOCATED...Guess they don't need mop boy anymore...\\n\\nThroughout the whole slog through space\\, Supremacy bombards the Resistance's flagship\\, but apparently the distance is too far to be effective. But if the Resistance ships are faster than the First Order's\\, then shouldn't they gradually get further and further away from the First Order to the point where they're completely out of cannon range (especially after 18 hours of chase!)? Even when they abandon ship for smaller transports\\, they're still in cannon range of the ridiculously accurate Supremacy. Ever hear of evasive maneuvers? \\n\\nAnd after deciding to abandon the flagship\\, the lavender-haired Admiral Holdo (who was terrible and also has a lame speech) says someone needs to stay behind to pilot the cruiser for the others to escape and volunteers to go down with the ship. So she needs to stay behind to fly straight? With all that advanced technology\\, they don't have auto-pilot? Sure lucky she did stay behind\\, because once Supremacy started to pick off the transports way too easily\\, Holdo turned the ship around and jumped into lightspeed at Snoke's ship splitting it in half. Pretty convenient she stayed behind unnecessarily like that. \\n\\nAlthough it feels like more time has passed\\, the story would suggest that \\nThe Force Awakens and The Last Jedi take place over the course of a few days. So in that time\\, Rey discovers she's Force sensitive and is already the equal in skill and mastery of the Force as Kylo Ren and Luke Skywalker? She doesn't need to even train or try something once and she can already do it just as well or better than Kylo Ren (that's more of a carry over complaint from TFA). And I don't know how long the days are on Ahch-To\\, but Rey arrived in the evening and left the FOLLOWING night. So the two nights she was there took less time than the First Order chasing the Resistance from D'Qar to Crait which was at most 18 hours. Although shorter days are possible\\, it shouldn't be left up to the audience to assume that (even though it was more likely\\, surprise\\, surprise\\, a lapse in logic) especially since we're accustomed to 24 hour days.\\n\\nThere's a scene late in the movie where the Resistance hunkers down in an old Rebel base. As the base doors are closing\\, a whole bunch of crystal critters scurry into the protection of the base. Why? Who cares. Rian doesn't explain much up to this point\\, so why would he start now? The critters would've been safer running in ANY OTHER DIRECTION than the base. They serve no purpose except to be an extremely convenient reason for the Resistance fighters to find a way out of the base. Luke's Force projection appears and distracts Kylo Ren and the First Order. While he's outside dueling Ren\\, Poe comes to the brilliant deduction that Luke's doing it for a reason. He's stalling them to give the Resistance a chance to escape. Why\\, you ask\\, didn't Luke just tell them he's going to stall the First Order so they can escape? Because that would make sense. So when they notice the crystal critters are gone\\, they conveniently spot one that appears to be intentionally waiting around for them to see it. All it was missing was a sign saying - THIS WAY! \\n\\nThe First Order deploys their \\\"laser battering ram\\\" about 50 miles away from the base that has to be dragged there under protection of AT-M6s and AT-ATs. The Resistance uses these crappy old speeders to attack the First Order. The problem is they never attack anything. They're cannon fodder. Poe says\\, \\\"We have to hold them until they blow up that cannon!\\\" Who are \\\"they\\\"? No one tries to blow up the cannon outside of Finn attempting a suicide run with his speeder. It's like they had no plan at all. Which seems appropriate based on the writing up to this point in the movie. And when did Finn learn to fly? In The Force Awakens\\, he specifically helped Poe escape First Order custody because he needed a pilot. And since he started this movie in the medbay that he was in at the end of TFA\\, I don't think he had any time to squeeze in a few lessons. \\n\\nFinn's attempted suicide run is ruined by Rose who crashes her speeder into his (which looked like it should've killed them both anyway). Finn runs over to see if she's okay and he drags her back to base. There are two problems with it. One\\, they crashed right in front of the group of First Order walkers. So not one walker even tried to take a potshot at them? The other is he dragged her all way the back to the base in relatively the same amount of time it took the speeders to get that far out and managed to get past the skirmish between Luke's Force projection and the First Order right in front of the base unscathed? \\n\\nAll that falls under the wide umbrella of bad writing and so does dialogue. There are a couple moments where it felt like Rian Johnson was speaking directly to the audience\\, because the dialogue served no purpose otherwise.\\n\\nRight at the beginning of the film when the First Order arrives at D'Qar during the Resistance's evacuation\\, General Hux needlessly gloats to another officer that he has orders from \\\"Snoke himself\\\" to fire on and destroy the Resistance or something. Well\\, of course the orders came from Snoke. Who else would they come from? As far as the audience is aware\\, the chain of command goes Snoke and then General Hux. There's no one else in between to give him orders. So Hux is basically reminding the audience that Snoke is the leader or something in case we forgot in the last two years between films. \\n\\nDuring the Resistance's last stand\\, a whole bunch of soldiers are in a trench ready for battle with the First Order's approaching AT-M6s and AT-ATs. One soldier touches the white ground around him and tastes it saying\\, \\\"Salt.\\\" Before you ask\\, no\\, salt did not play a part in saving the day or furthering the plot. I can only conclude Rian thought with the trenches\\, laser batteries\\, large walkers\\, speeders\\, a rebel base and white ground\\, that the scene felt a little too \\\"Hothy\\\". So in case the audience was thinking that too\\, he made sure to point out that the white stuff was SALT\\, not snow. Thanks for clearing that up\\, Rian! He could've avoided that entirely by not ripping off The Empire Strikes Back. But since all this new trilogy does is rip off the original trilogy\\, thinking creatively was not an option. Even making the ground ANY COLOUR BUT WHITE would've made the \\\"salt\\\" line unnecessary. \\n\\nThere's a scene where Rey is brought to Snoke and he's bragging that he can't be beaten because he sees Kylo's mind and every intent. (Surprise\\, surprise. He also treads on Emperor Palpatine's line about fulfilling destiny.) Snoke closes his eyes and says\\, \\\"I see him turning the lightsaber to strike true. And now...foolish child! He ignites it and kills his true enemy!\\\" While Snoke is saying this\\, Kylo is turning the saber in his hand while simultaneously using the Force to turn Rey's lightsaber that's on Snoke's arm rest towards him. Then he ignites Rey's lightsaber instead on his own\\, killing Snoke. The idea in itself wasn't bad as Snoke was right in what he saw\\, but he couldn't see the finer details. The problem is the dialogue was so awful. The ambiguity of \\\"his true enemy\\\" seemed conveniently forced and was odd phrasing just so it could stay open-ended. \\\"Ahhhh. You see what he did there? By saying it that way\\, he left it open so that Snoke could be his true enemy. Good thing he worded it like that.\\\" But it doesn't even feel true\\, because Snoke ended up being such a minor and disposable character. And Ren didn't turn to the Light Side and he struggled with Rey over Luke's lightsaber afterwards and still tried to destroy the Resistance. So Snoke wasn't his true enemy. He was just standing in the way of his ambition. The fact he either hated Luke so much or viewed him as such a threat that he ordered every First Order gun to fire on him when he walked out of the Rebel base would suggest to me that Luke was actually his true enemy. \\n\\nA couple times in the movie\\, Ren tells Rey to \\\"let the past die. Kill it\\, if you have to.\\\" It sounds like Rian is talking to the audience through Ren and telling us to just let go of everything we love about Star Wars\\, because he's going to kill it anyway. I get he wants to leave his own mark on the franchise or blaze his own trail\\, but does he have to trample and sully everything we cherish about it in the process?\\n\\nThere's also a lot of cheesiness and pointlessness in the film. \\n\\nRose and her sister each have interconnecting halves of a medallion. Throughout the film\\, they each touch it multiple times whenever something dramatic or emotional occurs to them or is about to happen. Rose's sister dies in the opening battle\\, so she had to grab hers twice in about a minute of screen time. Went to the well a little too much there.\\n\\nIn Disney's quest to kill off all our favorite characters from the original trilogy\\, a missile blew up the bridge of Leia's cruiser. She and Admiral Ackbar got blown into space where they both presumably died. Turns out it was just Ackbar who was unceremoniously dumped from the franchise as Leia has Force-space-phantom powers and flew herself back to the ship where apparently the corridors of the ship don't need to be pressurized as no one was blown out into space when she let herself in. Watching her fly was like watching a stage play where they put a hook on someone's belt and fly them around the stage with ropes and pulleys.\\n\\nFinn and Rose go on a forgettable\/regrettable side-quest to find a master code breaker at a casino. It felt like the whole purpose was more about social injustice commentary than furthering the plot. They get thrown in jail for parking on the beach and conveniently share a cell with a code breaker that agrees to help them for a price\\, but he later betrays them. And BB-8 somehow manages to subdue and tie up three guards on his own. Are we really supposed to believe he's designed to or even capable of accomplishing something like that? I mean\\, come on. During Finn and Rose's escape\\, they ride these abused-beasts that are used for races and go on a stampede through the city\\, tearing it up. It's...lame. The whole sequence on that planet seemed preachy and ended up being meaningless in the end. And the casino was filled with tiny and\/or weird-looking aliens doing weird things trying to be funny. Kinda reminds me of The Phantom Menace or the additional scenes in the special edition of A New Hope. Just things acting or looking silly trying to get a cheap laugh. And the master code breaker looked like that suave\\, greasy-haired\\, overly-charming\\, ladies man stereotype you'd see in soap operas or parodies. Finn and Rose were even told they'd recognise him by a certain flower on his lapel. I mean really\\, come on...\\n\\nYoda's Force ghost makes an appearance in the movie and it feels very out of place. They even used a puppet which was surprising in this day and age especially since they gave Snoke the unnecessary CGI treatment. It was a weird puppet though. His face looked squished for some of his scene. And I guess Force ghosts can control the elements and cause lightning strikes now. I'm sure they would've killed off Yoda too if he wasn't already dead. \\n\\nAfter Finn and Rose were captured during their failed attempt to deactivate the tracking device\\, they face Captain Phasma and a firing squad that is about to execute them. But suddenly an AT-ST opens fire on the stormtroopers. As the walker moves forward\\, the top of it is pulled off to reveal BB-8 operating it. So somehow a little\\, ball-droid managed to climb into the walker and operate the guns and legs. It didn't even look like there was a seat for a gunner to sit in. Then somehow Finn and Rose join BB-8 up where the cockpit used to be. Maybe they have Force-space-phantom powers too and flew up there. The shot of them on top of the walker \\nhopping along to a shuttle to escape was just wow...\\n\\nI mentioned earlier that Finn went to see Rose after she saved his life by crashing into his speeder. He asked why she stopped him and she said\\, \\\"I saved you. That's how we're going to win. Not by killing what we hate. But by saving what we love.\\\" So cheesy. (That would be a good time for that potshot I was talking about...) Inaccurate too. One could argue that in war\\, you save what you love BY killing what you hate (or the things trying to kill you and who you love). In fact\\, that's what Admiral Holdo did when she flew the cruiser into Supremacy. Then Rose kisses him and faints because Finn's such a stud. Or maybe because she's near death. Whatever the case\\, is she saying she fell in love with Finn after spending just 6 hours with him? We got a stage 5 clinger here! Then again\\, Finn's pretty clingy to Rey too for the short amount of time they've spent together...\\n\\nThis new trilogy doesn't have a great cast of characters and its villains are even worse. It is easily the worst collection of villains ever assembled. They just don't seem to know how to use them. I'd say the Fast & Furious villains are superior and I can't remember most of them. \\n\\nFirst\\, there's General Hux. He's a bombastic clown who gets turned into an abuse-monkey\\, punching bag. He talks like walking propaganda and doesn't exude any fear\\, competency or leadership. He's a joke. \\n\\nThen there's the painfully one-dimensional Captain Phasma. She's the most useless character in the whole Star Wars universe. I really didn't understand her presence in the films other than to be a lame nemesis for Finn and now she's dead (probably). All she did was walk around\\, awkwardly stiff\\, holding a blaster in the exact same position at all times. Can someone get her a holster or at least some WD-40 for her joints? What a waste of a potentially cool character.\\n\\nThe Not-So-Supreme Leader Snoke was another useless and underdeveloped character. So many questions remain about him\\, but it appears they're no longer important since he's dead (definitely). How did he get his hooks in Kylo Ren when he was being trained by Luke? Where did he come from? What happened to his face? Why does he look so stupid? Why did they use really bad CG when they could've used makeup since he's just an old human? Fortunately\\, Kylo Ren killed off this cheap copy of Emperor Palpatine so I won't have to look at him anymore.\\n\\nAdam Driver's performance as Kylo Ren was not bad for an emo\\, cry baby who can't control his emotions. It's mostly his look I have an issue with. He doesn't look intimidating. It would've been better for him to keep his mask on to cover his weak chin\\, but he destroyed it instead. And I also appreciate Kylo killing off Snoke\\, because he was terrible. \\n\\nRose and Holdo were awful (and had really bad hair)\\, I still don't really see Finn's purpose in all this\\, Rey is surprisingly unremarkable and forgettable (like her parents) and Poe is bored just looking for something to do. You could remove any character from these movies and they wouldn't be missed (and you probably wouldn't even notice). Seriously\\, you could take Rose\\, Finn\\, TJ\\, Maz\\, Poe\\, BB-8\\, Holdo\\, Snoke\\, Hux and Phasma out of TLJ and it would have little to no effect on the plot. Didn't really need Chewie all that much either (he was barely in it anyway).\\n\\nI guess the best character in TLJ was Luke\\, but that credit goes to George Lucas 40 years ago. He definitely wasn't the Luke I remember growing up. And even Mark Hamill said in an interview\\, \\\"I at one point had to say to Rian\\, 'I pretty much fundamentally disagree with every choice you've made for this character. Now\\, having said that\\, I have gotten it off my chest\\, and my job now is to take what you've created and do my best to realize your vision.' \\\" No! You resist! In that same interview\\, he said that reading the script for The Force Awakens\\, he thought his debut moment in the film was when his lightsaber was moving in the snow after Ren defeated Finn and was surprised that it flew into Rey's hand because she wasn't even trained. See?! Mark gets it! Luke appearing at that moment on Starkiller Base and Force-pulling his lightsaber would've been SO EPIC!!!!\\n\\nI'm not going to say a lot about the comedy. Some of it was okay. But there were ill-timed jokes to diffuse\/ruin dramatic moments\\, weird-looking aliens being weird for cheap laughs\\, slapstick bits for more cheap laughs and a surprising \\\"your mom\\\" joke. Luke was a little quippy and sarcastic. Not that it was necessarily bad\\, but it wasn't very Luke-like. There is one specific thing I will address though. Taking off where The Force Awakens ended\\, Rey is on Ahch-To presenting Luke's lightsaber to him. After some emotional facial acting and an epic score to play up the scene as momentous\\, Luke just chucks the lightsaber over his shoulder and storms past her. I found it a little funny at first\\, because it was so unexpected. But then as I thought about it and it felt spoofish. It ruined the tone and moment we've been hanging onto for 2 years. It was very poorly handled and not worth the cheap laugh. That's what I don't get this year in movies (especially Disney ones). Throw in as many jokes as possible even if it ruins the moment or movie. \\n\\nI can't in good conscience recommend this film to anyone. Whereas The Force Awakens was also a blatant ripoff of A New Hope and had logic gaps of its own\\, it was at least fun\\, funny and entertaining (all mostly because of Han) and well-paced. The same can't be said about The Last Jedi. It's illogical\\, nonsensical\\, cheesy and uninspired. This trilogy is a pale imitation of the original trilogy and grasping at straws with recycled themes\\, character archetypes and story. Rian Johnson will forever be known to me as the man who ruined Star Wars.","true":true}
