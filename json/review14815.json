Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have to say that I was very disappointed with episode 8. IT failed to deliver\\, I mean killing of Luke was not cool move. The new film series was supposed focus on the Skywalker family.. I am not surprised that many fans want it dropped from the franchise and remade.","true":true}
