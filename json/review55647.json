Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Now I know how heartbroken Obi Wan Kenobi felt when Anakin turned to the dark side.  My heart breaks for my childhood hero Luke Skywalker\\, in my heart this never happened because this simply isnt a star wars film. There is nothing left to save this film franchise which has never been able to recreate the spark in the universe that Star Wars gave generations of film goers from 1977.  \\n\\nIn the latest two films we know nothing more about the Star Wars universe.  The plot has never progressed and the two movies simply have borrowed a random order of events from the original trilogy and killed off characters we have loved.  there are characters we should love\\, hate and want to know more about but instead I'll summarise the plot as I saw it:\\n\\nThe rebels have been trapped in the middle of space by the first order until they run out of gas.  Rey gets trained by Luke Skywalker and confronts Kylo Ren.\\n\\nThe art of storytelling is over.  The immense star wars univers has never been so small and the plot holes have never been so big.\\n\\nI am off to reread Timothy Zahns Thrawn Trilogy books again which I still have from 1991.\\n\\nIf you think you are going to see Star Wars......    it's a TRAP!   \\n\\nRIP Admiral","true":true}
