Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was not Star Wars. It was Disney's way to make money  off of the Star Wars franchise. Rian Johnson's claim of being a Star Wars fan is an insult to anyone who actually is a StarWars fan. The way you protrayed Luke Skywalker is a complete and utter disgrace to everything Luke Skywalker is and what he stands for. I am so completely disgusted at what I watched. Thank ato you Rian Johnson you have not only ruined The Last Jedi but you have ruined The Force Awakens and the next movie that will be in this trilogy. I will NOT participate in anything you ever write or direct ever again. Disney should be ashamed to have their brand on this garbage","true":true}
