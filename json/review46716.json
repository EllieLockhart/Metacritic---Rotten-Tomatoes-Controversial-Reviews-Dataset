Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"We complain all the time about the fact that sagas cant reinvent themselves and the people that saw episode 1\\, 2 and 3 called them a cheap thrill filled with nothing of content. This definitely cannot be said about The Last Jedi.This movie managed what the prequels and episode 7 could not and that is gives us soemthing new and surprising and different. People will complain as they always do but something they cannot say is that the movie didnt take a risk. Also Leia's character was so well treated it breaks my heart even more we wont be able to see what journey she would have been taken","true":true}
