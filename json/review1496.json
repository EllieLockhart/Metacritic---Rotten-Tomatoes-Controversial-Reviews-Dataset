Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a huge Star Wars fan I couldn't help but feel empty after leaving the theater. I was disappointed and confused by the plot and feel a little bit angry that they screwed this up. I'm wondering why the critics gave it such rave reviews.","true":true}
