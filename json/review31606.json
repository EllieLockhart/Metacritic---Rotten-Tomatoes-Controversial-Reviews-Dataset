Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So much to think about and so much action. Have to see again after I digest. My favorite themes of the Force and what makes family was so wonderful...and seeing Carrie Fisher again was sad and awesome too.  Seeing it a year after she passed was very moving. We all clapped at the end credits when memorial came on the screen.","true":true}
