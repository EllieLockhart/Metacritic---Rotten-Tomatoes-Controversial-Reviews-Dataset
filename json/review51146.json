Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely horrible movie\\, where to start? Evidently every male character is an idiot and only women can save the galaxy LITERALLY! Why do this? A great thing about Star Wars has always been strong characters male and female. They went out of their way to make men look like idiots every single one. PLOT HOLES GALLORE\\, Luke leaves a map to find\\, only to tell the first person that finds him LEAVE ME ALONE! I want to DIE! What? And how about all those cloaked Klingon Ships\\, oops wrong franchise idiots! Yeah\\, and how about everyone with a military background (MEN again) having no clue what they are doing. Please sign a petition or something\\, this is was terrible from beginning to end.","true":true}
