Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars fans are always offended one way or another. Too much like the original trilogy they hate it\\, make a movie that can stand on its own and ignores every rumor out there they hate it. Quit living in the expanded universe\\, get over yourselves\\, and just enjoy the ride. I thought this movie was well done though not without it's flaws (Mary Poppins y'all). I loved how Rian Johnson would lead you to expect one thing then did another. I feel if he played into everyone's expectations it would have been predictable and a big disappointment. I left the theater feeling satisfied but not necessarily in a rush to go back and see it right away but it was worth the price of admission. ","true":true}
