Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Days prior to this movie\\, I rewatched all Star Wars\\, from ep1~6\\, and rewatched (liked 5 times) ep7 in 3D. I could recall the moment while watching ep7. I had tears rolling when i saw the Millennium Falcon. I had tears flowing when Hans Solo and Princess Leia appeared. I had the most chills when the man the whole movie is dedicated to find\\, finally appeared at the end of the movie. I remembered some article mentioned that Steven Spielberg loved it so much\\, that he watched 4 times. Guessed he's disgusted by the latest installment now. I clapped hands with the other viewers when the majestic theme started playing. But i did not clap when the movie ended. I will try not to give away the plot\\, if you must know\\, other reviewers (normal users please\\, not those so-called critiques) have already mentioned a little too much. I get it that they tried to tell as story full of unexpected plots and twists\\, however\\, make some sense please?? You can't just give us a twist without any good sense of doing it! I am not picky at all\\, as some users have written\\, such as Cap. Phasma not given enough depth. But I walked out after the end of the movie with a WTF feeling. Maybe Carrie Fisher wanted no more part in this rubbish\\, so she decided maybe its her time (God rest her soul) to bid farewell for good. (I will edit and remove this part of the content should any members condemn me for joking about the most-loved CF\\, no disrespecting intended at all). This is not a review to sway Star War fans or movie-goers away from this ep8. This is rather (i hope) a wake up call for the Disney executives to turn from the Dark Side towards the Light. Good or bad\\, i will still watch\\, as it is Star Wars. May the Force be with Disney!","true":true}
