Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie threw OT logic and lore into the fireplace in favor of appealing to children.  The main characters are as deep as the water in one's bathtub.  The 2 + hour movie served no purpose other than destroy the OT and milk a franchise already empty.  It does not move along the new trilogy or add to the original 6 movies.  One can skip over VIII and not miss a beat from VII to IX.  I can go on for days concerning almost every scene and \\\"plot\\\" issue\\, but I do not want to post  \\\"spoilers.\\\" However\\, I eill say the opening sequence makes zero sense with any of the knowledge of the Star Wars Universe and lore.","true":true}
