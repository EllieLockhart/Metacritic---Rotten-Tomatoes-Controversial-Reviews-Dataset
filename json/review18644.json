Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I took my family to see this movie on Christmas Eve. Overall it was terrible\\, I love Star Wars and was completely disappointed. Now that Luke actually has more than a cameo\\, I wish he didn't. He's turned into a bitter old man. The story was VERY loose and failed to grab any traction for at least the first hour of the film. \\n\\nThis film features several strong female characters which I embrace and applaud\\, however these characters are uninteresting because they lack any flaws. \\n\\nFin and Po\\, who showed such potential in The Force Awakens. were largely wasted in this film. Too bad.\\n\\nDaisy Ridley does a solid job as Rey she at least makes a mistake which is interesting.\\n\\nBy end of this film\\, they've killed half the cast with the exception of Princess Leia\\, and Carrie Fisher is the only one who has actually passed away. \\n\\nLeia is featured in a scene that defies explanation. If you've seen it\\, you know what I'm talking about. Dear Disney\\, if you want me to suspend by disbelief and enjoy a film you need to keep scenes that are so improbable\/impossible from jarring your audience back to reality. \\n\\nI agree with Variety's review. \\\"This is the least essential Star Wars film yet.\\\"","true":true}
