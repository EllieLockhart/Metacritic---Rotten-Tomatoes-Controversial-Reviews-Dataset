Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't think this was a particularly great movie because you had to have so much background (as SW fans usually do) in order to get the references and connections to earlier saga\\, but to me it was a very good Star Wars movie. I enjoyed watching Luke come to terms with his own guilt and fear\\, though I felt Rey's time on the island could have been shortened. And I enjoyed the ways they preserved Leia for the climactic moments. I will see it again and probably more than once.","true":true}
