Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie did it's job to entertain me and continued on the Star Wars universe quite well. Some of humor felt forced and misplaced. I look forward to watching the next installment of this franchise. I would see this movie again.","true":true}
