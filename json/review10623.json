Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"gutted - one word to sum up my feelings after watching the last Jedi.\\nAfter an exciting first 10 mins the film turns into a painfully slow chase film with a pointless mid break at a casino which serves no purpose than to give some characters screen time with no end result. We had characters who can fly in space\\, milking of space elephants\\, forced and pointless humour and the worst direction for one of cinemas most iconic characters. I wonder if the power of Disney has forced some reviewers hands as I cannot believe the positive reviews I've seen. Awful\\, truly awful. Worst SW film by a country mile.","true":true}
