Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Giving a single star for the good special effects.  The 'there was an attempt' star.  This is the worst star wars movie of all time.  ANd that in itself is an achievement disney\\, considering how bland 'the force awakens' or the problems that the 'phantom menace' had.  I will not being 'solo.'  you don't deserve a dime for the stain you have left on the legacy of the original trilogy.","true":true}
