Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst of the Star Wars films by a very wide margin.  Feels like a poorly written episode of Star Trek centered around the plot of a rebel fleet which is unable to outrun the First Order ships\\, which conveniently cannot catch up to but can bombard them at a certain length all because of 'lack of fuel'\\, in a Star Wars movie.  You heard correctly.  \\n\\nLuke Skywalker returns as a completely wasted and incorrectly written character who does things untrue to his last appearance in Return of The Jedi.  \\n\\nThe humor is horribly out of place throughout the entire movie\\, except for one moment involving a tree branch.  All other characters serve no development and have no compelling moments of their own\\, usually wasted on ridiculous sub plots or dead end narratives\\, wasting the viewers time and adding nothing to the movie itself.  \\n\\nThe Last Jedi felt as if it was written and directed by someone who despite the contrary\\, has never seen a Star Wars film in his life.  A truly monumental waste of time and disappointment.","true":true}
