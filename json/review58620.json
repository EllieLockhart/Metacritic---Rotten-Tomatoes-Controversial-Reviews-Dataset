One of the most polished games I've ever played. Amazing graphics\\, animation and voice acting. Just like the first game it will make you feel tension and emotions.

Don't listen to the haters unless you don't enjoy a dark story or need your heros and villains to be clearly defined black and white. Naughty Dog made another great game definitely a GOTY contender.
