Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Embarrassing and shameless exploitation of a once-glorious movie franchise. How to get rich by doing absolutely nothing. \\nA 4-yr old would have written a more plausible and engaging plot\\nBenicio del Toro deserves a spank for lending his face to this piece of crap \\nIt made me not want to watch the last episode","true":true}
