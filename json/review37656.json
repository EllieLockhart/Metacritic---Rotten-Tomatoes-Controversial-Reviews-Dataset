Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There\u2019s a lot of people with strong opinions about this movie whether it\u2019s love or hate. I actually really loved this movie. I would place it as #4 on my list of Star Wars films. This film felt new and\\, unlike a lot of my counterpart hardcore Star Wars fans\\, I really enjoyed this new feel. The movie does have some lackluster moments (Rose\/Finn\\, Holdo) but the highs of this movie were some of the best in the series along with Vader\/Luke in ESB and the Duel on Mustafar in Episode III. I\u2019ve seen it twice and plan on going a third (possibly 4th) and\\, if you didn\u2019t like it the first time\\, give it a second chance and go see it again. It got even better the second time.","true":true}
