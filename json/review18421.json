Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is as if the director was given a golden egg and instead of making a movie with substance\\, likable characters\\, and intelligent plot points. They instead rushed a movie without adding anything to the storey. What a shame\\, this was just a money grab. The only redeming part was the visuals but they can not make up for this train wreck of a movie.","true":true}
