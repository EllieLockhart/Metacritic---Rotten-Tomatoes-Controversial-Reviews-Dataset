Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Created rotten tomatoes account for the first time for this review.\\n\\nSaw this abomination today. This is a movie of contrivances. As if the writers started out with some agenda or message they wanted to get out and then threw Star Wars clothing on top of it. As a result\\, this is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time and it effectively destroys the franchise. I will not bother to isolate myself to not spoil the next movie. I'll wait and read the people's reviews first but I doubt I'll even bother with it at all after this.\\n\\nI went into this with 100% positive expectations and no spoilers.\\n\\nAccio broom!","true":true}
