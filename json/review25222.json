Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nice visuals I guess\\, but this managed to be even more confusing and riddled with plot holes than episode VII. Unlikeable new characters\\, inconsistency with said new characters\\, and a complete disregard for the spirit of the franchise.","true":true}
