Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sloppy storytelling with mediocre dialogue. It\u2019s a travesty with what Rian did with Luke Skywalker\\, and I\u2019m thankful he didn\u2019t have the chance to meddle with any other iconic characters. The casino scene reminding me of the prequels in fluff\\, but even those had fluff with purpose. The casino scene had no rhyme or reason\\, or if it did\\, it lacked and true connections to the main plot line. I wish this movie never existed. ","true":true}
