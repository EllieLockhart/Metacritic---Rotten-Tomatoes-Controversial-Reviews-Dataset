Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"That the critic consensus on this is 93% is nothing short of baffling. This film is a betrayal of everything that Star Wars stands for as a mythos and\\, beyond that\\, all-around terrible on its own merits: sloppy writing\\, sloppy editing\\, sloppy jokes\\, sloppy CGI. No heart and no conviction. If you are a life-long fan of Star Wars (and especially of Luke Skywalker)\\, make better use of your time by simply re-watching the original trilogy. And finally\\, a content warning: you have to look at shirtless Adam Driver and watch Luke drink fresh milk from the sagging udders of a naked alien ant-eater. I expect a class action lawsuit against Rian Johnson for emotional damages any day now.","true":true}
