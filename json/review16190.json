Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm guess all the clueless bot who claim to not like this fantastic action film are not true Star Wars fans. It's everything you could want and more. Excellent fight scenes\\, solid acting\\, brilliant directing and visuals\\, and top notch writing. The Force is indeed strong in that one.","true":true}
