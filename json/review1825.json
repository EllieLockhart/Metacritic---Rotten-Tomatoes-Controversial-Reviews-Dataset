Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As conflicted as I may be after watching the Last Jedi\\,I have to admit that this one changes Star Wars.I don't think I like this and I'm curious to see if Abrams will follow Jonson's lead. That being said\\, as a Star Wars fan I will stick to the positive aspects.The  performances are the best we have ever seen in the saga.Mark Hamill and Adam Driver are exceptional.Oscar Isaac was passionate and witty.The rest of the cast were also very satisfying.The scenes between Kylo Ren and Rey were moving and conveyed the tension between them masterfully.The  battles were epic.The final 40 minutes were overally exciting and beautiful.And finally\\,the reason I forgive all the fillm's flaws: what a way for Luke to go go out.They couldn't have done it better.","true":true}
