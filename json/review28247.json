Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poorly written\\, too much poor humor ruined the feel of the movie and some characters. Characters were changed and not for the better\\, the plot was pointless. It tried too hard to be funny and innovative and it failed. While it had many entertaining scenes and some fantastic visuals\\, the cons outweigh the pros with this movie. I rank it on the same level as Attack of the Clones. This movie was very disappointing.","true":true}
