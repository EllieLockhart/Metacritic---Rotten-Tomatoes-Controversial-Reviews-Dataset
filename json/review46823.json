Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well\\, one thing that \\\"Star Wars: The Last of the Jedi\\\" does is practically recreate the original Empire vs. Rebels conflict\\, both in imagery and characters\\, complete with a disfigured and aged evil emperor (apparently\\, the rebels are very poor stewards of republican democracy\\, and must be in perpetual rebellion against a perpetual imperial foe).  Frankly\\, were it not for the spectacular visuals (implausible sound effects notwithstanding)\\, the first 30 minutes would be an impossible bore to endure.  But\\, happily - and not a desperate moment too soon\\, despite the heavy initial use of the threadbare and formulaic Hollywood devices\\, or the persistent use of one in particular with the Luke Skywalker character (can we say\\, yet again\\, 'reluctant hero story'?)\\, the movie does mid-way pull away from its oppressive predictability into surprising turn of events\\, so that it finally manages\\, if barely\\, to be more than a dull re-telling of the original Star Wars saga.  Still\\, neither Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker nor Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia (she will always be a princess to me) ever manage to be compelling.  That minimally achieved accomplishment goes to Adam Driver as Kylo Ren.\\n\\nSeparately\\, the appearance of Captainette Phasma is frankly embarrassing.  This attempt to have Star Wars further comply with Feminist ideology falls flat with the soft\\, feminine voice that emanates from a very shiny armor.  \\\"I am woman\\, hear me breathily roar\\\" - yawn.  Meanwhile\\, the character of Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo as played by Laura Dern tries mightily to convince us that military grit and tough leadership in the middle of dire prospects\\, can come from someone concerned with making a feminine fashion statement fit for\\, as the movie itself admits\\, \\\"a night at the opera\\,\\\" - 'tries' being the operative word.  \\n\\\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\\" is a lot like a most movies\\, and even many professions and other enterprises today: it follows 'a process' and is thus reliably mediocre.\\n\\nThis movie is certified by North Korean-trained commissars of the Hollywood Division of the Human Re-education Campaign (HRC) as MODERATELY compliant with the fantasies of Feminist Gender Ideology - but not for lack of trying.","true":true}
