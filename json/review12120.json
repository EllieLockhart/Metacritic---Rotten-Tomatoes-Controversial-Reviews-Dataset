Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a generation X\\, so loved the original Star Wars trilogy as I grew up. But I am not sure what has happened with the Disney versions of the new Star Wars. I don't know... but it has lost its magic. Not much about the mystical force... or great battle scenes... or the classic journey of training to become a noble Jedi. It is like just bunch of kids running around. And what did they do to Luke's character? They made him into a depressive who has lost all hope in life. Sorry\\, a spoiler...(And he leaves on a whimper! No great final Jedi battle... just fades away!) Mmmm... great visuals as to be expected\\, but something is missing. Disappointed.","true":true}
