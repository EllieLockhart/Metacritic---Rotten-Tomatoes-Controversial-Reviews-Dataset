Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a sjw film not a star wars film. There is no cohesion and it drags on and on. I don't need to list the numerous things wrong\\, It's been done.\\n\\nBut perhaps the worst of all is how the flashback we are shown in the tfa awakens shows kylo ren with his helmet destroying the Jedi temple. In this one we are shown he was just a boy. What gives? Never in the history of star wars movies has there been an inconsistency of this magnitude. It cannot be both.  One of the movies is now wrong. I guess this is what we should expect moving forward. It's the same with Disney mcu. No cohesion. At all. A different director with each movie with no plot to follow and each director is allowed \\\"their own vision\\\".\\n\\nIt's the worst star wars at best and a outright atrocity at worst. What they did to mark hamill was sick. Luke is star wars. Have you seen the vid of his reaction at the premier? Not only did the ruin an iconic hero\\, but the mouse didn't even have the balls to tell him they were going to. They re shot the end without his knowledge. Seriously watch the video\\, It's not hard to find.\\n\\nTo Mark\\, you are and will always be the hero of the gffa and not even the new Disney can take that away from you. May the force be with you","true":true}
