Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Gre\u00e0t fun movie. It has the jeapoardy of Empire Strikes Back but isn't a rehash of the original trilogy great. Some sad moments. There'll definitely be a few damp eyes in each showing. Great spectacle. Some amazing lightsabre battles.","true":true}
