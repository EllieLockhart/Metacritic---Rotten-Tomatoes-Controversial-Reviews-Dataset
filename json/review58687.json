Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I have no idea why people are bashing this game.. What happens early in the story is the driving force for a story that compelements the first one in a perfect way. I kept myself away from the leaks and even avoided most of the trailers\\, but knowing that it'll be a revenge story\\, I knew what was going to happen and I was prepared for it. The plot point that I'm talking about didn't make me want to flush the game. It made me seek revenge and that was the force that kept me going\\, until my mind was so complicated by the masterful storytelling that I didn't even know what I wanted anymore. The game kept me totally on the hook and left me breathless in the end. Visually and gameplay-wise it obviously tops the first one and I had a lot of fun playing through it. The story was emotionally hard experience\\, but I enjoyed every single second of it. I've played a lot of games during my life. Multiple universally acclaimed titles and I'm brutally honest when I'm saying this: The Last of Us Part 2 is definitely one of the best games I've ever played. I'm really bad with top lists\\, but this game (together with the first one) belong to the top three. A true masterpiece. Hands down.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
