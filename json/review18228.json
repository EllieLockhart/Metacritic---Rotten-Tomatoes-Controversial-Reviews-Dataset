Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought some of the comedy came across as slapstick and was not needed. I did love the movie and though it better than TFA. To all those pointing out about physics in space and lack of reality\\, it's Star Wars. Lightsaber\\, star destroyers\\, having an upside in space\\, the Force\\, none of these thinks smack of reality\\, so stop it. If that's your reason for hating a film then you must like the MCU or X-men\\, or really anything of that ilk since they all take liberties with what can actually happen. That's why it's fiction\\, it helps you escape the reality of the real world.","true":true}
