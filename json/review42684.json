Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was fantastic! I enjoyed everything about this film and it kept me engaged the entire time. Its just as good\\, if not better than the Force Awakens. For the life of me\\, I don't understand why the audience score is so low. So may great moments\\, good humor\\, and action packed!","true":true}
