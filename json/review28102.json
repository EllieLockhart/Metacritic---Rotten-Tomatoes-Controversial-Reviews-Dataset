Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pluses:\\nHigh production value.\\n\\nMinuses:\\nEverything else.\\n\\nI'm not a crazy Star Wars fan\\, but I enjoyed the original trilogy\\, as I think most people have. The prequels weren't that great\\, but I got what I wanted\\, more of the story from the Star Wars universe. After waiting more than 30 years to see how the original trilogy continues\\, I was so sadly disappointed. This is not a sequel. There is no character development\\, there are no story arcs. It's just a collection of McGuffins\\, inappropriately timed humor\\, and marketing ploys\\, to support a very poor plagiarism of the original trilogy. They could have done better writing the story with Mad Libs\\, at least there would be some structure to it.\\n\\nBottom line: This is not \\\"Star Wars\\\" but a blatant money grab by trying to steal as much of the past as possible. On top of that they had to insert several cheap political points. If you made the mistake of watching this movie\\, please go see the original trilogy again. Avoid this movie.","true":true}
