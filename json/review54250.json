Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not a bot.\\n\\nI love Star Wars!!! I love the originals\\, I liked the prequels\\, I enjoyed The Force Awakens and I absolutely loved Rogue One. With that being said\\, I really HATED The Last Jedi. Visually it's probably the best Star Wars film to date\\, and the fight scene in Snoke's chambers was epic. But that is where the positives of this film end.\\n\\nI thought maybe I was just being harsh when I saw it in theatres but I was actually more upset watching it a second time realizing all my initial reactions were only magnified. The plot sucks\\, the comedic dialogue is awful\\, some of the acting is cringeworthy and they disrespect the original films and it's fans at every opportunity they can. I won't be seeing solo or any other Star Wars film in theatres unless they publicly denounce this film and Rian Johnson.","true":true}
