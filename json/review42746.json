Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was horrendous. It did not have a coherent plotline\\, and more importantly did not stay with the spirit of the Star Wars trilogy. Actually\\, it did the opposite\\, ruining many characters from the past trilogies just for fun. It even ruined the character development for many characters that were just created in the last movie.","true":true}
