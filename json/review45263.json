{"101487":191154,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-01","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"UPDATE - I have revised my review score DOWN after seeing the third movie of the trilogy and realizing just how fully this movie wrecked the franchise. It caused the third movie to burn valuable screen time trying to fix problems and add story points that this film ignored. A film so incredibly poorly written that it damaged the entire Star Wars canon. To Disney\\, and any writers and directors that take up this franchise in the future: take your source material seriously\\, and don't treat your audience like idiots that just want to see big screen explosions.\\n\\nORIGINAL REVIEW - \\nA film that that I found ultimately disappointing - not terrible\\, but sort of hollow. Warning\\, may contain spoilers.\\n\\nI had hope after Episode VII\\, despite it's flaws\\, that perhaps  in this Star Wars movie the team would really come together and make something new\\, exciting\\, and special\\, but unfortunately they continued the trend of preferring to weakly echo classic Star Wars moments in favor of original writing and new development.\\n\\nThe problem is in the writing. Why is it so weak? Why\\, with more than 30 years of an absolute wealth of depth and original writing from excellent authors in the Star Wars genre\\, does it feel like none of those great ideas made it into the movie? The Clone Wars animated series and the video games have more depth than this movie.\\n\\nProblem 1: The screenplay\\, and the lame First Order. What is the First Order? Where did it come from? Who is Snoke\\, aside from a CG boogeyman that weakly echos the emperor?  The Empire was defeated in Episode VI\\, and there is hardly any connection between then and now. This movie needed to fill in those gaps from Episode VII\\, and didn't. There is no emotional link nor intellectual explanation between then and now. Why is there a resistance\/rebellion? In the books\\, there was the New Republic formed after the fall of the Empire\\, and Leia became Chancellor - and there were still plenty of awe-inspiring battles against Imperial remnants\\, a clone of the Emperor\\, and various alien factions. After the 2nd new movie\\, I now think\\, more than ever\\, that it was a terrible mistake to disregard all that writing. Had they adopted an approach where they adapted one or more books into a screenplay\\, or at least used the books to fill in historical background\\, and used a team of writers\\, like in The Lord of the Rings\\, I think they could have invented a much stronger story.\\n\\nProblem 2: Poor characterization. I think Rey and Ben are perhaps the most solidly fleshed out\\, if not perfect\\, but the rest of the cast is like an empty shell. This is partially a problem with the writing\\, and partially a problem with the casting - there is a definite lack of charisma amongst the cast as a whole. I don't dislike Finn\\, but his character motivations are weak and ill-defined\\, as is his relationship to Captain Phasma. This movie had Finn running around doing a bunch of stuff\\, but almost none of it added anything interesting to his character\\, or contained any kind of character development. When Phasma met her end\\, it was like... who cares? She's just a shiny Stormtrooper that makes a nice kid's toy. She's had zero character development.\\n\\nProblem 3: Constantly needing to reference original Star Wars moments: Okay\\, some callbacks are fine\\, but when you are bending your screenplay backwards to accommodate these moments\\, the priorities are wrong. Rey foolishly goes to Ben\\, just like Luke went to his father. She even wears very similar handcuffs. Ben kills Snoke\\, just like Vader killed the Emperor. Snoke taunts Rey with destruction\\, just like the Emperor... except it's all several times less dramatic and like a weak echo that is just eating up screen time. And then we do a Hoth assault in reverse\\, except for visually appealing red salt flats hidden underneath. Do something new\\, dammit.\\n\\nProblem 4: Being in such an obvious hurry to shuffle the original actors off to their deaths. Maybe this is by contractual necessity\\, but you could have given Luke a much greater part and practically hung the next two movies on Mark Hamill. He brought some gravity to a movie that under-utilized his talents\\, failed to really let him live up to the power and wisdom of a Jedi-master\\, and then vanished him into nothingness because... he pulled a Jedi muscle? Overexerted himself? Had he pulled that trick and then lived\\, it would have been far more satisfying.\\n\\nSomehow\\, despite the greater capacity for special effects\\, this movie feels... smaller\\, much smaller than the original trilogy. Somehow\\, even Lucas' prequels\\, for all their many faults\\, feel far larger in terms of scope of storytelling and imagination.","true":true}
