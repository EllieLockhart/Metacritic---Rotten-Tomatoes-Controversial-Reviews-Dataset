Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall a severe disappointment. There was no semblance of a connection between the first and second movies. They didn't even try to answer the questions that were asked in The Force Awakens. They just brushed them aside and said\\, \\\"it doesn't matter.\\\" It is a good thing that JJ Abrams is taking back over on the last one so he can complete his story.","true":true}
