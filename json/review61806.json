Last of Us 2 isn't a perfect title in my books\\, but at least from a narrative perspective it breaks into new territories\\, creating a coherent experience from the beginning until the end\\, with one of the best video game endings I've seen so far. It's in the gameplay where the game tends to fall apart\\, but in it's best moments it shines really bright. It features one of the most compelling enemy AIs I've seen so far\\, which generates an infinite amount of surprises. In its best moments the games challenges have the complexity of a puzzle which adapts and generates new combat situations on the go. It's the juicy emergent behaviour many designers strive for these days. At the same time TLOU2 features many questionable design decisions which carried over from Naughty Dogs old titles\\, but didn't age that well with the new game concept. I really dislike the choice of plants in such complex environments to indicate interactable objects. The inventory system doesn't hold up in stressful boss fights and looting is just a pain\\, especially chaotic environments like a hardware store. Also\\, the companion AI is really laking in many instances.\r\rIt's saddening to see a bland incoherent title like Ghost of Tsushima get a user rating of 9.3\\, while a novel work like TLOU 2 gets a mediocre user score. I personally don't feel like I can trust user ratings on metacritic anymore. Whether there's a lack of trustworthiness in those reviews or whether I just grew apart from the common taste I can't tell. I certainly hope the former is the case. I also hope that the sales numbers of TLOU2 don't reflect this sentiment\\, because I really want to see more of this kind of work from you guys at Naughty Dog.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
