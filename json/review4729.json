Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Completely disappointed and feel way too many \\\"big\\\" things happened.  Like Empire Strikes Back\\, where Vader reveals he is Luke's father was a game changer\\, Snoke getting killed\\, Rey tasting the dark side\\, Luke dying.....WAAYYYYY too much sensory overload and zero storyline.  Booooooo.........","true":true}
