Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":" Decent\\, but not up to the standard of the best Star Wars episodes. Daisy Ridley does an excellent job\\, and Adam Driver matches\\, but the rest of the cast is just OK. Plot resolves the saga in a satisfactory manner\\, but overall the storyline seemed contrived and \u201cDisneyfied\u201d\\, as was the last episode. Not sure what\u2019s next for Rey.","true":true}
