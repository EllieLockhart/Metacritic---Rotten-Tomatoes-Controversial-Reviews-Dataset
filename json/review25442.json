Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nope.  Not a good movie.  Could have been and should have been but wasn't.  It was like going to the prom with your cousin.  Should be a magical night\\, but you're with your cousin.\\n\\nReally bad new characters took screen time away from developing the ones from The Force Awakens.  I could have done without the casino scene and Rose completely.  I actually found myself grinding my teeth in frustration everytime she was on screen because we had to endure her anti-capitalist lectures when we could have seen super awesome Star Wars kind of battles with lightsabers or something else epic.\\n\\nNot worth your time or money.  See it on Netflix.","true":true}
