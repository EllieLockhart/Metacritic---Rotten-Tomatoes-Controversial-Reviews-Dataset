Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sadly the worst Star Wars movie ever. Comes across as having been made by someone with no understanding of the Star Wars universe\\, and worse\\, not even caring to find out about it. There are attempts at humor that make you just cringe. Luke Skywalker is completely wasted in this movie\\, what a shame\\, WHAT A SHAME. It looked like Snoke would turn out to be an interesting character but we don\u2019t get to learn anything about him and then he is unceremoniously killed off. Rey Is a great character but here again we have a character who is wasted\\, she\u2019s all over the place\\, the movie should have focused more on her. The new characters are totally uninteresting\\, and sad to say it but you have to wonder why any one would be following princess Leia into battle after seeing this movie. I could go on but I won\u2019t. As bad as the Phantom Menace was this one is hands-down the worst Star Wars movie of all time. God help us if Johnson has any hand in subsequent Star Wars projects. May the force be with you. Always.","true":true}
