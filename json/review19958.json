Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"it was fun to watch in a really shallow way but was wrong in the way things ended for the main characters. also too many gaurdians of the galaxy\/thor ragnorok jokes. the first joke was so cringeworthy. All that said it was a fun movie but serious fans will be dissapointed.","true":true}
