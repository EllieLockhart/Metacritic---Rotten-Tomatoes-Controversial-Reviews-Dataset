Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS        \\n\\n\\nJust another Social Justice agenda push by the CEO of LucasArts. Rose is the new Jar Jar Binks\\, Poe is useless\\, Chewbacca is Vegan\\, Rey knows how to use FORCE levitation with NO training\\, Luke is a coward\\, Kylo Ren is a bigger brat than Anakin from Episode 2 and Snoke is a huge disappointment. Oh and Leia is a FORCE master user.","true":true}
