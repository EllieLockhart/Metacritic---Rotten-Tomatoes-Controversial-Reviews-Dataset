Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing the film twice\\, I am still satisfied. This film is ambitious and original\\, adding new lore and expanding upon a vast universe. Yes\\, it has its problems but most movies do. There are somethings they should've left out and some things that should've been added to she'd light on some very much needed answers from The Force Awakens. This is in no way as bad as the prequels like a lot of fans are saying it is. There are some social and political issues in the film that mirror our own society that I could've gone without. Other than that and a few characters that weren't needed in my opinion; this to me is the best and most fresh Star Wars we've gotten since Empire and JJ has a monumental task on his hands to keep that fresh flavor going with Episode IX.","true":true}
