Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointing I front know where to start.  Finn and Rose were completely irrelevant to the movie... The plot was a slow car chase across the galaxy??????  Luke was \\, well\\, not Luke.   Kylo as the new Vader??  Whiney and petty\\, Vader was calm cool and collected.  Star wars is a space drama \\, but this was not.  I was excited to see this movie\\, but I'm almost sorry I did.","true":true}
