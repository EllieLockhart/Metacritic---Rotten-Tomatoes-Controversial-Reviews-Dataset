Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are so many things wrong with this movie it's hard to know where to begin.  I'm fine with them not playing it safe with the characters but this is a complete trainwreck.  Everything set up by TFA is cast aside.  Snoke\\, the \\\"good story for another time\\\" Luke's light saber story\\, Knight's of Ren\\, Rey's parents\\, Finn and Phasma.  None of it matters now we get grumpy\\, cowardly Force hating Luke milking space alien sea monster boobies\\, Superman\/Mary Poppins Princess Leia\\, All powerful\/no training Rey and a bunch of pointless scenes that only serve to force feed the masses their social justice crap.  All rich people are bad and are the worst in all the galaxy\\, animal cruelty is bad(no kidding) all men are evil or bumbling idiots that need to be saved by women and don't eat meat cause animals are cute. Phasma is brought back just to kill her off. Everything that's been established in forty years of Star Wars mythology has been destroyed by one movie.  It doesn't make any sense.  I'm a life long Star Wars fanatic and I'm done.","true":true}
