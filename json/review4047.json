Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Brazenly contemptuous of the source material\\, old characters are killed off for cheap shock value. And for a movie supposedly made by an SJW he sure doesn't portray females in a flattering way. At every opportunity they are shown to be incompetent\\, mindless and dangerous...heck the only strong male bad guy is a dimwit wearing a dress. Possible troll? You decide...Cool effects though","true":true}
