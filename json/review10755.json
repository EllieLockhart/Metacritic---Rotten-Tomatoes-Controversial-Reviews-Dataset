Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Half way through the movie it finally started up from \\\"feelings through the force\\\" and I know this a new hope but there shouldn't be any changes in how the force is used\\, feelings like fear are to be controlled other wise it will lead to the dark side. Star wars should be praised for it past diversity and not subjected to the current main stream political campaign of the USA by having all leader roles led solely by women\\, but i do see there may be an allowance for Poe to be the next leader\\, good so keep the diversity.","true":true}
