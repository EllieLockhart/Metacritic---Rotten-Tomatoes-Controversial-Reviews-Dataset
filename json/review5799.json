Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointed in Disney. This movie had poor plot lines\\, confusing stories with incomplete character development. Poor Mark Hamill. He is a great actor that was handed a badly written story. Luke Skywalker is not that grouchy selfish pitty party in a robe that Rian Johnson put on the big screen.","true":true}
