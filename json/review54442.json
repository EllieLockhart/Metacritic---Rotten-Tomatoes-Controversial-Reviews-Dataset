Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I literally just signed up to combat the fake reviews for this steaming pile of garbage. If you liked any other Star Wars movies you'll hate this. The fake reviews are all one liners of  \\\" the greatest movie ever\\\" but any bad review reveals multiple reasons of how bad this movie is. The blantant disregard for every one of the Force Awake setups\\, the total changing of the personality of a  legacy character like Luke who played like \\\"Jake\\\" Skywalker\\, the COMPLETELY USELESS AND POINTLESS side story that takes up a quarter of the film while adding NOTHING but a vapid \\, inelegant\\, and hamfisted attempt to spread a social injustice message\\, the characters acting in a nonsensical way just to advance plot conveniences like not sharing their critical plans in a desperate moment\\, one dimensional characters with no substance and no emotional attachment\\, Rey is a master Jedi in terms of skill with absolutely no training and no explanation why other than to advance her as the  protagonist in the story\\,  I'm not even going to go into it in depth but google Flying Leia ...The ONLY good thing I can say is visually it was a good movie but a entrancing painting isn't a movie. Now check out the 5 star reviews and see if they can say that many good things about the movie. Please for the sake of the franchise fire the whole creative team and Kathleen Kennedy and make sure Ruin Johnson's new trilogy is consigned to the trash heap of history","true":true}
