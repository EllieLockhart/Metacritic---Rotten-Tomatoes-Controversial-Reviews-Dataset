Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi brings brand new premises to the Starwars legacy. Bold new choices for new and old characters\\, expansion of existing lore\\, and creative solutions all add a very distinct sense of new-ness to Star Wars that many argued was missing from TFA.\\n\\nThis movie isn't perfect. It wont make you feel the way you expect a Star Wars movie to. It wont answer all your questions\\, and what it does answer might not be as satisfying as you wanted.\\nIn a lot of ways\\, it's a polar opposite of its recent predecessors.  TFA & R1 immediately grabbed the audience and thrilled them\\, but started to show serious cracks over time.\\n\\nTLJ may have been unsettling for many viewers\\, but I do believe the new expansion of the universe\\, it's rules and inhabitants\\, and the complex themes will grow on you with time.\\n\\nIt is a must-see for any Star Wars fan\\, but you probably wont walk out of the theater without some serious mixed feelings.","true":true}
