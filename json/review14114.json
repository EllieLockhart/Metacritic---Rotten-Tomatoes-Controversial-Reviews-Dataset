Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you think this is a propaganda film engineered by the left\\, you're an idiot.  If you think that the choices and wasted plot lines this movie incessantly chases down work\\, you're fooling yourself.  If you're a fan of Star Wars\\, you're most likely disappointed.","true":true}
