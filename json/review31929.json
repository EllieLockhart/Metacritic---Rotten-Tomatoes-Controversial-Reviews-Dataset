Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoiler-free review:\\nAs the biggest SW fan it pains me to say this film was a let down. It seems I'm not the only one given it's currently the lowest rated SW film via Audience Score on RT. Yes\\, there were amazing moments: it was intense\\, and I was kept at the edge of my seat\\, but it lacked emotional weight because I find myself caring less and less for these characters. The storyline and direction of this movie is disappointing to the point I'm not even that intrigued by how this trilogy will end. UGH\\nI didn't leave the theater with the usual fanboy excitement....I mean even with the prequels I came out thinking they were pretty awesome and epic in my younger years. Of course over time and with reflection the hype fades and I realize the issues\/flaws when the fanboy goggles come off. Unfortunately with episode 8\\, I left the theater feeling empty...critics are loving it...maybe it was for them instead of the fanboys...or maybe I'll look back on this one day and realize I was wrong or perhaps I need to see the next film in order to understand the direction\/vision for this saga... end of rant.","true":true}
