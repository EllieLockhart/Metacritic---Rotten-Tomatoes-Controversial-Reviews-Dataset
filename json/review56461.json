Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The entire premise of TLJ is subversion\\, from Luke's reaction to being handed his sabre and the line \\\"This isn't going to go the way you think\\\"\\, the burning of 'what has gone before'\\, to Snoke's identity and Rey's parents\\, it's clear that unlike Abram's TFA\\, Johnson has actively tried to steer away from where SW fans expect it to go. It doesn't always work\\, but I applaud him for attempting something so out of left-field that it has those that thought they knew which way it was heading (based on past entries and their own theories) completely dumb-founded and in some cases\\, angry. It may be a money-making franchise\\, but it is still 'art' in a creative sense of the word\\, and it has provoked a reaction. if anything it's shown just how intolerable some supposed fans are (the ones creating petitions etc)\\, which were trashing the last movie for being too much like the previous ones and are now trashing this for being not enough like those same movies.\\n\\nAs for those stating it shows nothing but disdain for Skywalker. One presumes they have never had any hardship in their life and gone through with a moral streak that could almost entitle them to Saint status. Heroes sometimes fail and it is possible for a hero to do so\\, without being seen as urinating on fans' childhoods. The overreaction to what has been done here is embarrassing to some of us whom consider ourselves fans.\\n\\nIs it perfect? No. Does everything work? No. However\\, I applaud both Johnson and Disney for trying something different.\\n\\nDon't be swayed by the - IMO - unjustified derogatory reviews of this movie\\, simply because it doesn't fir in with how they think it should go. If you're a SW fan who actually wants the series to diverge from the same old tropes\\, go see this. You may be pleasantly surprised.","true":true}
