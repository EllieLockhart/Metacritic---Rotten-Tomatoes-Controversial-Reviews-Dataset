Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Incredibly disappointing. It abandons what made Star Wars so great and memorable in the first place. Instead of  modern mythology\\, a fairytale in space\\, Last Jedi feels like it was crafted exclusively by marketers trying as hard as they can to tick off as many boxes as they can to appeal to the largest possible base without much of a care for compelling characters or a compelling story. Star Wars by its very nature is not a piece of hard science fiction\\, and many elements of the original trilogy taken individually can be questioned from a logical standpoint\\, everything was in service to the hero's journey and the development of a small core of main characters who grow and develop believable relationships throughout the three films.\\n\\nNow\\, it seems\\, all that care is out the window. Take Rose for example. Introduced in this film\\, her only roles are to accompany Finn (a character who already is poorly fleshed out and rarely serves any meaningful role to the plots of both films so far) on an utterly pointless subplot that exists to hamfistedly force an emotional attachment to her character and introduce plot points which could easily have been put in place on the rebel ship (a codebreaker and intel on weapon suppliers). There is no real sense of concern for either of their characters. Poe Dameron ultimately does absolutely nothing\\, as his contributions and efforts are ultimately superceded by yet another new character\\, the vice admiral\\, in a ridiculous sequence which breaks the rules of the universe as laid out int he film. Why not use hyperspace to end every confrontation? If you're going to use relativity\\, even a proton fired at light speed can destroy a planet\\, let alone a ship. The move is a mess\\, gives a disappointing end for Luke Skywalker\\, relies too heavily on large CGI setpieces and an overabundance of weak humor which continuously pulls the audience from feelings of a threat or seriousness. It's very sad to see that Disney only cares about producing easily digestible\\, overly processed\\, and weakly written Star Wars films which feel like a Marvel movie in space.","true":true}
