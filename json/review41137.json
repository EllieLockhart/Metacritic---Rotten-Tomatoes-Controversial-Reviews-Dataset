Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has a high contrast of cool shit and dumb shit - not as bad as people say but definitely not as good.\\n\\n!SPOILERS!\\n\\nThe part where Leia 'force pulls' herself to safety is absolute cancer and was the low point of the movie\\, in addition to that they gave Admiral Ackbar an off-screen death which is totally fucked up. Finn had nothing to do\\, In fact he should never have woken up because this leads to him meeting the worst character in the movie; Rose and I and many alike could rant for hours about her flawed character arch. If the purple haired lady (who looked so out of place in a Star Wars Movie) would have just told everyone the plan then Poe wouldn't have done a mutiny\\, 'DJ' wouldn't reveal the plan and loads of lives would've been saved. Rey was ok (Daisy Ridley isn't so much a good actor)\\,although the force connection with Kylo Ren should not have existed\\, her story was something I've come to predict in a star wars movie. I'd give the writers praise for the basis of the story but ultimately so much could've been cut; the movie goes on and on and Finn should've been cut from the movie for him to make up on the red salt planet. Luke Skywalker was a straight up arsehole for the duration of the movie\\, he may have been able to redeem himself if he murdered all the Porgs but he didn't.  \\n\\nAll in all a very dumb movie as a star wars fan but the movie itself is pretty ok and it is definitely better than the prequels. Also whoever invented the Porgs need a hard kick in the jaw.","true":true}
