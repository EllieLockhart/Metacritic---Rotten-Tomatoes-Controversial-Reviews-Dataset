Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Use to be huge SW fan when I was a kid. I hated this movie when I saw it in 2017. My ~10 yr old kids didn't like it either. Watched it again. Initial thought: maybe it was not that bad I just had too high expectations the first time. Nope\\, this is a bad movie. And this review has nothing to do with the fact that I was SW fan as a child. The are million things of mediocre quality in the movie. Key problems: bad dialogue\\, no emotional depth\\, crappy humor. I really wonder how the team was able to make such a mess after The Force Awakens\\, which was pretty ok and\\, especially\\, set a good concept and landscape. Maybe the pressure was just too much. Johnson's previous movie Looper was also pretty good. Here the guy really killed Star Wars. And the greatest mystery: why movie critics give good scores on average? This film and critics' behavior have changed how I view the whole business.","true":true}
