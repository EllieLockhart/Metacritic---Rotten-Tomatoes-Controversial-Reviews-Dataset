Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bad movie that wasn't a Star Wars!- It was just a vaguely interesting visually appealing standard super hero action movie with good feminist themes...but overly simplistic\\, full of holes\\, slapstick humor\\, contrite lessons -- but not a Star Wars. \\n\\nI grew up with Star Wars and the constant leaps this movie made me take around how the Star Wars universe worked and just common sense was too much.There were endless holes and weird turns to justify long subplots and contrite lessons...plus dumb slapstick humor. (dumb sub-plots- the running out of gas chase...the casino plot...the fight with female storm trooper..etc...)\\n\\nAs a Star Wards fan\\, remaking Luke's character was almost intriguing\\, but overdone.  You can't take one of the most simplistic lovable heroes and make him suddenly a grouchy old fart who can project himself across the universe with the force (this is a thing...as bad as Leah flying in space)\\n\\nThere were a few high points\\, but none of it made up for how bad this was.  If they wanted to make a simplistic super hero visual spectacle movie with one-liner humor\\, contrite lessons\\, that goes on too long (I thought it was ending three times)...they should have just made another one of those and not called it Star Wars.","true":true}
