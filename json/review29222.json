Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Repetitive.  How many times are audiences going to pay to watch the same situations occur but with different characters and locations.  Remember when Luke fought Darth Vader in front of the emperor?  Yeah\\, it's here.  Remember when Luke turned himself in to the empire in the hopes of turning Darth back to the light?  That's here too.  How about when Luke went off to train with Yoda?  Yup\\, in this movie too.  Need I go on?  Just go back and watch the first trilogy.  The 'graphics' might suck when set up against today's standards but at least the story was original.","true":true}
