Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a perfect movie\\, but still an interesting take on the Star Wars universe. Our biggest complaint about TFA was \u201ctoo formulaic\u201d and \u201cnot original\u201d. Here we have an honest shot at carrying a story that is nothing but ordinary and fanboys seem hellbent on crying foul. Johnson threw out a lot of what you expected from Star Wars and made a fresh new film\\, where your heroes are flawed (very flawed) and your nostalgia is a thing of the past. This brought forward a new Star Wars generation and I applaud the attempt. Still had problems but I\u2019m willing to forgive. Editing review: giving an extra half star. Seriously\\, the people dropping 0-2 star reviews need to slow their role and enjoy a well shot and enjoyable movie. Still\\, not perfect\\, but I\u2019m very happy with this film\u2019s place in Star Wars lore. ","true":true}
