Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Storylines that are designed to increase run time plague this film\\, as countless universe breaking concepts are dropped and then forgotten in what is a mess of exciting visual effects coupled with poor story telling that is utterly forgettable\\, but entertaining. Easily the worst addition to the franchise since the Clone Wars\\, but still worth $9 if you want to be hip\\, or $1.75 if you are to wait for Redbox.","true":true}
