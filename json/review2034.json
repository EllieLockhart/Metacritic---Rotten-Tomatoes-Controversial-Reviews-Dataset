{"101487":105958,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-09","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As someone who loves the original trilogy\\, tolerated the flawed prequels with good humour and honestly loved both Rogue One and The Force Awakens\\, i was devastated by how terrible The Last Jedi was. \\nThe issues are myriad. Firstly\\, in a general overview\\, one gets the impression that the lovingly crafted world of Star Wars was carefully added to and cared for by Abrams and Edwards\\, then gently passed with both hands to Rian Johnson\\, who then treated the beloved franchise as his own personal play-area. Legacies of great characters were destroyed\\, carefully constructed plot points were reversed or declared moot\\, and most astonishingly 45+ minutes of screen time are wasted on a 'humourous' side quest that ends up a waste of the characters' time and provides precisely zero character development. Yes\\, that's right\\, the casino.\\nAs Finn and Rose rescue some horse like creatures and gallop through the night\\, I realised just how bored I was. \\n\\nAnd Leia performing a ridiculous Superman esque space flight to then spend the majority of the film unconscious was a tragic way for us to remember Fisher's final appearance as Leia. \\n\\nThe strange alien milking scene was nauseating and udderly (ha) unnecessary. As was the topless Kylo Ren scene in his Simon Cowell waisted pants.\\n\\nThe set ups of Rey's mysterious lineage and the clues to her amazing natural abilities with both Force and lightsaber are now nothing but a plothole. Her amazing raw power would make sense if she were a prophesied hero or of Force-conceived lineage like the Skywalkers\\, but now she has been revealed to be a 'nobody' the writing now appears amateurish.\\nAnd Snoke? We'll never know. We'll never know how or why he decided to turn Ben Solo\\, and how he managed it while Ben was under Luke's tutelage\\, without Luke getting an idea what was going on.\\n\\nThis brings me to the worst sin of all in this film - the assassination of the character of Luke Skywalker. Luke and Vader have always been my most beloved characters in the saga because of the complex balance and connection they share. Vader\\, wasted by twenty years of pain and hate and terrible deeds\\, healed by Luke's unwavering faith that the tiny seed of goodness still in his soul could grow. \\\"It's too late for me\\, son.\\\" Even then\\, Luke didn't give up and refused to kill Vader even when his hand was forced. So to believe that this same man who was full of hope and forgiveness would contemplate killing his own nephew\\, a minor\\, after sensing a few dark thoughts from him and actually sneak into his room in the night to murder him is absolutely impossible. It is not the same man\\, and Mark Hamill has said as much. I believe that Rian Johnson does not understand Luke Skywalker and as such should not have been allowed to write new canon for the character. It's just horrible\\, and feels like a betrayal. \\n\\nI suppose that the high ratings from the professional critics may boil down to one or two things. That they are not Star Wars fans\\, or that the Mouse is generous to those who give positive reviews...","true":true}
