Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had to see it twice before I could review and I didn\u2019t know what I thought about it at first. It was actually well thought out and a great way to add to the story!!! Excited for SW IX","true":true}
