Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a huge Star Wars fan that read all of the extended universe and loved the strong character development and cohesiveness of Star Wars. For me the last Jedi had none of this. Way too many undeveloped characters forced into \\\"dramatic\\\" situations\\, felt very forced. The dialogue was awful to many buzz words a d the jokes were childish and took away from the feel of the movie. Luke's character goes against everything he ever was for no reason at all\\, smoke is possible the least developed character. I'm sure the casual fan will love the film\\, great score\\, excellent imagery\\, but it is not for me.","true":true}
