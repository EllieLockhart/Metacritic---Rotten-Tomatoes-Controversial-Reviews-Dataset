Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was totally awful\\, lacked any real ideas..  There's no excuse either\\, if you look at the talent pool and writting ability of Disney's Rebels team you can see they are capable of so much better..  It's like their attitude is.. The fans will watch this no matter what we do so lets just use it as a platform to do so man bashing and slot in a few political commentries.","true":true}
