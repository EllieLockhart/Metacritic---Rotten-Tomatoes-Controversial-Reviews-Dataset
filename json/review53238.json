Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Brutal.  Reduced Luke\\, who was the perpetual embodiment of hope\\, to a grumpy old man who tried to kill his nephew.  Completely confused the hyperspace mechanic.  Destroyed classic characters like Akbar.  Turned Leia into some kind of Mary Poppins character.  Had a (totally inexplicable) \\\"general\\\" hold her secret plan (not really much of a plan) from her own troops (for no reason whatsoever).  Reduced lightsabers to \\\"laser swords\\\".  Furthered the Mary Sue motif of Rey.  Killed Smoke without ever explaining who the hell he was.  Had possibly the worst choreographed lightsaber fight of all time.  Kylo becomes even more pointless and confusing.  Oh\\, and Luke dies.  For no reason.  His death accomplishes nothing.\\n\\nWorst SW movie by far.  At least the prequels explained things and furthered the SW story despite the brutal dialogue and Hayden's brutal acting.  This movie just brutalized everything we knew and loved.  Worst part?  The director is SMUG about it.","true":true}
