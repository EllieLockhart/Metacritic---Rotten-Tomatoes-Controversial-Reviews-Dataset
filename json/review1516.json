Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a kid of the 70's Living on Starwars from the day I came into this world. This time sharing with my teenage daughter this was by far the best ride in my adult life. Made me feel like a kid again.","true":true}
