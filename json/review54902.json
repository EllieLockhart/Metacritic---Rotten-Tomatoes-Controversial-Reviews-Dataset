Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie\\, It makes me sad to see Star Wars heading in a direction akin to Marvel. In a franchise where people used to have to work hard to achieve things some characters are handed incredible powers on a platter\\, how can I sympathise. Luke's character is completely miss used\\, many emotional moments are thrown away with terrible jokes. Lore is completely ignored to get back to the haha rebels vs empire nostalgia. I have tried to like this movie but I cannot. But oh well this financial model works so strap yourself in for endless progressively worse remakes.","true":true}
