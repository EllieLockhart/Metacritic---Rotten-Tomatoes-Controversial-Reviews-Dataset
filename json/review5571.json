Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Did not disappoint. Was I shook? YES. Yes it was because this movie is different but I can accept the well delivered\\, thoughtful changes. The Last Jedi is taking Star Wars down a path I sure do want to follow! It's new and admittedly kind of scary\\, but I'm buckled up dammit!","true":true}
