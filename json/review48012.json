Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While not having the impact of The Force Awakens\\, Rian Johnson's sequel takes the well written and engaging characters J.J Abrams introduced and takes them\\, for the most part\\, in interesting and exciting new directions.\\n\\nThis movie rights the major flaw of TFA in that it stands very much on it's own and does not just repeat the story beats of Empire\\, but it is not itself flawless. I found the character of Finn to be largely underserved and was not too keen on where his story went for the middle act of the film. Although the setting here was pretty cool to see in a Star Wars movie\\, and it cast shades of grey upon the inhabitants of the galaxy\\, I didn't find the action scenes or overall progression of events worked all that well.\\n\\nThe new characters of Rose and Holdo in particular I thought were welcome additions\\, with Laura Dern specifically standing out.\\n\\nThe action set pieces are as fantastic and exhilarating as you would expect\\, but many of them carry an immediacy and emotional heft to them which was somewhat missing from TFA.\\n\\nThe characters of Rey and Poe are well served. They face challenges which make them question not only themselves\\, but the things they believe to be true about the world around them.\\n\\nAdam Driver as Kylo Ren is once again the scene stealer. I found everything he done to be fascinating. He is such a fantastic character and Driver's performance is excellent.\\n\\nIt's a more ambitious film than it's predecessor\\, with more to say (capitalism\\, war profiteering\\, the problems of dogmatic religions) and more risks to take with characters we know and love\\, but tries to juggle a few too many balls at once.\\n\\nI have deliberately not said anything about Luke here\\, because I think that's better to see without any preconceived ideas. I'll just say that I really liked what they did with him\\, and the overall theme of legends and heroes and the reality of such things worked well all throughout the film.\\n\\nI even welled up at a few points. Rest in Peace\\, Carrie Fisher.","true":true}
