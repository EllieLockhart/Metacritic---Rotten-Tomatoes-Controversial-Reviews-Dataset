Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Episode 8 is a mixed bag of good and bad\\, essentially it is two movie jammed together and flows just as well as that sentence implies. Abrams should have directed the entire new trilogy instead the new director ignored everything Abrams had built up and wasted several promising characters and plotlines in the process.\\n\\nThe Luke\\, Rey\\, Ren section of the movie was good but The Canto Bight sequence was very reminiscent of episode one; too much CGI\\, pointless characters\\, and sideplots that went nowhere.\\n\\nWhile the franchise is not dead per se\\, it is badly wounded. If they had cut out the Canto bight sequence and eliminated the Poe mutiny sideplot then this would've been a much better movie and at 2 1\/2 hours a much shorter movie.","true":true}
