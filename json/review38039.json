Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The story and plot made no sense what so ever. They changed not only the characters from the pats movies but they changed how the ships and the force works. It is a total waste of time and this will go down as killing the saga.","true":true}
