Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie took hot garbage to a whole new level. I have idolized the star wars legacy since I can remember\\, and this movie completely disgraced me and many other star wars fans. This movie was way worse than the Christmas special. I wish I could meet everyone who contributed to the entire design of this movie so I could at least get a better understanding on why this movie turned out so rancid\\, disgusting\\, and terrible.","true":true}
