Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Diehard Star Wars fan here\\, and I have to agree with the rest of the folks... It was pretty bad. I don't have anything new to add\\, other than it just didn't \\\"feel\\\" like what a Star Wars movie should be. And the sheer amount of tonally wrong humor\\, irrelevant subplots\\, and gaping plot holes just ruined it for me.\\n\\nI don't have the slightest idea why critics seem to like this movie. If it wasn't \\\"Star Wars\\\" and strictly some other film\\, it would be universally panned.\\n\\nI hope that Episode IX can be salvaged. So sad.","true":true}
