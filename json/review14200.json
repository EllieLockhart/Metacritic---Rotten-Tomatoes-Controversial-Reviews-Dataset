Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I genuinely liked this movie. I feel like the people who don't like it are the hard line star wars fanatics who would be irritated by a film taking a different narrative path from the previous second films in the saga and the Tumblr shippers angry that StormPilot wasn't a thing. However\\, as someone who just enjoys the movies and the characters\\, I thought this film showed some very interesting character growth and plot twists that I didn't expect. It wasn't an all around incredible film as I thought it was about half an hour too long\\, but I give it a very solid 7\/10. I think most of the negative reviews on this site now are from bots that some haters have made as they all say similar\\, unenlightened things. ","true":true}
