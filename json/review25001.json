Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My personal review... I'll try to keep it brief and easy to interpret: disappointing; initially boring and slow; long; humor and humor that does not work; no comparison to Force Awakens; Missing J.J.Abrams touch;  poor casting for a few key actors (L.Dern); poor use\/portrayal of Carrie & Mark;  bad storyline\/plot... The good: actors playing Rey and Kylo Ren .  The movie did not work for me... let's hope IX saves the trilogy.","true":true}
