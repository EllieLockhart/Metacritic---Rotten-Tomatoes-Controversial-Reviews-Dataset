Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely terrible. I would understand why critics and your average movie goer would enjoy this garbage fire. I mean\\, it is pretty\\, it has a lot of drama\\, action\\, and some humor. So what's wrong with it?\\n\\n It's not Star Wars. All characterization the characters received in TFA has gone down the drain and have been replaced by Rian's personal vision of these characters. Poe\\, Finn\\, and Rose\\, the most interesting part of this movie\\, but were sidelined instead for shitty and lengthy scenes of Rey and Kylo nonsense. \\n\\nAnd there were SO MANY climaxes\\, the movie feels like it's on cocaine. Go watch any previous SW movie\\, even the prequels\\, they had a basic story structure with a beginning\\, rising action\\, climax\\, falling action\\, and conclusion. But in this garbage fire of a movie it starts with an epic battle\\, moves on to another battle\\, and another action sequence\\, and another\\, and another until you're exhausted and just want to go home. \\n\\nAlso as previously mentioned\\, TLJ features a lot more comedy than previous Star Wars movies. This could be a good thing\\, but any attempt at humor falls flat on it's face. Even when it is a bit funny\\, it ruins the tone of drama. You can't have serious scenes and a light joke and then go back to the drama it doesn't work like that has Rian even gone to film school?\\n\\nHonestly\\, this whole movie is only enjoyable if you don't give a shit about Star Wars and you are only watching it for 2 hours and then going to forget about it. If you are a big Star Wars fan\\, and you try to actually understand what the hell is going on and try to ponder what the hell happened after the credits roll\\, you're going to hurt yourself. \\n\\nAnd I know I have mentioned this before but I can't get over it; ALL the characters have been butchered to a million pieces and then stitched back together into the image that Rian wanted. Perhaps the biggest victim of Rian's butchering of characters was Luke Skywalker\\, everyone's favourite kindhearted and brave hero who saved the most evil man in the galaxy from darkness. Yeah\\, well guess what? He is now a bitter\\, depressed\\, and cynical old man who tried to kill his nephew and apprentice because he sensed a little darkness in him. Just\\, no. Even if it was for a second\\, that is not Luke\\, yet alone Wise Old Jedi Master Luke.\\n\\nThis movie is a mess\\, and does not deserve your money. I would compare it to a fanfiction but that would be an insult to all the dedicated Star Wars writers out there who actually understand the characters and lore and good dialogue and good storytelling. This is more like that shitty Reylo fanfiction written on fanfiction.net by a horny middle aged mom.\\n\\nAlso even as a gay man\\, I DID NOT need to see Adam Driver's disgusting sweaty man child body and nips. No thank you Rian.","true":true}
