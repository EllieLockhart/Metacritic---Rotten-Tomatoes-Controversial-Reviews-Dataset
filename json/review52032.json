{"101487":99827,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After growing up watching the Star Wars saga over and over to the ownership of most of the toys and spending hours pretending to have lightsaber battles with friends\\, you could say that I am a huge Star Wars fan. I approached the Force Awakens with an open mind\\, eager excitement for what would hold in the new saga story. The Force Awakens I enjoyed a lot\\, yes it is very similar in story to ANH but to see the old faces interaction with the team of new comers was something that most fans had hoped for for decades. It was with the same excitement (perhaps even more) that I approached the arrival of The Last Jedi. Over the past few months I have tried to stay away from Spoilers\\, Trailers and generally anything that may give away details of the film\\, I didn't want to find out any deaths or plots (Unlike finding out about Han before watching TFA). So when it came time to take my seat in the Cinema I had little idea what to expect! \\nTo say that after watching the film I was left utterly disappointed\\, is some what  of an understatement! The opening scene alone felt as though I was watching a follow up to Space Balls the movie\\, I was expecting Yoghurt to come flying in with Barf to battle Dark Helmet. The comedy is forced and wholly out of place if not very childish\\, there is no menace in the villains and the heroes are as wet as they come\\, no charm and certainly nothing in them makes you want to cheer them on.\\nI understand that some fans are upset with the way that the original saga was treated in this film\\, not least in the way that Luke Skywalker has been portrayed. The biggest problem for me is that the whole movie seems to revolve around an incredibly ridiculous plot of a space chase that could have been over with in a matter of minutes\\, the whole outside of blaster range is probably the biggest cop out in the history of movie making\\, it seems the director wanted you to forget about the previous grand space battles that have been in Star Wars movies and hoped that none of us would remember that the First Order has Squadrons of fighters that would have ended the chase in minutes! Tractor Beam anyone???\\nPlot holes are abound in the film and that isn't the worst part.\\nIt seems that everything that was set up in TFA was forgotten\\, Finn is shoe horned in with an incredibly stupid side mission just for the sake of him being there\\, they go to find somebody that is one of only a handful of people known in the galaxy to be able to crack the security on the Dreadnought\\, only to stumble upon another character that just so happens to be able to aswell\\, what are the odds!!! Snoke is built up in TFA only to be treated as an afterthought\\, built up as the next big baddie only to be bested in the most pathetic way by a petulant teenager who's strops and mood swings only are only rivaled by Harry Enfields Kevin\\, Reys parents again built up and teased\\, then bang nothing. It is as though the Rian Johnson wanted to mess this up so badly as to make things almost impossible for JJ to sort in episode 9. \\nI could go on and on but all in all I found this to be a massive let down\\, and  after reading some of the reviews left by the critics\\, I am beginning to wonder if they have seen the same film that was released to the general public?","true":true}
