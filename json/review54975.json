Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've loved Star Wars since I was a little kid growing up\\, but left the theater stunned at how much I hated The Last Jedi.  While there were some excellent call backs to the old movies and good action sequences\\, I hated the direction Rian Johnson took the story.   I can't believe Kathleen Kennedy and Disney allowed him to do it.  No true Star Wars fan would have written that.  Sad is all I can say.","true":true}
