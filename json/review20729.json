Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I walked out of this abomination of a film.  The Star Wars saga is dead\\, and Disney killed it.  This film may have been worse than the prequels.  Once the critics realize that the fans won't support this film they'll change their tune.  Expect the critics' 93% fresh rating to plummet rapidly. Disney should cancel the third installment\\, they won't because it will make money\\, of course\\, but it would be the morally right thing to do.","true":true}
