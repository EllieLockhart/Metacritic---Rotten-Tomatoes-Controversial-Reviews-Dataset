Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is not a perfect movie \\, it has some fllawed .But overall it is a really good movie .The sad thing is people hate it when they try something new in star wars movie \\, they hate the 2017 humour \\, they hate when there is some new trick with the force \\, they hate when that Luke is not the hero they tought he was . What i'm trying to say is \\, nobody hate starwars more then star wars fan .","true":true}
