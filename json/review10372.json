Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great movie.  The haters are trolling this site with low reviews.  Not sure what the agenda there is\\, but who cares.  Luke Skywalker's story alone was worth the admission price.  The Rey\/Kylo Ren dynamic element was awesome.  Highly recommended.","true":true}
