Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a mess!  Makes no sense and gives you characters you could care less about.  Destroys the characters you do care about.  Forget about it being a bad Star Wars movie.  It is a bad movie period.  I have no idea what the \\\"critics\\\" are thinking.  I spent most of my time looking at the walls and ceiling of the theater.  \\n\\nI waited in line to see the first in the 70's and have always been a fan but not obsessed with the franchise.  Avoid this one at all cost.","true":true}
