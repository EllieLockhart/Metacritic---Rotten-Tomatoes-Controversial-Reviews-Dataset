Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a godawful wretched movie. It gave me cancer and AIDS simultaneously. I have to question the integrity and honor of anyone who actually enjoyed this heinous film. It is a blight upon the eyes and an abomination upon the soul. Brooding and awkwardly humorous\\, it's most egregious sin is being incessantly BORING. Don't drink the Kool-Aid\\, its full of soy.","true":true}
