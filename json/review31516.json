Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Somewhat entertaining\\, overall disappointing. I grew up with Star Wars\\, and there were parts of this movie that just ruined it. This movie had a lot of potential with the actors and too many opportunities lost. It seems as though they didn't take the time and put forth the  effort to get the script right and make it what it could have been.","true":true}
