Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a thoroughly entertaining film with rich character development and unusually resonant themes. The biggest problem the film has is pacing; the first half drags\\, and the second half is a mess of ideas\\, cutting back and forth between different scenes and failing to connect certain plot threads and ideas. Also\\, as a sequel to The Force Awakens\\, it contradicts almost everything about its predecessor in terms of tone\\, themes\\, and overall direction\\, and casually tosses out plot points that were considered important two years ago. Still\\, this is a gorgeously shot film (despite the occasional prequel-esque CGI and green screen) with breathtaking frames\\, and powerful performances from its core cast\\, especially Mark Hamill\\, Carrie Fisher\\, Adam Driver\\, and Daisy Ridley. It also benefits from the addition of a few new characters\\, expands this universe and our knowledge of the force\\, and complicates the previously established lines between good and evil. Overall\\, it is an entertaining experience\\, but it does make some odd choices\\, and leaves one with many questions\\, first and foremost being: \\\"What did I just watch?\\\"","true":true}
