Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think some of this score is the result of butthurt among those who are mad that fascism isn't celebrated (as if it ever was in SW) and female characters actually play important roles (like that's new in SW either). There is probably some issue with those who didn't get their pet theories validated\\, too\\, which is a product of a bunch of expectations that no film could satisfy. \\n\\nThe whole \\\"Mary Sue\\\" complaint carried over from TFA is a bit ridiculous because I don't ever remember this being an issue with Anakin Skywalker. Why him\\, huh? When did he get to be this ace pilot or how did he built robots as a slave child? Rey is older and had to become basically a bad ass to survive alone. She didn't get limited by an owner so she could learn what she needed and wanted to understand if it helped her. The Force may have helped her\\, too\\, without her realizing it.\\n\\nAnyway\\, I found the run time not overly long. The pacing made me forget all about it\\, even during the Finn\/Rose sequence. That's when I started wondering if some critics were being hypercritical. Finn and Poe learned valuable lessons that will help their future contributions. That was significant and easily conveyed\\, if Holdo's determination not to tell Poe her plan a legitimate concern.\\n\\nRey learned things. too\\, and we may not appreciate them fully\\, given they relate to things hidden until IX is out. Given things Lucas has about the nature of archetypes and his space opera\\, I doubt Reylo is done. \\n\\nMy main initial complaint concerned what Mark Hamill said about Luke Skywalkers' story arc. He isn't the same Jedi. He learned why the Jedi cannot balance the Force by themselves and his new wisdom AND his deep regret over Kylo\/Ben fueled what he did. If one can accept that backstory\\, Hamill gives a fantastic performance and it should be savored. (Indeed\\, the film is well acted top to bottom.) From those lessons\\, however painful\\, he goes out in an epic way like a hero -- and on his own terms. That worked incredibly well.\\n\\nI refused to see VII because I knew they'd kill off Han Solo at Harrison Ford's insistence and I didn't want to watch. So I had little invested in what occurred in VIII and enjoyed it on its own terms\\, despite whatever flaws are there or my concern going in. You can and should as well.","true":true}
