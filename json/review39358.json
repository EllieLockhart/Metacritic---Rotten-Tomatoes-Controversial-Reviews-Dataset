Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is enjoyable\\, but for me that's it. It felt like a long tv episode for some reason\\, as if the action was taking place only during one long day. But other than that there were a few scenes of absolute brilliant directing that a wish had been present through out the whole film\\, because they did stand out from the rest of a 'meh' movie.\\nOh and about Mark Hamill's comments about this franchise\\, I could not agree more.\\nWant I want to say is that I wish that there were more memorable movies made\\, not money making products. The original Star Wars\\, and even the prequels are movies that I can rewatch multiple times and still enjoy them\\, but this is just something that I can only watch a couple of times at most.\\nI hope they bring back George Lucas's as an advisor and they substitute Kathleen Kennedy for someone else\\, because boy are they distancing themselves from Star Wars.","true":true}
