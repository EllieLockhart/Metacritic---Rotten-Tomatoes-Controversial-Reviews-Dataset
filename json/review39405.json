Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is quickly - and I'm pretty sure\\, unintentionally so - turning into the most underrated Star Wars movie yet. Not that it's the best one in the franchise - nothing will top the original trilogy - but it's not that far from that. Seems like people criticise it for not going the way they thought it would go\\, when their main complain with the previous episode was how predictable and familiar it was. This film challenges the characters and puts some short of end to the Skywalker saga\\, but not entirely. After all\\, there is one more chapter left for this sequel trilogy to come to an end\\, but people are already saying this film has ruined Star Wars forever. Sure\\, it's unlike any movie in this universe\\, but that doesn't change the fact that it's a well made and entertaining movie that has its flaws\\, of course - every movie does - but still is a significant improvement over the disappointment that the prequel trilogy was.","true":true}
