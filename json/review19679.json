Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a good movie. It has many issues\\, and some scenes that were kind of painful to watch. But like Rogue One\\, the final product is good.  Many people are angry about the changes\\, or how they make some expectations about what was going to happen\\, and honestly I loved that many of that expectations were destroyed. It was bold in a way\\, and I can respect that. I liked that this one was one of the few Star Wars movies with and specific message\\, that being \\\"hope can come from anywhere\\, and legends aren't what they seem.\\\" And it was delivered even in the plot twists. \\nReally cool.","true":true}
