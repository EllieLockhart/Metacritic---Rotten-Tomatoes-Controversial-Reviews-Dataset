Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nitpicking and straight up political bias are where the majority of the bad reviews are coming from. This is a great movie with a fresh and original story. Rey is fantastic and Kylo is growing on me as a complex character torn between light and dark. Ignore the haters and enjoy the movie.","true":true}
