Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Leia fly? Luke trying to kill his own nephew after what he did with his father? When you step into the dark side there is no coming back\\, they made 6 movies for the one who could do that\\, Vader\\, through his son Luke\\, and here\\, kylo is always crying \\\"I am good? aI am bad? boy\\, you killed your own father apart from many other people\\, you should have at least dark side eyes\\, is impossible being struggling at this point. Rey is a flat character\\, like I didnt saw in many time\\, its true. Half of the movie was senseless for the plot\\, and the other half an insult to the previous work. It doenst really exist to me\\, star wars ended in Ep. VI","true":true}
