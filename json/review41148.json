Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has it's strengths as well as it's flaws. However\\, I feel a majority of the risks that they took paid off in full for the series. If you are merely judging this film because it's owned by Disney\\, then you have no place in reviewing this movie.","true":true}
