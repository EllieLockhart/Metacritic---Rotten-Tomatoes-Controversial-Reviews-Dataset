Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Biggest disappointment of 2017. I liked TFA although it was a rehash of EpIV. It was well timed\\, made and very entertaining. TLJ was dull\\, parody-like humor was ill placed\\, story boring\\, music lame\\, set design (throne room) looked like a TV stage. Please blow it to hell and remake EpVIII (wo?t happen).","true":true}
