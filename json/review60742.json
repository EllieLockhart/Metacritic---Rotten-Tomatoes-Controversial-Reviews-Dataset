Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I\u2019m a huge naughty dog fan so this one hurts but it needs to be written. The original was a masterpiece so I could not wait for a sequel. 7 long years later and finally it\u2019s here. The game is visually stunning\\, the gameplay is similar to the original with a few new additions and a few items have been removed. The major issue with this game is the story. I feel as gamers that we develop a relationship with the main characters that is far more deep and complex than that of characters in a movie. As a grown man I feel that it is in our DNA to want to look after and protect the people in our lives and we fully experienced the ups and downs of doing this in part 1 when playing as Joel. They have taken that from us. Wesley on we witness one of our favourite game characters being beaten to death with a golf club. After everything we went through we wait 7 years for this! The enthusiasm to play the game instantly drains from the player. We\u2019re then forced to play as the person that murdered our favourite character. We do not want to play as this person. We want them dead\\, erased from history like this sequel never happened. The series is ruined. There will be zero interest in a 3rd title and I\u2019ll have serious doubts about ever buying a naughty dog game again that from us\u2026 Expand","true":true}
