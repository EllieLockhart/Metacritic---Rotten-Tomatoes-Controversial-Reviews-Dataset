Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One thing I don't like about this site. The audience score is based off of what? A bunch of teens or people who never watch SW? Well anyways\\, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. \\nIt was one of the best SW movies in my opinion. It's amazing now that you have these directors who grew up on the original three. They have stated this and it has been to date a great ride because these directors capture the same aura as the original. Growing up I loved SW I was a child when they came out but I still watched them and that feeling watching those movies for the first time was fun and I wanted more. I get the same feeling watching these new SW movies. TFA and TLJ are terrific movies and don't let the audience rating deter you from seeing this movie. Rian Johnson did an amazing job on this movie. Highly recommended.","true":true}
