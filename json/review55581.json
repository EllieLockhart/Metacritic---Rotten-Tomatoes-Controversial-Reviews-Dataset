Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not as good as Episode VII.  Why do a few of the episodes insist on going all comedy?  This dilutes the back story.  I still do not like the actor playing Finn.  Especially when he goes from being some lowly grunt to being able to take on a Master Stormtrooper is just a short time.  Also\\, how does a pipe worker on a cruiser essentially become a fighter pilot?  I like droid antics but BB8 at the beginning went too comedic.  So now Kylo is some 2nd rate Sith Lord\\, despite years of training and combat use?  Looked like Hamil did not even want to be in the movie\\, just have just CGI'd him if that were the case.  And now I guess Leia is a Master Jedi by her ability to survive in space and pull herself back to the ship.  In all the episodes this is the most power she has ever displayed.  Ridiculous.  Also\\, generals with a history of tremendous battle experience now where evening gowns?  I liked her twist at the end but the Rebels were under serious attack and half the leaders wear formal wear?  How Social Justice warriory for the casino bit.  I get the final underlying plot of it but there was so much time spent on the external display that it drowned out the real meaning.  Bad form.","true":true}
