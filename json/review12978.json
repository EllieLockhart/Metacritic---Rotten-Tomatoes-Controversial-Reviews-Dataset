Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I dont care about Lucas\u00b4s Canon\\, so i am able to see the movie as what it really is .... an AWESOME movie that i deeply enjoyed. Lucas and his rabid fans should just let go.... He sold the franchise for 4000 Million Bucks.... well.... enjoy the money and STFU..... He sold a dear son..... He is the traitor \\, NOT Disney.","true":true}
