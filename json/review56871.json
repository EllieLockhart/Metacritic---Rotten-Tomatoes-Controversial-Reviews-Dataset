Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is zero honor of star wars legacy! All that we know from Star Wars has be killed by Disney\\, except R2D2\\, C3PO\\, Chewie & the Falcon\\, but I dont expect them to last the sequels. The Force is ridiculed and no longer anything telating to teachings of all previous movies. The Jedi all gone and their concepts that lasted thousands of years were laughed at and pissed on\\, oh maybe burned by ghost weather\\, whatever. Original hero's now all pathetic losers who end with meaningless deaths. Basically\\, anything you liked about Star Wars over the past 40 years will be ripped out of you by this movie. What remains is Disney junk\\, at best a 2 hour+ advert for selling merchandise to kids. Nothing more to believe in\\, the 'past died' as indicated in these comedy films on several occasions\\, the future has nothing but extreme-action tales of single-movie characters with dull stories that have no sense. Star Wars has died\\, fact. It is morally wrong that Disney are able to label these new films as 'Star Wars' when they have no regard to anything Lucasfilm created nor care for anything that made the Saga so popular for decades. #Notmystarwars","true":true}
