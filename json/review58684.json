To everyone who is complaining that essentially \\\"elly is a woman\\\" with progressively stupider lines of rationale especially those who complain about the desexualization of her appearance\\, go F yourselves. This is an incredible game with some of the best graphics I have ever seen. The lighting alone would get it to 5 stars especially in comparison with what is on the market in all other spheres. The gameplay is improved from the first game and in all ways it continues the tradition of being a masterful storytelling experience with a world colored as you walk through it. Yes\\, there is one early event which could have been done differently. However\\, this does not detract from the rest of the game. If you enjoy stealth games and the Last of Us\\, there is no reason that you cannot enjoy the Last of Us 2 full stop unless you are ostensibly a sexist pile of trash. I feel very strongly about this being a male who honestly does not give a **** which gender a character is as long as their story is intriguing.\r\rThank you naughty dog for an incredible game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
