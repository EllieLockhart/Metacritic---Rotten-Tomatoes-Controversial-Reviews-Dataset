Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While it at times leans heavily on plot points that we've seen many times in Star Wars\\, the motivations behind character actions and the thoroughly developed character arcs help escalate the second installment of this new trilogy far above The Force Awakens\\, which was essentially a reboot of A New Hope. Everything you liked about Episode VII takes a darker tone and almost everything that was a bit cliche gets thrown out. An almost perfect meld of old and new that refocuses the story on what will hopefully be a completely original conclusion in Episode IX. Plus the visuals are mind-blowingly impressive and serve as much more than spectacle. Where some of the dialogue suffers\\, the emotion and ingenuity\\, brought by the perfect cast and director Rian Johnson respectively\\, succeed in brilliant fashion.","true":true}
