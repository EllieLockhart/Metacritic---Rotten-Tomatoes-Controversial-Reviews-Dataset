Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Short and sweet review: Star Wars to me has always been the perfect blend of action\\, adventure and romance. The action was almost nothing but redundant space battles. The adventure was a 10 minute clunker on Canto with Finn and Rose. The romance was non existent. Disappointing film :( ","true":true}
