Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I honestly think that the reason this episode is getting sooo much hate. Is because of everyone\u2019s personal theories leading into this episode got thrown out the window. I personally as a diehard Star Wars and Empire fan think this episode is my favorite because of the risks they took with the lore and how beautiful some scenes were. Now yes there were dull moments but not enough or that bad for me to HATE this episode. Now I understand why people dislike it but you cannot sit there and tell me this is worse than Phantom Menace.","true":true}
