Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(SPOILERS) It was alright. Probably not the best place to start experimenting though. The main problems for me were the overused jokes\\, weird character motivations\\, and the Finn\/Rose subplot. I loved everything with Rey\\, Luke\\, and Kylo. Killing Snoke off was an odd decision\\, but it doesn't anger me and I'm also not totally convinced he's really dead. The stuff with Holdo and Poe was kinda lame. This film is filled with great stuff\\, average stuff\\, and terrible stuff\\, and they all kinda cancel each other out and make this film disappointingly average. I personally feel the good outweighs the bad in this movie\\, but i can see why some people might get so hung up about it. Overall\\, not too bad\\, a lot of cool stuff\\, and I hope Rose is dead. I actually wrote a much more in-depth analysis of this movie here\\, but I accidentally deleted it\\, so now you have this. Anyway\\, good things: Rey and Kylo's connection\\, Luke projecting himself across the galaxy\\, Yoda coming back\\, and Holdo ramming her ship through the First Order's ship at light speed. To be honest\\, the most disappointing thing about this movie to me is how little we saw Luke's green lightsaber. I don't know why\\, but I love that thing. In conclusion\\, worse than the originals\\, better than the prequels\\, worse than the criics are claiming\\, better than a lot of the fans are claiming. Could have been better\\, but it could have been worse. There's a comic book adaptation of this movie that has some small changes that really do wonders\\, so I recommend that you check that out and pretend it's what we saw in theaters.","true":true}
