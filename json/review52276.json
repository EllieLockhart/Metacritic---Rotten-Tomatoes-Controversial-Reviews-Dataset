Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A genuinely bad film.  Outside of Adam Driver's Kylo Ren\\, the acting is middling; the story is meandering and boring\\, and spends most of its time just spinning its wheels in between boring action set pieces.  The FX are surprisingly bad\\, the new characters are uninspiring\\, and the great characters developed in the previous film become bores this time around.  The humor is misplaced and unfunny\\, instead of wry and well-executed like previous SW entries.  A lot of the audience is negatively reacting to directional choices for the characters (Ala making Luke a bitter hermit) but those are not the problem.  The problem is in the execution\\, which is so bad it makes the rehashed story and uninspired characters standout\\, in complete contrast to The Force Awakens.","true":true}
