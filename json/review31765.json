Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sound and fury\\, taking the \\\"saga of skywalker\\\" and literally throwing it off the cliff.   The script reads like something written by a junior high schooler\\, and the 'rules of the universe' are just ignored for convenience.  Give it a pass.  It's worse than \\\"force awakens\\\"\\, which is saying quite a lot. (Or a little.)","true":true}
