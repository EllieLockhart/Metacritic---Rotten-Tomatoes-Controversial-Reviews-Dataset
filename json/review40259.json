Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This isn't a star wars film this is a Disney cash grab. Everything thing that was hyped and questions you wanted answers for throw those thoughts of the window. \\nThe mystery of Luke\\, The mystery of Snoke\\, Rey's parents\\, Rey's training\\, the resistance\\, and more are all answered but is stupid ways that spit straight into the audiences face. Not to mention Jar Jar Binks has a better character ark and more interesting story then Fynn and Poe does this movie\\, completely uses and unneeded. The only redeeming factor was the acting\\, the actors were great\\, if only Micky didn't molest the hell out the of this movies to turn a cheep profit.","true":true}
