Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had so much potential but over complicated a simple plot. I believe all fan theories of Rey's and Snoke's backstory being disguarded were supposed to be \\\"gotcha\\\" moments instead of enriching the storyline. Subsequently non-sensical plots ruined what could have been a great movie.","true":true}
