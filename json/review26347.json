Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not to spoil anything but this movie is so bad I'd rather be kicked in the testicles as hard as one can than see this TRASH ever again.\\n\\nFrom now on in my household if it is not movies 1 through 6\\, the original Star Wars Battlefront games on pap\\, ps2\\, xb and pc along with kotor 1 and 2 than It is not allowed to be refranced or even spoke of at all.","true":true}
