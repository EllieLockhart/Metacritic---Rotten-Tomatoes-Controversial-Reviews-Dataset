Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you are going into this movie\\, with the goosebumps on your arms as the beginning credits roll out then you are in luck. The movie retains that presence until the beginning scene happens then the ever-growing shit of Disney and Rian James commences. \\n\\nStars Wars for me was a thing that my father raised me on\\, with watching the movies as a young boy and buying the toy lightsabers. Hell\\, remembering the time of being Darth Maul for Halloween when I was 5 or 6 was just a treat. The movies in the past seemed to have the glory it so well achieved. \\n\\nI will state\\, that Episode 7: The Force Awakens was a great testament to Disney showing that they could take the reigns of Star Wars (with a little guidance from George Lucas). Then Episode 8: The Last Jedi comes to light\\, as being a testament to how Disney ruins a legacy. \\n\\nThe movie was predictable at every turn. Words from my father stated that \\\"If Kylo ended up saying to Rey that we are siblings\\, I would have walked out from this film.\\\". To anyone who desires to see this film and has no recollection of past Star Wars films then go for it. However\\, to those who find the idea of the Jedi\\, what Luke\\, Leia\\, and Han used to be I urge you this movie destroys those ideas. \\n\\nI have no idea whether Episode 9 will be the end of the franchise\\, it better be.","true":true}
