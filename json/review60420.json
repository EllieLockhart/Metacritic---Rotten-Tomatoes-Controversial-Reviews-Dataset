Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"One of the best games I have played. It feels like playing through a novel\\, which means you have less autonomy over the characters\u2019 actions. You get to experience the characters as they are written\\, which is as flawed human beings. This makes it a more passive player experience\\, which I liked! It was different. I have never been forced to play as a character that I absolutely despised. It was a new feeling and I thought it was brilliant. By the end of Abby\u2019s storyline I didn\u2019t hate her anymore. I didn\u2019t love her either\\, but I was able to see her more as a whole human being. What an achievement. I felt like the game was sort of a commentary on the political climate in America where we live in extremes politically. We \u201cother\u201d differing point of views to the extent that we no longer see them as fully human. This game forces you to see Abby and others as whole human beings. Art imitates life here\\, and that\u2019s a harsh reality to face. No person is 100% good or bad. We are all a mix of good and bad and we all do dumb stuff\/ make bad choices sometimes. It\u2019s a game that teaches empathy and does require some emotional intelligence\/ maturity. If you don\u2019t understand the ending then I feel like maybe you\u2019re not mature enough to play the game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
