Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This might be the worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen.  Completely underdeveloped characters humor that did not work and just a very weak story\\, oh and let's not forget the pointless things just thrown in for Disney to sell stuff..Everyone will need the secret Rebel Decoder ring for Christmas now.  I waited 2 years to find out about Snoke! and what I found out was nothing.","true":true}
