Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a horrid movie. It insulted fans on many levels. It shows Disney does not know what Star Wars is. There was no understanding of even the previous movie. How do they make a sequel that does not even connect to the movie it is supposed to follow. Every open-ended plot JJ left RJ made fun of dismissed or used as a way to tell the fans he was laughing at us. JJ may have done poorly\\, but He at least showed love to the fans. RJ flipped us off then lies to our face saying he is a fan.","true":true}
