Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While not a perfect film\\, it's a pretty great film standing on its own as well as marrying into the long standing and revered franchise\\, so as a long time Star Wars fan\\, I was surprised at the backlash it was getting from fellow fans.  To my mind\\, this film continues the evolvement that Rogue One began.  We live in darker times than we did (believe it or not) when a little space western called Star Wars came out 40 years ago\\, and the newer films reflect that.  They're brutal in some respects.  The leads are more complex:  there may be a light and a dark side to the Force\\, but the fact that both live within all of us - not just Vader - is taken out of the box and examined more readily than before.  That said\\, those darker themes that ripple throughout were too starkly contrasted by the moments of humor in the film.  Porgs are adorable\\,  but really had no purpose.  And a few other moments seemed out of character for the film overall.  My daughter dubbed them \\\"Disney moments\\\".  But it didn't diminish for me what was really happening here.  As the director did in Loopers\\, he took a rousing sci fi action flick and managed to examine the power of familial love with it.  Just as there is in Kylo Rens' mind\\, there's a lot going on here.  Clear your mind\\, use the Force and try to see what it's truly putting out there.  And then enjoy the light saber sequences!","true":true}
