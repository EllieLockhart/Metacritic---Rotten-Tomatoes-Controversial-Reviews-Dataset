Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My initial review of TLJ was the first i have written on this site. I have since been led to believe that my initial review for this film that gave it half a star is not counted; in order for it to be i have written this and given it 1 star.\\n\\nEven the good actors in the cast could not save this script as it gave them very little to work with\\, characters get very little grounding\\, building or development. The script is also laden with plot holes; events happen with no real grounding in the story and on several occasions deus ex machina events break the logic of the preceding films  and also \\nbreak the internal logic of this film in itself.\\n\\nSome of the best CGI work i have ever seen reinforces what a wasted opportunity this was\\, huge resources and talent which could have made this the best SW film yet instead delivered porgs and BB8 firing coins like a slot machine; thinking about the movie now makes me angry.","true":true}
