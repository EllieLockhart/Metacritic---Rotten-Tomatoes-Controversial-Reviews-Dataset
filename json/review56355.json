Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie. Gets 1 star for impressive CGI. The plot\\, subplots\\, side characters (Finn and Rose) are absolutely atrocious. On top of that\\, continuous forced\/campy humor serve to take away from an already weak plot. Rogue One was infinitely better.","true":true}
