Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unreal\\, to destroy Luke and have so many wacky plots and characters.  What an epic failure.  I DID NOT pay to see this and will NOT support Disney's view point and crap writing..","true":true}
