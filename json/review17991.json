Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think that sometimes reviewers see so many movies that when a good one comes along they can go overboard\\, while a lot of us go to see Star Wars and not that much else. This was good but not great - (Spoilers now in play) Leia's returning to the ship!? Whole casino sequence?! Rey in the dark hole very underwhelming\\, an opportunity missed\\, Admiral Holdo takes ten minutes and ten pods to turn the ship around. Biggest clunk - \\\"God Speed\\\" Is this the first mention of God in Star Wars - if so it shouldn't be there - both my kids noticed and felt it was completely wrong. \\nBUT - great humour\\, some good surprises\\, great light sabre fights\\, good acting(Mark Hammil was brilliant)\\, good flying. Good addition to the pantheon\\, but not as great as someare claiming.","true":true}
