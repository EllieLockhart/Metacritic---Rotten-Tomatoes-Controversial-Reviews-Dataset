Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie ruined my childhood memories by polluting it with a terrible 'I don't care attitude.'  The SJW messages throughout the terrible plot and poor character development.  I'm so disenchanted with the way the franchise is going.","true":true}
