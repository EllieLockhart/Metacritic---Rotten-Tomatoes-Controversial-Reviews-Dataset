Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers : there is a scene where Fin uses the word \\\"COPS\\\" Since when was the Star Wars universe using Earth English Slag? There's not much I can write that hasn't already been written. I would rather watch the crappy prequels instead of this movie. It doesn't feel like star wars. It's anti-starwars. I watched Force Awakens at least twice in the theatre. I really enjoyed that movie. I was not bothered by a powerful lead female. I really enjoyed that Fin was a black storm tripper with the heart of gold. I have a problem with The Last Jedi because it's a terrible movie.  I will never pay to watch another Disney Star Wars movie again. Rip Star Wars.","true":true}
