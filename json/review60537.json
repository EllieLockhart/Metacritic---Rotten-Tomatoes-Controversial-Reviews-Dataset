I recommend being prepared to let go of expectations\\, and not focusing on what you think is a story with a moral. The story is meant to be challenging and ugly\\, and at times downright depressing.

Towards the end\\, I felt like **** and wanted the game to end a few hours earlier. But I'm not even mad - IIn retrospect\\, I enjoyed the grueling last few hours.\r\rMy only complaints are that the game mechanic of searching every corner of the level after killing everyone somewhat breaks the pace\\, and at times it is incredibly frustrating to be searching for a safe code and accidentally go past that level's point of no return\\, causing you to save before every door out of fear of having to redo the chapter. These both break the immersion\\, but not enough to remove more than 1 point from my score.\r\rThere is also the occasional bug (e.g. reloading levels changes items\\, and sometimes I was shot into space or stuck in walls). No big deal.\r\rDo yourself a favor and play this game and explore the way you feel while doing it. Even if you are upset about certain beats in the story. It is only a story\\, and if you pay attention\\, it takes you to interesting places.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
