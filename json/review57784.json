Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning but it's a Star Wars film so it supposed to be. The hyperspace scene and the throne roomm scene are the only good things about this flick I will remember. All the toys I got my kid for Christmas from this movie are getting unwrapped and returned. Thought people who ragged on Disney were not giving them a fair shake at first and I defended TFW but this is a Franchise killer. When the plot of your movie is about your ship running out of gas\\, Houston we have a problem. Kathleen Kennedy GOTTA GO for mouse house to have a scapegoat. She's horrible when handling LucasFilm. It time for Dave Filoni and Pablo Hildalgo to assume their rightful place as Georges heir to his Galaxy. Just ranting now. Done","true":true}
