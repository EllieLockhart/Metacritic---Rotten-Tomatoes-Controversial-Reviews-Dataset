Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While it is slow in getting there' Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi mostly succeeds in maturing and complicating the set of young new lead characters we are introduced to in The Force Awakens. There are a few words which come to mind when describing the feel of the film: jarring\\, excruciating\\, depressing. Not exactly the common description of a great film. The Last Jedi not only subverts expectations\\, it annihilates them far beyond the point of divisiveness. In some cases\\, this was a necessary evil in order to eliminate some of the many JJ Abrams mystery boxes that left fans interested but would have hindered the progression of the trilogy's plot in the end. Because of this\\, \\\"Jedi\\\" has granted Episode IX the opportunity to become a truly unique story. Besides the many narrative surprises\\, The Last Jedi is\\, at its heart\\, a story of failure. Nearly every character has a moment where they spectacularly fail in their personal mission. Defeat and humility is rarely fan-friendly\\, but it's refreshing to see in a blockbuster movie\\, especially when many of its contemporaries are too afraid to take moviegoers off of their emotional high. That being said\\, \\\"Jedi\\\" all too often keeps itself from becoming serious when it needs to be\\, injecting a brand of humor obviously inspired by Disney's Marvel movies into poorly-timed moments. Regardless\\, The Last Jedi manages to be possibly the most emotion-driven installment of the franchise\\, as well as the least monochromatic in terms of the divide between the dark and light sides of the Force.\\n\\nThe pacing for the first half of the movie is awkward. After a stellar and poignant opening sequence\\, the First Order and Resistance find themselves at a stalemate. While the scenes between Rey and Luke on Ahch-To are superbly done\\, two other engage in a B-plot that honestly could have been cut from the movie. But once things pick up\\, you are treated to a whirlwind of exhilarating action scenes and emotional drama.\\n\\nThe two standout performances in The Last Jedi come from Adam Driver and Mark Hamill. Driver's Kylo Ren has blossomed into one of the most complex and interesting characters in the history of the saga\\, while Hamill delivers a performance that adds a great new dimension to the classic Luke Skywalker.\\n\\nAs with every Star Wars movie\\, the quality of the cinematography and visual effects need not be questioned. I will add that there is one moment in the film that may go down as the most powerful image in Star Wars history.\\n\\nI must admit that there are several scenes that feel very in-Star Wars\\, whether because of the dialogue used by certain characters or the expanded abilities granted by the Force. However\\, there are just as many scenes that will leave viewers stunned.\\n\\nOverall\\, The Last Jedi shaves off some of the fat that has accumulated from 7 movies worth of lore\\, to the resent of some\\, but also frames the prequels in a new light\\, especially the actions of the old Jedi Council. While clunky at times and filled with a few too many jokes\\, it will truly shock audiences and set the stage for a thrilling conclusion.","true":true}
