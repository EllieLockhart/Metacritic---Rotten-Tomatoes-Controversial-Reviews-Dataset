Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"worst in the star wars franchise I wanted to walk out but stayed hoping there would be a moment when luke would not be utterly useless he died for nothing so stupid","true":true}
