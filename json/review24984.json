Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My non spoiler review is as follows. Go see it! It has action and intensity throughout. It has a lot of great suprises along the way and some of the very best lightsaber and space battles yet. Jedi is dense and there is a lot to unpack so replay value should be great. Best of all the Porgs do not ruin the movie. Essentially it's the Star Wars movie we have been waiting for ever since Return of the Jedi. I'll say it's my second favorite Star Wars movie after The Empire Strikes Back. 5 out of 5 stars.","true":true}
