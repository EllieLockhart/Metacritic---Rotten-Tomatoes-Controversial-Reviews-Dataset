We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"With this game being Part 2 of the Last of Us franchise\\, it has truly brought the story to a beautiful end. The game is designed to make you think and feel emotions on both sides of the story.  The game wants you to know that your actions have consequences. It truly does make you wander if revenge and the actions needed to exact it are truly worth the costs involved. Both Abby and Ellie were completely justified in what they did and this is often the most difficult idea to come to terms with because we ourselves want revenge for the loss of Joel but begin to realise that if the first game was from Abby's perspective\\, we would have felt the exact same way for her and the loss of her father by Joel's hands. This is top notch storytelling. There is also so much to explore and discover and be absolutely amazed by in this game. The world is immaculately designed and takes what we have loved from the first game and expands on it in ways that allow us to appreciate the world we have been thrown into and the work that went behind everything we get to experience. This includes the smooth combat mechanics and even something as simple as the collectibles layered throughout the game and weapon crafting. Altogether\\, the game offers a brilliantly constructed story that achieves what the developers set out to do and gameplay that revolutionises the idea of what you can do within a game. The game and the developers do not deserve the controversy they received\\, but rather deserve absolute praise for what they have achieved.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
