Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not sure why this movie has a high rating. It was the epitome of cliches. The dialogues were the worst I've seen since a Zack Snyder movie - over explained and horribly commonplace. While the filming was good\\, the characters never really reached a relatable arc. I loved the sound engineering though.","true":true}
