Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Personally\\, I would not give this movie a perfect five star rating\\, but because of all the unnecessary sh*t that's going down with this movie\\, I think it's necessary to help improve the audience score. I mean\\, seriously? This is a fine movie. sure some aspects aren't perfect\\, but that seems like the only thing stupid Star Wars fans need these days. Just because one f*cking thing is off with this movie\\, doesn't mean you have to go on a rampage about it! I think that in the end\\, if you weren't nitpicking every aspect of it\\, this is a fun\\, entertaining addition to the Star Wars franchise.","true":true}
