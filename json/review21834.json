Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just got back from watching the movie and was somewhat surprised to see all the negative audience reviews. I quite enjoyed the movie... I agree that the side plot storyline wasn't necessary and dragged the movie down a bit\\, but overall it was a very fun movie.\\n\\nI think where most people have an issue is that they had their own expectations of how Luke would behave\\, and this movie was there to clear the space to allow the new heros to take center stage.\\n\\nI really like how Rian took the movie in a direction that I think most people were not expecting. \\n\\nOverall I think if they would have cut out the side mission I would have given this movie 5 stars\\, otherwise it was still a solid four for me.","true":true}
