Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a bad film\\, almost a very bad film; a very lazy script\\, badly directed. Wastes all the exposition and character development from Force awakens\\, trashes the legacy and future of major characters and basically makes no sense from beginning to end. \\n\\nThe movie burns its credibility in the first 5 minutes with a pathetic attempt at humour and when you get to the Leia Poppins moment about 20 minutes you know you are watching something stinky.\\n\\nHaving said the above there is enough jaw dropping stupidity and illogicality to keep you OMGing to the end and maybe 2 out of 10 set piece sequences work.. but then Rian Johnston burns down the farm after one of them as a big FU to fans. Disney is why we can't have nice things.\\n\\nIt's terrible movie as a piece of film making\\, save your money and re-watch Phantom Menace.","true":true}
