Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not the old Star Wars Trilogy\\, this will not be the old Star Wars Trilogy.. this trilogy will not follow the same plot line strategy of the old Star Wars Trilogy.. so I don't understand why you people are \\\"disappointed\\\" in the fact that this trilogy's plot line is \\\"not like the old one\\\" <-- that's basically the gist I get from reading these audience reviews.... This new Star Wars Trilogy is following a different direction from the old one and I need y'all to stop giving bad reviews because these films don't follow the Star Wars trend you fell in love with 10yrs ago.","true":true}
