Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is like a great soap opera you can watch it a zillion times and some will never get bored \\, is fun\\, enjoyable but yet is like the same story repeating itself differently\\, is at the same time fresh and rusty. It has is awesome moments along with flat ones too\\, I left the room feeling the movie had many loopholes that some of us noticed and some were oblivious about it. Last Jedi is certainly a polarized movie at different levels\\, I am bit surprised that critics gave such an excellent rate\\, perhaps they don't like to criticize or diminish the quality of Disney's work  by some mysterious reasons. I feel that if you want a heroine to be the star of this movie perhaps Disney can consider a female director that would be more in tune with Rey's character like Patty Jenkis did for Wonder Woman.","true":true}
