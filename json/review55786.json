Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Personally\\, I am a Star Wars fan\\, just a fan\\, and  I did not like it\\, but I think it doesn't have to make it a bad movie\\, the special effects are astonishing as ALMOST always\\, but in the other hand\\, there's not much story where to dig up from. It looks like the lack of fuel at the Resistance's fleet is just an excuse to make Finn and Rose together. Benicio del Toro's character had way too much more future and Captain Phasma literally did not do anything different from the last movie. Kylo still looks like a child who never gets what he wants instead of being \\\"The new kind of Vader\\\". And my biggest complaint there was not really a good battle\\, at all.","true":true}
