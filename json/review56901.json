Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The saga's rich legacy is conveniently either forgotten or stripped out by hidden rewrites. The film is more a hodge-podge of poorly sewn together plot holes than a coherent script\\, where characters set up in the previous film (and historically loved) have any pay-off denied them and any concept of character development is forgotten in place of formulaic but nonsensical set piece battles\\, artificially constructed scenarios intended to build tension that largely become comedic\\, blatant toy product placement and a determination not to rock any boats or change the ultimate status quo of the series. Directly after watching I had managed to write down THIRTY glaring and laughable plot holes! If you don't care for\\, haven't really paid much attention to or haven't seen a Star Wars film before then this could be an enjoyable Sci-Fi film in a similar mode to Guardians of the Galaxy but if you have any history with the franchise\\, back story or investments in characters...this is not the film you're looking for. To continue further with this review would lead to a veritable ESSAY highlighting poor script writing\\, potential corporately motivated re-writes and a near obsessive need to milk the franchise and inject spin-off franchise sales.","true":true}
