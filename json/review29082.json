Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really love this movie one of my top 3. The only problem I had was the way they handled Skywalker. I really wanted him to have been involved me. For a guy like me that really loves Star Wars this is really a great and unpredictable movie and I like it. They took risk that ultimately had consequences for many of the viewers that watched this movie. Therefore at the end of the day I would definitely recommend this movie.","true":true}
