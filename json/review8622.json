Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First Star Wars movie in a long time which really dares to renew the franchise. Only major problems are that the last third is too action packed\\, and there is generally too much action packed into it. But it's still all worth it. The last Jedi really dares to suprise the viewer by not taking the safest solution at every turn.","true":true}
