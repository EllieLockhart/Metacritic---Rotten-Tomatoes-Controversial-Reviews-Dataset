Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a great film\\, but not a great Star Wars film. It's well made\\, the acting is great and the effects are awesome. Unlike The Force Awakens\\, it isn't just a remake of its corresponding film in the Original Trilogy; there are sequences that mirror The Empire Strikes Back\\, but it's feels like a new film\\, as opposed to TFA. \\n\\nThat's where the good ends unfortunately. There are a lot of problems with the films narrative. I won't go into excessive details\\, as this is a (mostly) spoiler free review\\, but suffice it to say that many extremely important plot lines from The Force Awakens are just thrown away here. Who is Snoke? Doesn't matter apparently. Who are Rey's parents? Prepare to be disappointed. The Luke plotline is extremely disappointing and character development as a whole is virtually nil. \\n\\nTL;DR: Great acting\\, music\\, effects and battle scenes; really awful narrative.","true":true}
