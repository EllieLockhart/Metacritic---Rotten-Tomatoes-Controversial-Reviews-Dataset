Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was waiting for the feeling.... like when i was a kid back in 1978\\, ...but i only felt it during one scene. When Leia used the force to stay alive in space\\, but the rest of the movie seemed like they lost direction and decided to cut ties with anything from the old franchise in a hasty yet drawn out fashion. Problem is\\, that old legacy is what kept this franchise alive. I loved Rouge 1 because it filled some gaps\\, and answered some questions. I hope that Solo does the same. Would rather watch the origins of the Sith and the Jedi... instead of this new direction.","true":true}
