Admittedly\\, some may be pissed by some of the story arc and the fact that Abby was unnecessarily \\\"de-sexualized\\\" to appease PITA feminists like Anita Sarkeesian\\, but this does not negate how awesome the overall game is. Days Gone (another outstanding game) was unfairly bashed by professional critics for not catering to SJWs. Don't let an even better game suffer because of overblown SJW influence. Hands down\\, this is the best game that I have ever played. Immersive. Beautifully detailed. Lots of jump scares. Hollywood level animation in both cutscenes and gameplay.
