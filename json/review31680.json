Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sorry fanboys. This is the best and most honest story about Star Wars YET! All the super fans who are caught up by the Jedi-Rules have bought the same lines sold to Anakin... and Rian Johnson lays it all out.\\nThe next generation is ready to take the mantle and being BALANCE to the Force!\\nKnitpicking and bro-hurt feelings is not going to change this... space wizards got powers and no one needs to man-splain them to you.\\nWhat is important is the messag about the source of Power and Tyranny... not the \\\"evil wizards\\\" vs. the good ones.","true":true}
