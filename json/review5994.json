{"101487":116090,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing to say the best. This movie kept trying to get somewhere that it just never got to. The last Star Wars movie was pretty good. Rogue One was awesome. This one disappointed. SPOILER: We didn\u2019t wait that long to see Luke Skywalker and have him leave us like that. Wow. The sidebar story with the casino was also a head scratcher. Hopefully JJ Abrahams saves the 3d movie. ","true":true}
