Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The move was great with good subtle things added throughout the movie. Foreshadowing was solid. Proper amount of nostalgia from the past combined with new elements.  There were a couple of things that required you to suspend your disbelief a bit\\, but what movies don't. Far more went right in this movie than what went wrong. I seriously don't get the majority of these negative reviews.","true":true}
