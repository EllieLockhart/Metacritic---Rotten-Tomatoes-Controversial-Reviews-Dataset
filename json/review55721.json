Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One word after this movie\\, horrible.  I was legitamately disturbed and disgusted as this movie (I will be revealing spoilers do if you haven't seen the movie don't read the entire review).  Please\\, if you haven't seen this movie DON'T SUPPORT IT!!! Disney shouldn't make anything off this movie since all it is is a big middle finger to all of the original fans. (SPOILER ALERT) I mean WHY THE HECK DID THEY HAVE TO KILL OFF LUKE??!!  What Emperor did in Ep. VI was way worse and should have caused more harm to him\\, then being a ghost and having your nephew kill you twice and then when it is revealed that he wasn;t really there then HE DIES!!  The directors made it seem as if Luke's death wasn't even a big deal\\, as if he was just some random that was just inroduced in the movie.  In addition to this\\, what the heck is up with Princess Leia somehow being able to travel through space when she has never been taught to use the force? That brings me onto how Rey somehow was able to nearly beat Luke in a one-on-one match when she was only taught 1\/3 lessons Luke was supposed to teach her.. That also brings me onto her parents.  The Force Awakens set so many things up for this movie that were not even mentioned.  I could go on and on with this\\, but DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS HORRIFIC MOVIE\\, AND DON'T SUPPORT DISNEY'S CHOICE FOR THIS MOVIE.","true":true}
