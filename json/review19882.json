Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was breathtaking. Fabulous. Couldn't have asked for better. \\nI see there is a lot of negativity from some fans on this page\\, but I think they are just disappointed in the change and new direction\\, or perhaps things didnt go their way exactly? \\nThe action was incredible\\, so too was the romance\\, mythology\\, and story. Lucas films has not failed to amaze. Im going to see it again!","true":true}
