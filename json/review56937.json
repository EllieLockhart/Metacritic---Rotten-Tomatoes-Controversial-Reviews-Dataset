Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The \\\"surprising\\\" character development (for Luke) is one thing: the cynicism and willingness to let go do not certainly sound like the Skywalker hero we used to know from the classic trilogy. The \\\"brave\\\" ambition to go into more mature directions in that area might then be what the professional movie critics value. But I personally think that while older\\, more mixed\\, darker Luke holds some interest\\, the movie as a whole suffered from \\\"in-between\\\" quality: it was still locked down to the rebels-vs-Empire mould of the original trilogy\\, while struggling to introduce a new setting\\, new interesting characters and most importantly\\, a new mythos that would resonate with a new generation of movie-goers. That meant that it was trying to crash down the old idols\\, ended up doing quite a lot of figure-bashing that did not really go that far (both mythical Jedi-heroes\\, and the evil-sith-lords were pretty pathetic\\, in the end). My only teary-eyed moment came at the very end\\, with the small\\, unnamed boy looking into the starry skies. That did have some promise of the new direction\\, new opening. But this movie just was not yet there. It was still locked in the transition\\, partly just re-making old scenes and re-animating the old\\, pricey IP.","true":true}
