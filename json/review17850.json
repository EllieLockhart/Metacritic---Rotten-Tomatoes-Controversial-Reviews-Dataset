Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It had some decent moments\\, but overall\\, Disney\\, who they themselves\\, destroyed the original EU to make their own EU version\\, have destroyed the franchise with their feminazi SJW bullshit and their lack of compelling storytelling. Superman Leia says it all.","true":true}
