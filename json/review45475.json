Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointed in this movie\\, maybe the weakest in the entire series and that's saying something. The characterization of Luke Skywalker was terrible\\, all the mystery surrounding Rey and Snoke is revealed to be literally nothing (which is fine\\, but then the mystery didn't need to exist in the first place)\\, no Kights of Ren\\, Benicio Del Toro's character was pointless\\, Phasma gets no redemption from TFA and goes out in an embarrassing fashion\\, Finn and Rose's subplot drags and serves no real purpose\\, and the stakes for the entire movie feel incredibly small.","true":true}
