Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a comedy of failures\\, using dated tongue-in-cheek millenial jokes.\\n\\nIt failed to explain the setting\\, or advance a coherent plot.\\n\\nIt didnt even develope meaningful characters who could shape the story. Rather\\, ALL of the characters are molded into roles as per requirements of each individual scene.","true":true}
