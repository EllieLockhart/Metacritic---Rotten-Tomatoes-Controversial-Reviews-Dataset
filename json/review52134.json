Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After the first viewing I was unsure about this movie. There is a lot to unpack. I saw it again last night and absolutely loved it. Go see it again. I think you'll find it a much better experience.","true":true}
