Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst star wars movie to date. The movie is almost completely pointless\\, and where its not its only relevance is inexplicably killing off characters without any explanation. Want to know who snoke is? Nope. Reys parents? Nope. Apart from 2 scenes\\, we could've skipped right to ep 9\\, and even those two scened are bad.","true":true}
