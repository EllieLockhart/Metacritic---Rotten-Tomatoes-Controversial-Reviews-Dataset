Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love and hate this movie. Wonderfully good and bad moments. Going to see it again\\, just to make sure\\, but I'm pretty sure this film left us with no intimidating villain\\, no mysteries worth waiting for\\, and a universe with no internal logic or consistency\\, while simultaneously attacking everything that made the original trilogy great. Rey doesn't need any training from Luke\\, but she can still kill half of Snoke's private guards without it\\, so she really is a Mary Sue and Luke is unnecessary. By the way\\, it was never important for Luke to pass on the Jedi ways\\, because the Jedi are no big deal either. The force will eventually balance itself just fine without them\\, so the lifelong struggle of our hero(s) was pointless. It's as if Rian Johnson was giving a big \\\"up-yours\\\" to the fans. I really hope I'm missing something here. The final film of this trilogy has a large task ahead to explain some of these horrible\\, horrible choices.","true":true}
