Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Made an account to just say how disappointed I am in this film. After TFA I was excited for this trilogy but now I dont even want to see the next one because of how ruined the story is. I mean Johnson took every good piece of story that Abrams created and threw it away. Its such a shame. This movie flat out sucked. Being PC doesnt make a good movie\\, but its clear that some critics and audience members are blind to this. Saw it a few hours ago and still cant stop thinking about how bad it was and how much it really just destroyed my hope for the prequel series. RIP Star Wars: 12\/15\/2017","true":true}
