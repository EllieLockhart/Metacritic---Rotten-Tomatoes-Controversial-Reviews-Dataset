Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Johnson hoped to admire us by stripping us from epic moments in this movie. The result: a numb story\\, boring and shallow. Lucasfilm killed the new trilogy with this episode. Can't believe it has 91% of the critics score. Better than Joker! Unbelievable. Don't watch it. Try to close your eyes and forget what they've done. Run\\, fan! Run!! A don't look back!!","true":true}
