Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You can tell from watching this\\, that Rian Johnson secretly hates this franchise from watching it. The movie makes a meme of itself seemingly on purpose. \\\"It's salt\\\" is the quote that best describes this film as a true fan will certainly be disappointed after walking out of this one. These DIsney directors must not be very friendly to each other as now the films are turning into\\, \\\"how can I mess the next director up more than I was here\\\" style of filming a trilogy. Such a bold move by Disney to take that approach. It's kind of funny in the way that\\, if this was not a Star Wars film\\, I may have actually enjoyed myself more if you replaced all the space ships with cars\\, and the actors with any dime a dozen SJW you can find walking around downtown for five minutes. That's another thing\\, the best forms of propaganda\\, are the ones that make the political points very vague and not so in your face as this movie. So... I guess Chewie is vegan now? Anyway\\, I would say don't watch this one or the next one\\, but who am I kidding\\, fans of the franchise (including me at times) will buy literally anything as long as the Star Wars logo is attached\\, so I guess I'll see you all in the next installment\\, where Disney can let me down one more\\, although not final\\, time.","true":true}
