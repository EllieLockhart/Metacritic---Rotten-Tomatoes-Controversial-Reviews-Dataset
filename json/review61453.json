The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The game is phenomenal. It\u2019s unlike anything I\u2019ve ever played and it took huge risks that many devs would never take.The bad first:My only negatives are that the gameplay can get a little repetitive after awhile and that yes\\, some of the ways things play out are a little unrealistic\\, but I understand why realism is sacrificed in order to make the experience fun for the player.The good:The story is amazing if you can allow yourself to exhibit a little empathy. This game is set in a tough\\, cruel\\, brutal setting. It\u2019s not a world of heroes and villains\\, it\u2019s a world of survivors who have the opportunity take the law into their own hands.Graphics and score are breathtaking.Relatable characters that you get attached to. It\u2019s clear at this point that people are divided on this\\, but personally my favorite performance was Laura Bailey as Abby. Abby is unlike any female pro\/an(?)tagonist  I\u2019ve seen in 30 years of gaming and I really appreciated seeing someone portrayed that doesn\u2019t fit this cookie cutter mold you see from many female characters.  I fear the backlash from the mentally unstable\\, privileged\\, disgusting losers who are sending death threats (DEATH THREATS!?!?) to writers and voice actors over a freaking video game will deter devs from taking these type of risks in a future. My suggestion is that if you are one of these people that are easily triggered anytime anyone other than white males get a little shine\\, if you feel attacked every single time something is praised that\u2019s not white male dominated\\, if you are one of these people that can\u2019t wait to tear down successful media that doesn\u2019t necessarily represent you\\, please stay away from this game. Go play Super Mario and the hundreds of other games that have been created throughout history with only you in mind and live your little power fantasy. Your hatred is only making this game more talked about\\, more relevant and more successful.My suggestion that if you are actively sending death threats to anyone\\, but in this case particularly people who are simply writing and performing a piece of entertainment that literally means nothing in the most literal sense that nothing can mean in the grand scheme of things\\, is to please\\, please seek help. You are an embarrassment to the human race.Congrats Naughty Dog! I hope to see at least one more game set in this universe as I ended the game only wanting more\\, but if this was the last ride\\, it was still more than we deserved.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
