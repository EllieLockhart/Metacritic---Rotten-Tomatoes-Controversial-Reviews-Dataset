Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had some great moments\\, but totally burned down all the things that were important to Star Wars lore. I realize this was needed to make room for a new generation of characters. But it was done in a disjointed and choppy way that left me (as a long time Star Wars fan) disappointed over all. Some of the people I went with where not Star Wars fans\\, they felt this movie was entertaining. Perhaps thats the point of this movie\\, to take the franchise away from the hardcore fans and bring it to the average movie goer.","true":true}
