Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great and complex story. Seemed unusual at first but came together in the end. Doesn\u2019t end the way you think and that\u2019s why it\u2019s great. Johnson pushes the characters to their limits and makes a compelling story all together. 5\/5","true":true}
