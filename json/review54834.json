Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is a different Star Wars movie\\, but moved the franchise in a new direction\\, which it needed. Just like you had people belly aching that TFA was too much like the originals\\, you have the same whining that this is too different from the originals. But\\, that makes it interesting. Yes\\, it had some plot problems (how come the Resistance ships were faster\\, but couldn't gain any distance after 8 hours? et al.)\\, and it dragged a bit in the middle\\, but the character development for the main characters and intertwining paths was fresh\\, compelling and very well done. Ultimately\\, it is what I go to the movies to see -- an exciting story\\, with interesting characters and some genuinely funny moments.\\n\\nIt was also unique for a middle movie in a trilogy that felt like a stand-alone movie all by itself\\, but left me very excited to see where the story will go in Ep. IX. The theme of this movie was to abandon the past to create a new future\\, and that is exactly what this movie did for the franchise.","true":true}
