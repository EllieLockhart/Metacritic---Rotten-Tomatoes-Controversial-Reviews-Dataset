Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This Star Wars movie is something entirely different than any other movie and is completely unpredictable. The main reason that this movie is disliked is also because it's different and unpredictable. I think the movie is great but I can see all the flaws in this movie as well. And the fact of the matter is that this has the same response and attitude toward it as Empire Strikes Back\\, that movie also divided fans and they also didn't think it was the best because of its different approach but now look at it\\, The supposed best in the series.","true":true}
