Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Holy hell that was the worst written movie I have seen. How did Disney give the writting rights to a  Director who only directed one major movie before this. Hope Disney learned there lesson. They are going to burn this franchise to the ground if they don't. I feel deppressed. :(","true":true}
