Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Under-developed characters\\, weak main storyline\\, sub plots that meant absolutely nothing and a complete disregard for everything EP VII set up. The star rating won't let me go with 0 stars so it gets half a star. Won't be allowing the kids to know this movie exists.....","true":true}
