Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A well thought out\\, fresh\\, new addition to the Star Wars saga. In the days of mass produced media increasingly becoming more and more predictable\\, the biggest film franchise on the planet was able to deny the trend in great fashion\\, producing a film that took a different point of view\\, asking for thought from the audience\\, not just consumerism.\\n\\nWhilst there were some issues\\, particularly with pacing\\, the film strongly set out from the beginning to achieve goals. It surprised many\\, all whilst managing to answer questions toward the plot in a way only Star Wars can.\\n\\nThe story was well thought out\\, introducing new material to the Star Wars saga. Contrary to many claiming the film left questions from episode 7 unanswered\\, the film\\, I found\\, did answer these questions in a respectable\\, Star Wars kind of way.","true":true}
