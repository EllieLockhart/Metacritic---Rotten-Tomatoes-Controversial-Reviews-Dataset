Throughout my play through I was made feel a roller coaster of emotions that at some stages I was so conflicted by my choice I was unable to make it. I love that\\, i was so emotionally invested that I was stopped in my tracks by the brilliance of it all. The graphics\\, the game play\\, the music\\, the characters... All amazing.\r\rTo all the haters and completely ignorant people out there bashing this game without even playing it\ror you stopped playing it after a certain scene about an hour or 2 into the game I say this... Grow the **** up. You are a gamer and you are not entitled to the story or game that you expect it to be. You get what the studio creates and you either enjoy it or you don't.\r\rIf you do not like the game then don't be a complete fool and join in on the tirade of insults\\, death threats\\, racism and disgusting acts of many people on social media. To the people who do join in and send horrible things to people get a ****ing life and go back to playing COD where you can kill all day long and beat one off to the 4 kill streak you got.\r\rThe Last of Us Part II is no masterpiece but to me it was an experience I will not soon forget.\r\rP.S. I started it in New Game+ straight away\r\r@TLOU staff\\, thank you very much for giving me such a cool experience :) I hope there will be another game but I will understand if there is not because of all this madness.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
