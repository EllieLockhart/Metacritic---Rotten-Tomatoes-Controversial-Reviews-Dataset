Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars the Last Jedi is THE worse Star Wars film (Yes. Worse than The Phantom Menace).\\n\\nAll Star Wars movies are flawed. New Hope had Storm Troopers bumping their heads. The prequels had bad acting\\, and midichlorians. None of these things in of themselves made these movies unwatchable.\\n\\nI will never re-watch Last Jedi.....Go see Jumanji.\\n\\nLast Jedi was not a Star Wars movie. Some fans seem to appreciate this - it was so different. It was an Rian Johnson masturbatory movie that happened to be set in the Star Wars universe. It was a Rian Johnson screw you to the true fans.\\n\\nIf you love ill-placed comedy\\, that takes you of dramatic scenes\\, well this is your movie.\\n\\nIf you love shocking\\, contrived\\, M Night Shyamalyan moments every 15 minutes\\, then go see this movie.\\n\\nIf you like flying Jedi. Go see this film.\\n\\nOtherwise\\, the bewildering\\, dumb main plot will insult your intelligence.\\nThe way Luke is treated will anger you.\\nThe socially motivated casino side adventure that seems to take up half the film\\, and ultimately serves no point to the overall plot\\, will bore you. (Go get popcorn here).\\nUnanswered questions created in Force Awakens will not be answered\\, and the director doesn't seem to be aware that movie ever happened.\\nEmpty characters like Rey\\, and Finn\\, literally develop news skills\\, with no training or explanation.\\n\\nDo not see this poorly directed\\, and poorly written film. Just don't.","true":true}
