{"101487":175637,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-23","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last jedi really does a good job in devolping the character of Kylo Ren and lives up to the standards that force awakens set.I did however not like what they did with the character luke skywalker however other than that they really also did well in devolping Rey and even adding a great twist on her backstory. The movie answered some questions but still left some question to be desired but this movei stes the franchise on a new path","true":true}
