Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Enough is said about how bad the movie is. There should be some hard lessons for Disney. \\n\\n1. Have one good script writer to tie up a trilogy\\, instead of letting multiple directors play at their whims and fancy. One bad apple ruins the whole thing.\\n\\n2. Don't buy your critics!! The truth will be out eventually\\, and now Disney not only looks bad for ruining a good franchise\\, but appears to be unethical.\\n\\nGood thing I sold my Disney shares.","true":true}
