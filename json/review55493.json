Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My biggest issue is the energy that was devoted to making the characters from previous movies look bad.  Rey was a love struck idiot trying to change a bad boy.  Luke spent years sulking over failure without doing anything to fix it.  Finn was a coward\\, then was upgraded to useless baggage on a mission that didn't affect the outcome of the story.  Poe was a hotheaded dumbass.\\n\\nAdd in Luke dying at the end for no apparent reason\\, taking a break from a space battle to go to a casino and talk about the evils of war profiteering\\, and the overall derivative nature of the movie\\, and you have a steaming pile of shit.","true":true}
