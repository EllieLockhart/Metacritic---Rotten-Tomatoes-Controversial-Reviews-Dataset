Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How disappointing\\, did the writers even see a Star Wars movie?  I thought it was maybe a generational thing but my kids were disappointed.  Disney\\, when you buy the most iconic movie series in the history of film\\, you need to bring your A game\\, this is an F game.  This director\\, or whoever controlled the creative process just gave the finger to fans.  Just terribly disappointed.","true":true}
