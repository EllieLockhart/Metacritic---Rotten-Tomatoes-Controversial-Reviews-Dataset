Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"On the whole a very enjoyable film\\, but not without many flaws. I appreciate where some of the new directions were trying to go but it was the execution that didn't work all too well for me. In the end though\\, the good stuff overshadows the bad.","true":true}
