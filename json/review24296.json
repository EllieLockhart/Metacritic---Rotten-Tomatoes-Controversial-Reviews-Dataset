Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Me when I first heard about the movie:\\nI can't wait to see Luke Skywalker fight an epic battle.\\n\\nMe when I walked out of the theatre:\\nDid I really just watch Luke Skywalker milk Whoopi Goldberg?
