Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fresh\\, unexpected and tonally different to past star wars. nothing is clear cut\\, and characters don't do what you'd expect. A character driven film\\, ultimately about failure\\, perfect as the middle part of a trilogy.","true":true}
