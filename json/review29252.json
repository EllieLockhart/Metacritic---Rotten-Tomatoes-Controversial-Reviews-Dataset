Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(Review not spoiler free) I'm a die hard fan here and all the hate is easily understood : this movie wipes out all the foundations of precedent movies. It is a new start\\, a new beginning. It was epic. But people who throw trash at it all want to have a boring version of a revisited OT (Rey as the legacy child\\, Snoke at Plaguis...come on\\, drop it!) and that's why they can't see the point of the movie. Only open-minded people will really appreciate Johnson's contribution to the saga\\, and how it was all incredibly done. Of course\\, I also think they were some flaws and elements that felt out-of-place. But overall it was an amazing experience\\, and the crowd in the theater cheered brilliantly at all the twists and turns. It's one rollercoaster of a movie\\, my heart was pounding at every second of it. Mark Hamill's performance as Luke was devastatingly good and Adam Driver was at his best as showing the emotional and conflicted Kylo Ren. The dynamic between him and Daisy Ridley's Rey was a masterpiece of chemistry\\, one I have not seen since ESB. Cannot wait for JJ's closure episode.","true":true}
