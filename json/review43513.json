Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was by far the worst Star Wars movie ever. Not One Plot build up over these most recent episodes led to anything\\, no questions were answered\\, there were direct contradictions to not only episode 7 but all the episodes\\, Luke\u2019s Character was completely destroyed\\, Snoke\u2019s character was pointless and the end of the film you don\u2019t even care who wins in the end because so much built up potential was lost. One of the worst movies I ever saw and I honestly wish I never saw it. Equal to the Avatar the last Airbender and Dragon Ball movie.","true":true}
