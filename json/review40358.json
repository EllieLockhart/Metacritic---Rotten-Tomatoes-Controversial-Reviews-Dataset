Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is probably the best Star Wars film I've ever seen - and my surname comes from Rogue One so that's saying something! The first viewing I was constantly on the edge of my seat\\, and the second viewing I just sat on the floor the whole time! I've never wanted to be part of a story more than I have with this. Thank you Rian Johnson\\, for this wonderful creation!","true":true}
