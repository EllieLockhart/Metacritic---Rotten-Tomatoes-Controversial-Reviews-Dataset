Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Man\\, where to begin?  This is not Star Wars movie you are looking for...  The non-story of Snoke.  The inconsequential Finn plot.  The forgettable Poe plot.  The non-story of Phasma.  The curious use of the Force by Leia.  Sit-com humor throughout. This movie was rife with disappointment. On the other hand\\, Rey\\, Kylo\\, and Luke storylines are intriguing. Better than the prequels and Return of the Jedi\\, but falls short of the two most recent installments.  I am still going to watch it again in the theater\\, though.","true":true}
