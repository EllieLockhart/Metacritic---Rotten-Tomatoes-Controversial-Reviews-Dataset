Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is about on par with that of the World War Z book to movie adaptation. It definitely has the Star Wars name but not what I know and have read from the lore. I tried to escape into the story\\, but only found myself asking too many questions along the way. Would recommend waiting to see this movie if you are a true fan.","true":true}
