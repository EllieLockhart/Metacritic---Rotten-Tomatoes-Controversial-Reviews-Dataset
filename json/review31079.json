Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Solid but admittedly flawed. Has plenty of frustrating moments for sure\\, but also some incredible concepts and set pieces. And further\\, sets a grand stage for potential gravitas in the upcoming Episode 9 finale. Don\u2019t listen to the haters! They lack scope. And the last 30 minutes? INCREDIBLE.","true":true}
