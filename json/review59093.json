For me this game really ruined the legacy of the original. Ellie and Joel were great characters in the original. This game was unsatisfying in so many ways.\r\rNeil Druckmann had an very uninspired vision for this project. While I think representing diversity was a positive thing in the game's storytelling\\, I also believe that character development was a failure- which ultimately cheapens the ambitious characters more than if they had just gone with a vanilla action-movie cast.
