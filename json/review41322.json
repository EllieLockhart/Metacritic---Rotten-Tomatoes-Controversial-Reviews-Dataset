Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a hot  bag of shit that may well ruin Star Wars from here on out .Full of SJW garbage and hubris by the director and Disney to needlessly and without explanation kill off characters that frankly leaves the overall arch with practically nowhere to go. How is the first order so powerful? Fuck if I know\\, it's just being left run by a petulant child by the end of this movie.  The mysteries left to be solved don't exist and clearly Disney and company never had any clue nor even intention to solve them\\, but don't worry\\, if you're a fucking retard who likes a lot of flash and humor\\, you'll breeze right through this without realizing that Rian Johnson took a big fat shit down your throat with a nonsensical plot. Star Wars has been left to the morons from here on out\\, have fun ruining a legacy\\, I'm frankly too old to care anymore.","true":true}
