Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw it Thursday night\\, thought it the best since Empire Strikes back. Very personal and human tone to it. Plenty of battles\\, and lightsabers but much more sense of what was at stake if hope did not survive\\, and how small a glimmer of hope can light the fire again.","true":true}
