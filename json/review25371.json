Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No movie will please everyone. I am an original trilogy fan\\, but these movies are about the new heroes. That being said\\, Luke Skywalker FTW. The sub-plot with Finn and Rose took up some screen time\\, but I think that was trying to show us some things that set up the end. A great movie\\, and in my opinion\\, easy top 3 of all the movies!","true":true}
