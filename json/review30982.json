Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointing it\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2s beyond words. Rian Johnson just didn\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2t have the writing skills to continue the great setups that were left by JJ in The Force AWakens. Only watches it once in the cinema\\, that was enough.","true":true}
