Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game was a massive disappointment for me. No I'm not sexist or homophobic naughty dog\\, I just appreciate good games without a political agenda being shoved down my throat. The story is woefully poor and very slim to put it nicely. You need to get your revenge\\, GO ! Parts of the game dragged so much I was falling asleep and pretty much had to force myself through it. Especially towards the halfway point where were forced to repeat the same actions again with a different character... Lazy story telling. Characters are all 1 dimensional and killed off without any real development. Gameplay has barely changed since the first game and still feels as stiff and clunky as ever. And the ending was a downright embaressment that makes the whole game absolutely pointless. What a mess\\, the graphics were nice\\, that's my 1 piece of praise I'll give this game\\, but this is naughty dog\\, and expected at this point\\, so yeah.... Skip this one altogether\\, or grab on a cheap sale\u2026 Expand","true":true}
