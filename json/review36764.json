Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie plot was strange for Star Wars. It seemed really foreign compared to every other movie in the franchise. I was attempting to cope with the poor plot but when it got to the casino scene with manacles and think mustached old timey gambling playboys with a political message about the evil military industrial complex\\, I almost threw up in the theater. I am a die hard Star Wars fan from early childhood and I found this movie offensive to what I once loved. It would have passed as any other sci-fi movie\\, but this not only didn't fit in Star Wars\\, but it actually made me miss Jar-Jar a little as at least he was trying to be funny. This was just sad. I wish Disney didn't pay off the critics so that failures like this get the visibility they deserve so that we don't make the same mistake again. RIP Star Wars. Disney screwed it up worse than George Lucas did.","true":true}
