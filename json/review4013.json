Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Boring throughout the whole film and how do you not see so many mistakes during the movie for example Rey forgetting to duck in Snoke's Quarters and just completely trying to turn Star Wars into a crappy Marvel Comedy","true":true}
