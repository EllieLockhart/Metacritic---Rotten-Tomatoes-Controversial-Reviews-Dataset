Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"thought overall it was a great movie minus a few scenes that it could have done without. I liked the new characters\\, felt that they had depth and purpose\\, liked some of the topics and issues presented in the film\\, and the emphasis on people not being completely good or bad but rather flawed as humans are. Also\\, love the undeniable romantic tension\\, and hoping they will further explore this area rather than kill it off in the next movie. I can see some people having issue with Luke in this movie\\, but again\\, it goes back to showing how anyone\\, as great as they are\\, can make mistakes and are naturally flawed. I loved it and watched it 3 times already. Completely disagree with all the haters!!","true":true}
