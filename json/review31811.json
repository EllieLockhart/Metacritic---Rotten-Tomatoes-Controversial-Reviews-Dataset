Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spam of the star wars saga\\, just a bunch of minced up nostalgia and \\\"good movie\\\" algorithms crammed into the Star Wars can. Very crammed\\, no time to breathe watching this movie it has to jump from one overly ridiculous\\, poorly thought through action scene to another forced prequels style joke to milk the laughs out of you. I would\\, and probably will\\, watch the prequels before watching this again... If this is what Star Wars is now\\, I guess I'm not a Star Wars fan anymore :\\,(","true":true}
