Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw it once\\, and once per lifetime is probably enough. overall\\, I left unimpressed and thought it was a mediocre movie\\, but that translates to disappointment on the star wars scale. Moments of brilliance are sprinkled throughout\\, but it's just so slow\\, the plot is a bit forced\/contrived\\, and the humor didn't land for me. Kylo and Rey had a good dynamic and their fight scene was great. lots of beautifully shot scenes. I was a fan of the Luke ending. The Luke and achtoo stuff drug on for way too long\\, and by the end of the movie I feel like the Kylo Hux dynamic did serious disservice to their characters by turning them from Hitler into Charlie Chaplin. The whole codebreaker (slicer!) storyline had me rolling my eyes. I'm also the type to knit pick on things like the design of the bombers and the problems with weaponizing hyperdrives\\, so that didn't really help my prospects. I wasn't fundamentally opposed to anything they tried to do in this movie\\, but I thought the execution was sloppy. The story telling was a bit weird and left a lot of checkov's blasters unfired. I really felt the GRRM influence of twists and surprise without any setup or payoff\\, and I'm not a fan of that style. I thought that the movie had some interesting messages\\, but it had just so many things it wanted to say that it only had time to deliver a few hamfisted lines about each one. They would have been better off focusing one one or two messages and really developing those with more subtlety.","true":true}
