Fun and joy are not the goals here and I think majority rejects the game exactly because of the complexity of emotions it provokes. And naturally so. Nobody likes such complex emotions which apparently people have hard time processing nowadays and hard time facing the gray area of human existence\\, a duality and complexity we all represent. It is realistic and existential and it is damn hard. It cuts close to the bone to an extent that it is not fiction anymore and seem too real. Especially in times like these.\r\rBut i believe it was necessary reminder. Naughty Dog were brave to do it so perfectly nuanced and on point. They did it very well. Public reaction is proof. They did what they wanted to achieve and not without fighting great doubts i believe. That is how true art is born\\, that is how things change and that is why they should be proud of their achievement even if right now it doesn't feel so rewarding.\r\rPeople need time to process.\r\rI want to believe that after some time The Last of Us II will get recognition as a great piece of art it truly deserves.\r\rWith all of my heart\\, i wish TLOU II creators and participants all the best. Stay strong\\, stay safe and stay Naughty.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
