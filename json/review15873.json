Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love the movie! I watched the whole thing and I wasn't bored at all. Sure it is very different to the orginals\\, I never liked the other movies. the director was horrible\\, and I know this was not perfect\\, but I'm sorry I loved it! I would say they tried too hard on the joke\\, it remind me of the new Thor movie\\, and how it became a comedy\\, and I would agree they need to hold some of them back. But give it a chance.","true":true}
