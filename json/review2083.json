Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A Starwars themed arthouse production to bridge the gap between Episodes 7 & 9.\\n\\nI was looking forward to a darker\\, gritty journey into the characters of Rey and Kylo Ren but instead we got a quasie comedy which was closer to a Spaceballs sequel than a Starwars story. \\n\\nI loved The Force Awakens and I love the new cast but Rian Johnson has delivered his interpretation of Starwars which veers drastically from the Starwars tone set down by George Lucas (NOT including the Episodes which shall not be named) and carried on perfectly by J.J. Abrams.\\n\\nThis really feels like a standalone production which has all the visuals of a Starwas movie but none of the spirit.  \\n\\nSorry for the really negative review but this is part of my Childhood and yes\\, I'm nearing 40 and am currently binge watching Rogue One through to the Force Awakens with my Sphere R2-D2 droid happily beeping away in the background. I'm a nobody and Rian Johnson is minted. \\n\\n\\\"It doesn't have to be quality\\, it just has to make money\\\" - Mark Hamil","true":true}
