Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is wonderful. It is the opposite of the Force Awakens. It is bold\/ ambitious and character driven. Luke is a broken revelation. However\\, I am seeing many negative responses. Breaks my heart. These fans are the epitome of fanboy\/ trolls. (MINOR SPOILER) Rather than appreciate the wonderful artwork here\\, they argue about things like \\\"It should have been Obi-Wan\\\" or \\\"The Force doesn't do that!\\\" Actually\\, these trolls don't know that. The force levitates. The force pushes . . . .I don't understand the hatred from trolls. Beautiful movie.","true":true}
