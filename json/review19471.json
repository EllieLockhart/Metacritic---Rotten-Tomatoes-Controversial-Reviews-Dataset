Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's the most insulting piece of SJW trash I have ever seen. I can't believe that Disney was daft enough to allow this to happen. I can't imagine anyone taking this franchise seriously after this. They truly want to \\\"let the past die\\\". If this is the future... it's a dark one.\\nThe characters we know and love are insulted and not treated with any respect. Instead we get \\\"women power\\\" messages and characters like Rose who have no place in the Star Wars universe. I'd rather watch episodes 1&2 back to back without a pause or the ability to go to the toilet 3 times than watch 15min of this atrocious movie.","true":true}
