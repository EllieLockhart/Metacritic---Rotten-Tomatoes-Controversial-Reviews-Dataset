Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Look\\, I love Star Wars. I\u2019ve always love the series since I was a little kid. When the force awakens came out I was blown away how they tied in the original series and kept the same feel but at the same time keeping the story simple and enjoyable. The last Jedi however is riddled with plug disasters too many things going on in the story. I was also surprised by some of the acting wasn\u2019t up to par especially the character Rose. I thought her performance was Like a low-budget movie. I expect more in the Star Wars film. I have High hopes for the third in the series and hope that they go with a more simple story. ","true":true}
