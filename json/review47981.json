Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While I understand that this film made some very controversial\\, unconventional and unpredictable choices\\, I feel the backlash by the fanbase is unwarranted. This film is great\\, the acting is superb\\, the character arcs (for the most part) are great and the action is amazing. This film was willing to do what fans were saying they wanted for years\\, which is take the franchise in a new direction. I encourage anyone who is on the fence now about seeing this film to go see it and form your own opinion.","true":true}
