Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How many times do you have to reiterate that your trying to \\\"ignite the spark.\\\" Bad dialogue\\, akward character progressions\\, and Luke would never have let his feeling lead him down a road to think about killing Kylo Ren.
