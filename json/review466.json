Even if the character's honesty is 0\\, you can tell the truth for him. It's kind of silly. Or if the character has curiosity at the maximum level\\, you can NOT go for noise and survive for him.\r\rWhat do I like?\rQuite an interesting story\\, the game did not make me bored.\rI liked the mechanics of the totems\\, their search added some variety to the game.\rIn addition\\, you can easily lose one of your heroes (yes\\, for me this is an advantage).\rIf during the battle with Wendigo you press the wrong button\\, then you won\u2019t be able to play anymore for this character\rThe ending also didn't disappoint me (the game went through\\, losing only Chris)\r\rThe game is worth the money and the time I spent on it\\, I would give it 8.7-9 \/ 10\u2026 Expand","true":true}
