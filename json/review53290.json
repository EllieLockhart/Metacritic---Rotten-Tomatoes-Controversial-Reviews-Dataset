Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Completely misused Luke and made his story arc an afterthought\\, completely overused Leia's force ability to a laugh out loud degree\\, added way too many pretty visuals that did nothing to further the story or develop the characters and as apolitical as I am\\, it was hard not to see the SJW slant the movie took. Wanted to go to the movies to escape this type of thing\\, really sucks that even Star Wars as to have an agenda.","true":true}
