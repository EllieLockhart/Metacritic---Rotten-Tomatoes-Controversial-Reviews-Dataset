Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible addition. This movie literally had no point\\, they copied some of the better scenes from Jedi and Empire they then created this insane space chase that should have ended immediately due to tie bombers concision middles or proton torpedos. BB8 is now a super star who can disarm five armed guards and pilot imperial ATATs\\, honestly you could just copy BB8 500 times and have the droid take out the first order. They changed the fundamental way the univrse works and characters act completely different from the other movies it was terrible.","true":true}
