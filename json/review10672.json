Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had me asking more questions than ones answered\\, Luke was the ROTJ but yet he never returned\\, is character was betrayed by bad writing and assassinated. Totally disappointed how Disney handled his character. Positives were the action and and unpredictable twists. Not the worst SW movie made. ","true":true}
