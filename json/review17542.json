Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I signed up just to review this movie. I have loved the Star Wars saga for years but was terribly disappointed in this movie. By far the worst Star Wars movie. The plot is an absurd contrivance. The characters show no development and their decisions are confusing at best and just stupid at worst. The treatment of Luke Skywalker was the worst part with him have no character continuity with the Luke we've watched grow and develop in the original trilogy. There are some nice visuals in this movie but it has no substance and the plot holes are to large to ignore. The flying Leia scene was another misstep. Just terrible.","true":true}
