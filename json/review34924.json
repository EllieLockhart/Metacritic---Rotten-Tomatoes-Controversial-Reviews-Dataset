Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film is good for a general movie. It is MEH for a Star Wars flick. I would say that if it didn't waste time with some parts then it would be better. I think that it deserves a solid 80%. Screw you if you are going to complain and say\\, \\\"Ooh\\, I think that it is a downgrade\\, as it is a bit bad compared to the other films.\\\" It is amazing. Just\\, don't see it in IMAX or IMAX 3D\\, as there is no difference if you do experience it in a special format.","true":true}
