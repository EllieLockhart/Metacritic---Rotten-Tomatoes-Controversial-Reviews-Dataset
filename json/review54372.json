Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have something to say about his movie. The movie was entertaining\\, but doesn't deserve the star wars logo on the cover. I didn't get that star wars ''FEELING'' watching this film. I remember talking with my friends about this film before the premier. I said i got a bad feeling about this film and I hoped I was wrong\\, but I wasn't. The direction rian johnson and disney is taking the saga\\, I disagree with it. It's is not the way it's suppossed to go. and I hate it. I didn't like the way they portraited Luke Skywalker\\, and the only good thing about this film is what Mark Hamill did with his role as Luke skywalker. He did what he got told to do and he performed very good. He deserve a oscar. But still I don't like the way It ended. Since disney and rian johnson have fucked up the star wars saga I have desided to not watch the next film or anu other film disney will release about star wars. Disney they only care about money not high quality. they want to brainwash our children so they can earn money on merchandise\\, toys and the films. Fuck Disney you ruined everything\\, you have destroyed the saga. taken away the hope for a movie. and you have raped millions of fans of their childhood memories. #Metoo","true":true}
