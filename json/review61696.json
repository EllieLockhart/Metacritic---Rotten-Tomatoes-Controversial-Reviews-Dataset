Yes.\r> Is this game THAT bad? No.\r> Is this game worth my money? No.\r> Will I play this game again? Never.\r\rLet me clarify what I mean. I'll rate this game based on the following metrics: Gameplay\\, Story\\, Visual\\, Soundtrack\\, Innovation.\r\rGameplay: Gameplay is somewhat acceptable. This isn't definitely a big step up but it works. No major complaint.\r\rStory: This is probably THE weakest part of the game. If you played the previous games\\, you should know that story has been one of the integral parts of what makes this game unique. Not only this game missed those heart-wrenching and emotional moments\\, but the story also felt forced as ever. It felt like they weren't even trying. A major downgrade in the quality of the story and conveyed no message whatsoever.\r\rVisual: Probably the only good thing about this game. If you don't mind playing a mediocre and not-so-important game for the sake of outstanding visuals\\, grab this one. This game will surely surprise you with eye-catching graphics.\r\rSoundtrack: Soundtrack is good. Not the best one out there but definitely tries to get you immersed into the game\\, which it could've done if it weren't for the boring and inanimate storyline.\r\rInnovation: Zero innovation. Doesn't bring anything new into the franchise. Avid fans like me who eagerly wait for these games wouldn't care much if this game never existed in the first place.\r\rFinal Verdict: If you're considering buying this game and not sure if you should buy the game\\, I'll help you out. DON'T. If one word could describe this game\\, that would be \\\"cash-grab\\\". Naughty Dogs changed their previous gameplay elements and mechanics here and there and shipped this game in a new package. The story is as bad as it can get. It singlehandedly destroyed the reputation the franchise has been building up for years. If it weren't for the eye-catching graphics\\, I don't think I could've sat through the whole game. Not recommended. I hope Naughty Dog takes fans' response as a red flag and focuses on delivering great stories and gameplay.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
