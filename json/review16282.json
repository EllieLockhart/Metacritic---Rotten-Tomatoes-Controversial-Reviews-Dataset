{"101487":136747,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not going to tell you The Last Jedi is a bad movie\\, it simply isn't true but it's also no the greatest and I'll explain why. For the most part I think this has to do with the change of directors half way through the new saga\\, Rian Johnson does something wonderful for this film with it's fun tone but I don't think it fit so much with the first movie\\, to no fault of his own that is. This movie seemed like it would have possibly been much more well received by fans if it were just a star wars story and not a continuation of a saga since it seems like in this film the old characters are disregarded and their arcs are altered beyond belief. For example with Luke and without spoiling it (because that's despicable) he acts very out of character in this film\\, something that is not fleshed out very well and rushed through due to the amount of material that had to be put on screen\\, it seemed like they didn't have time for Luke in this film\\, he's in it very minimally. While I agree the new films are about the new characters (and they're done well) the old ones seemed to be ignored and pushed to the side lines in service of others that paid no resonance to the story. For example\\, a new character Admiral Holdo is introduced but seemed unneeded as a rebellion general due to the existence of a fan favorite Admiral Ackbar. Captain Phasma from the first movie serves as a cookie cutter villain again this time around and does not have any emotional weight or impact on the story when she encounters Finn. Rey has her character developed very well as does Kylo but it is at the expense of the rest of the story with extended scenes with new character Rose and Finn on a side plot that doesn't seem to matter in the grand scheme of things and just as easily could have been cut out with no impact on the film. Many set ups from the first movie are never answered in this movie\\, the light saber is thrown away by Luke and while this serves as a funny joke it takes away the emotions built up by the last movies ending and shows the clashing ideas of both directors play out. It just feels out of the tone that was built up\\, this and many other questions are either left without a resolution or are teased and then revealed to be inconsequential. This is not to say this movie does not have great moments\\, the fight scenes are beautifully shot and make other fight scenes from the previous movies look rookie. Some moments with old characters are done very well and isolated are amazing on their own. Daisy Ridley does Rey almost better than the first film and Oscaar Isaac as Poe steals the show again as the new Han Solo type. Mark Hamill does a great job returning as Luke and sells some of the character changes better than they would have read on paper. John Boyega makes Finn's character seem different from the first in a good way but he is also still portrayed as a coward only to prove himself later to not be which seems like the same beats hit in the first movie and already established. Which was an unfortunate backtrack\\, nonetheless he was still a great part of the movie in his parts but the parts with Kelly Marie Tran seemed unnecessary\\, while she executed the character very well it seemed she was underused as Rose. I thought the character was very interesting and not really someone you would see in the foreground in a star wars movie but I would have likes to see more of the character if she had a notable effect on the plot. Overall this is a good movie and well worth the watch\\, just for Adam Driver's Kylo Ren\\, it's very different from the first while keeping all of the good aspects of the character and he is by far one of the most tortured and intriguing characters of the film. A note on the porgs also\\, which I hear as a complaint is not really\\, we had Ewoks after all. Anyways I do recommend this movie even with critique. It is a good movie and don't let people tell you otherwise\\, every movie has it's flaws but that doesn't mean this one is without it's gems and gem foxes.","true":true}
