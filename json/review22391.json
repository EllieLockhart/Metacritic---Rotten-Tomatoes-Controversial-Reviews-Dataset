Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lazy writing\\, stupid subplot that doesn\u2019t contribute anything to the story\\, and worst of all\\, changing the whole identity of a beloved character for no reason at all.","true":true}
