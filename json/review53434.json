Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disrespectful to SW iconic characters. Made Han Solo a dead beat dad who left his wife. Luke Sky Walker a pessimistic whiny coward. Didn\u0092t Luke voluntarily surrender himself to Vader and The Emperor to save his friends and help turn his father. Didn\u0092t Han come back and save Luke in a suicide mission and destroy Death Star even after he was paid. Come on Disney you took a King Kong dump on Star Wars. Complete lack of respect. Lack of respect for nostalgia and the older characters. \\nIm all for women equality but wow you really do hate men. Every male character had huge flaws and major issues and had to be saved by women. Disney you need some counseling. \\nI hope Jumanji takes all the box office money next couple of weeks. \\nI\u0092m done with Star Wars.","true":true}
