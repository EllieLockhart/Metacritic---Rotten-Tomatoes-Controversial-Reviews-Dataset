Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A solid chapter in the series - I thought it did a good job moving the story along and developing the characters as they struggle to the inevitable conclusion to the series we will see in the next installment.","true":true}
