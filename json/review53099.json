Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At first I loved this film. It was the newest Star Wars and I was so excited that a new movie in the came out. At first I loved the one liners but then realized there was way too many and they weren't funny. I hated Luke's storyline from the first time I saw it. I hated the B plot where Finn and Rose went to the casino planet\\, but I still was able to overlook it because it's Star Wars. \\n\\nAs time passed\\, my opinion has changed drastically. I was truly heartbroken over this movie. Great visuals is the best thing I can say. I have been a life long SW fan. I actually love the prequels. I thought everyone overreacted over those films. This is different. The fans are right. TLJ has ruined Star Wars for me.","true":true}
