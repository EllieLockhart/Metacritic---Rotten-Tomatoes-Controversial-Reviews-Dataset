Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good: Visually beautiful\\, sounds beautiful\\,\\nBad: While some of the humor was funny\\, it was in a lot of not appropriate spots that tended to ruin dramatic moments.  \\nPlus there where certain story plots that went nowhere and wasted time like the casino storyline with rose\\, who while I'm sure is a good actor\\, the whole role was boring.\\nThrew where also a few things that just didn't make sense like Admieral puple hair hodo not telling anyone her plan and sacificing herself when the audience hadn't even really bonded to her.  It just didn't feel right.   Also what they did to Luke's character.   I listened to the extra where Rian Johnson explains he idea behind this movie\\, and while I can admit there where some good ideas there and it could have been a good movie if executed much better\\, that didn't happen.   So watch it for the visuals and the throne room scene \\, but write the rest of the movie off.","true":true}
