Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were a few magical moments. But every time there was something dramatic\\, it undercuts itself.\\n\\nThe overall plot makes no sense. Formerly deep characters are flattened to 1 dimension.  There is no reason for this mess to be as bloated as it is.\\n\\nDisney went from promising in Force Awakens\\, to puzzling in Rogue One\\, to making me think they are trolling the fans in Last Jedi.\\n\\nI will continue to watch these movies...I am a sucker. But it's not with any joy.","true":true}
