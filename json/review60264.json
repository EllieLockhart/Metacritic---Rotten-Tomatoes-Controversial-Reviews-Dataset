Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Last of us 2 is an amazing follow up to one of my favorite games.  Naughty dog always out do them selfs with each new game they release and they did it again.  The environments in this game are incredible and push the ps4 hardware to the limits.  I like the semi open worldness they added and makes exploring and finding collectables more challenging and rewarding.

Not much has changed as far as combat and upgrading your character\\, they have made few improvements to the combat which makes it feel much more fluid then the first game.  Sounds in this game are incredible i dont think i have heard such great sound effects in a game before.  The facial animations and voice acting is the best I have ever seen in a video game.  I enjoyed the story very much\\, it took me places i wasnt expecting and made you have certain feels even though you didnt want to. The only part that i did not agree with was the ending\\, I think it should of finished off a certain way.  Great story driven first player game. Ill be looking forward to LoU3 on PS5.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
