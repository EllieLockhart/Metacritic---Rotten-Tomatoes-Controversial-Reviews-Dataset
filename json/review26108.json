Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not only was this movie complete garbage\\, but it spits in the face of everything that came before it\\, which\\, for a sequel movie that is 8 of 9 movies.....the penultimate installment splits the fandom in half because it creates plot holes throughout the whole series. If i could give this less than half a star\\, I would. Why? Because not only was this movie awful\\, but instead of sweeping it under the rug like most production houses would\\, Disney has spent the past year attacking the critical fan base; name calling\\, having their underlings write hit pieces in garbage media magazines. Disney has failed in one of the simplest business rules: The customer is always right. As a company\\, you have forgotten that and you will continue to cause malice among the fans until you make an honest effort to smooth things over.","true":true}
