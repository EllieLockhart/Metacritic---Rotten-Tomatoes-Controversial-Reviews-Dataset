Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have to counteract the haters and say that I really LIKED this movie. Not perfect by any means (there were plenty of things I didn't care for)\\, but it is much better than Force Awakens. A lot of people\\, including avid fans\\, will dismiss this movie because it actually challenges expectations and forces you to THINK. Do yourself a favor and don't join the knee jerk reactions you see on social media.","true":true}
