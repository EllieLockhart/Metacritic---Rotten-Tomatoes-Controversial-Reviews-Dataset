Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No Spoilers*... Ill be honest\\, i was a little disappointed that this film didnt go the way i thought it would... the first time i watched it. I have been a diehard fan for as long as i can remember\\, but when Disney dumped all of the expanded universe content in the bin (over two years ago now)\\, i wasnt happy. After watching this film for the first time\\, i was clearly still smarting about this\\, and my feelings were very mixed. Certain things did not happen that i had previously read about or dreamed about and this left me confused and disappointed\\, while at the same time thoroughly entertained\\, (talk about ambivalent) because at its core this is a very good if unpredictable\\, Star wars movie. Upon second viewing\\, things made a lot more sense\\, and while i think improvements could be made\\, it I get why Rian Johnson has done what he has. I suspect that many of the negative user reviews are based around the fact that many had a specific idea of what the perfect story line would be\\, and were left disappointed. But if you look at it again\\, and judge it for what it is\\, not what you wanted it to be\\, I think you'll find the critics\\, for once\\, have got it right. Better than FA IMHO.","true":true}
