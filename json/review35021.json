Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Finn and Rose Story was awful and not needed at all. Snoke was handled with poorly and so many questions left from force awakens weren\u0092t really answered here. I feel there was four films chopped up and put back together to make this. Don\u0092t get me wrong there are some amazing moments but something was off and didn\u0092t really feel like a proper continuation from Force Awakens. Ray was week also. It was overall a pretty film that lacked any real geek moments. And what\u0092s with Princess Superman?","true":true}
