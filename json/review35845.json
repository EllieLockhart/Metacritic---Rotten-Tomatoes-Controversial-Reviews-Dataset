Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi might actually be worse than The Phantom Menace\\, if you're a Star Wars fan i recommend you wait for another cut of this mess. \\nRian and the writers did a terrible job and i hope they don't mess up the 3rd installment.","true":true}
