Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointed. Not what I wanted or expected. The acting was very good. The fight action was good\\, though I wanted more. The plot-twists are interesting\\, but I feel the characters would not have made those choices in the story. I'm glad the director won't be doing the next episode.","true":true}
