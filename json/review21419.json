Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wish they would just stop making Star Wars movies now. Theres nothing interesting about them\\, bad forgettable characters and no story. The critics sure seem to love this one though\\, i wonder how much disney paid them? Ill rate this 5 stars for 50 dollars!","true":true}
