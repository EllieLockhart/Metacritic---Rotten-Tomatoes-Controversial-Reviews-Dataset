Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After the joy of seeing Mark Hamill onscreen again wears off\\, I'm left with this horrible film which dishonors the lore\\, the original characters\\, and the rules of this world which were established in the original trilogy.  Not only that\\, but characters such as Finn are negative\\, racist stereotypes of black people as he is cowardly\\, flaky\\, weak\\, incompetent\\, and he's desperately trying to impress the women around him to the extent of PRETENDING to be heroic.  And then the movie is decidedly politically left-leaning when past Star Wars movies took no side in politics\\, and that leaves this movie smacking of Marxist propaganda.  I can't see how Star Wars can possibly recover from such an aggressive attack against everything that made this mythology beautiful and welcoming to ALL PEOPLE.","true":true}
