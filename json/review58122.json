{"101487":198758,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie! This movie *might* have been decent (like 3 stars) as a companion movie\\, but it just didn't *feel* like Star Wars and therefore was completely jarring and out of place in the main series. Here are the specifics of what I didn't like (minor spoilers):\\n1. The plot points established in The Force Awakens were either totally ignored or completely subverted in what felt like subversion for subversion's sake.\\n2. More than one major character acted completely contrary to his or her established nature for most of the movie.\\n3. Too many jokes. I don't go to a Star Wars movie wanting to see a high ranking Rebel pilot prank call a high ranking First Order official. But more than just how it affected the tone\\, they were often in jarring and inappropriate places.\\n4. Overall\\, 2\/5 star writing.\\n5. The plot was really stupid\\, actually. Boiled down to the slowest space chase ever with the only excitement added being that they are running out of space gas.\\n6. Bad guys\\, except Kylo\\, were completely inept\\, sniveling\\, incompetent\\, and totally undeveloped. Where are the Tarkin's of this trilogy? I mean\\, come on\\, *some* of the other bad guys have to know how to do something right.\\n7. Bad character development on the light side too. I literally walked out caring less about the characters than when I walked in. New characters were introduced with no time to develop them in ways that made me actually care about them.\\n8. The visuals weren't anything to write home about. Seriously\\, where are the cool space battles we saw in the prequel trilogy? They did a lot wrong\\, but the visuals were breathtaking. Also\\, the few new worlds were either stupid or underutilized.\\n9. No light saber on light saber action. (Seriously\\, wtf?)\\n10. Music and sound editing was completely underwhelming. Just way below the rest of the franchise.\\n11. It honestly felt like Rian Johnson specifically went in trying to spit on everything that made Star Wars something I loved. None of what I love about it remains. The characters who are usually the ones to save the day (who happen to be the characters I like best) are the ones who muck it up and the message of the original trilogy and Rogue One is completely undermined. Again\\, it feels like it subverted expectations (not specific plot expectations\\, because you can't expect a movie to conform to how you thought it would go *plot-wise*\\, but rather expectations about the over tone\\, moral of the story\\, and characters) just for the sake of subverting them.\\n\\nWow\\, I guess I hated this movie more than I thought. This started off as a 2 star review\\, but the evidence has piled up. Going to have to make it a 1 star. \\n\\nJust as in 1977\\, Star Wars fans everywhere were quoting the line \\\"Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi\\, you're my only hope\\,\\\" now Star Wars fans everywhere are thinking \\\"Help us\\, JJ Abrams\\, you're our only hope.\\\"","true":true}
