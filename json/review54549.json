Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a recent fan\\, like less than a year\\, and I'm not attached to the canon that took place before The Force Awakens. The character that intrigues me the most\\, and who is the reason my interest in Star Wars has not only continued but grown\\, is Kylo Ren. I wasn't sure what to think of him in TFA; I felt disgust and horror at his actions and immaturity\\, but also reluctant admiration for his strength and stamina. That's one powerful\\, messed up guy\\, and as a writer\\, I'm simply fascinated by his character development. I've seen TLJ four times in theatres--unprecedented for me--so that I can watch the interactions between him and Rey; I swear every time I notice more nuances in his expression and demeanor that have me rethinking his motivations. He seems to wear his emotions on his sleeve\\, yet I'm never convinced I know exactly what he's thinking. Rey\\, on the other hand\\, is as easy to read as a large-print book\\, but that suits the character. All of the performances were great\\, but in my opinion\\, Adam Driver is exceptionally talented.\\n\\nWhat I could have done without in this movie is everything to do with the Finn and Rose storyline. I don't care that much about Finn as a character (I was okay with what he wanted to do at the end)\\, and though I do like Rose\\, I was so engrossed in the rest of the story that I was impatient for their irrelevant scenes to end. I know which chapters on the bluray I'll be skipping--and I know which ones I'll play on repeat. \\n\\nI liked Poe more this time around\\, liked BB-8 less\\, wanted to stand up and cheer for Holdo\\, wanted to smack Luke upside the head (with affection\\, like Gibbs)\\, and I'm still torn as far as Leia's concerned. On one hand\\, I'm saddened and disappointed that she wasn't the mother Ben needed\\, and on the other\\, I sympathize with and have respect for the strong woman who survived so many trials and tribulations. I mean\\, no one can do it all\\, and it's interesting that she's a better general than mother (which is debatable\\, considering how much ground the Resistance has lost). Usually it's fathers who take that stance. I cannot imagine what they'll do with her character in IX without Carrie Fisher (R.I.P.).\\n\\nI'm very excited for the next episode; I would much rather see IX this year than the Han Solo movie.","true":true}
