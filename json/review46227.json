{"101487":193244,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD\\nI have thought about this film long and hard. I am somewhat mixed about some of the new elements introduced\\, but overall\\, I enjoyed this flick and it refreshes the Star Wars universe. Let me start off with the bad. I really had a problem with the scene where Kylo kills Snoke. I felt like the scene was very forced\\, and it almost felt as if Johnson did not care about an interesting character Abrams wanted to be developed and just did it his own way.Another part I was concerned with was the humor implemented into the film. It made me cringe a few times and it almost seemed as if Johnson was trying too hard to be comedic. Lastly\\, I feel like the part where Rey tried to convince Luke to teach her the ways of the Jedi  kind of slogged on and didn't get to the point. I feel like it could have been cut down a bit . Suprisingly\\, many hated Canto-Bight but I somewhat enjoyed it because it brought good memories of Bespin. I will agree\\, the character of DJ did not make much sense and felt forced\\, but I found the alternate story line of Rose and Finn to be interesting. Now\\, time for the good. Let me start off by saying this: It is time for the Jedi to end. There is always an end for everything\\, and I feel like Star Wars has to experience a new order of force-sensitive heroes. The fact that Rey is the first powerful force-sensitive person in her family is refreshing\\, and shows how anyone truly cn hone the powers of the force within them if they take the time to find it within themselves. But who knows\\, maybe Abrams had an intention all along to make Rey related to a Jedi this whole time\\, and will find a way to make it work in Episode 9. But either way\\, I am completely satisfied. The telepathic communication between Kylo Ren and Rey is one of the best elements that I have ever witnessed in a Star Wars film. Not to mention\\, the scene where Luke looked out over the sun right before he died is one of the best scenes ever in a star wars movie next to the one where Luke looks out over the sun in Episode IV. The battle of  Crete is reminiscent to the Battle of Hoth in the Empire Strikes Back\\, bringing back good memories of watching that film. The last scene where the force sensitive orphan summons the broom to him brings hope for the next generation of Jedi to come\\, and how anyone can can truly be a Jedi if they are determined. If you have seen the movie and needed something to help you decide whether you liked the film or not\\, I hope this review helped. May the force be with you all!","true":true}
