Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everyone seems to hate this movie because they were disappointed that it wasn't a movie in which characters sit down and explain their shocking origin. Movie sequels need to be unique\\, and develop the story naturally with some twists and turns along the way\\, and TLJ does that very well. My only complaint would be that Rey is not a very compelling character at the moment\\, yet some people seem to think that's because she's... a woman. Weird\\, long story. This movie has great action\\, some absolutely breathtaking scenes\\, cinematography and great special effects.","true":true}
