Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I found the action and humour to be once again fantadtic. My only issue was it seems the new director has purposely sabotaged in Abrams plans. How smoke was dealt with left me feeling annoyed that after all this wait I learned nothing about him. The fight scene I  smoked throne room was fast paced and exciting although I question how ray got so good with a saber since luke only gave her 3 jedi lessons. But over all a great film.","true":true}
