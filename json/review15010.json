Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I knew what I was walking into\\, and it was about what I had expected. Just ok. \\n\\nI really don't care for this story line\\, they would have been better off following the fan fiction than throwing it all out the window for a poorly devised one in the name of \\\"something new\\\". If thats what they wanted\\, why not bring in some of the more prominent fan fiction writers to be part of the process? \\n\\nThat being said\\, the visuals are pretty awesome\\, and the characters are likable. Curious what's next\\, I don't really think Kylo makes a very convincing sith Lord\\, hopefully they bring in something darker\\, more sinister\\, like the Sith Lords of the old republic.","true":true}
