The gameplay is good\\, similar to TLOU1\\, however\\, I found the plot\\, the message\\, and the character development cheap and tiring. This game feels awkward and at times even boring\\, maybe due to poorly developed characters combined with a linear story and repetitive combat scenarios\\, at least for a 20+ hours journey. Many of the characters dialogues felt disconnected from the multiple shocking events that were presented to the player. In my personal experience\\, the game tried to push some feelings so hard that they ultimately lost me. In the end\\, instead of being immersed in the universe\\, I was more like\\, oh look here the writers are using these tricks to make me empathize with this one character as opposed to this character who is doing this other thing\u2026there is a lot of plot armor and is hard to ignore. Moreover\\, there is a new character who basically has a very similar arc than TLOU1\\, which is ok but this is done in a pushy\\, rushed way and at least for me it did not work. It is interesting how I went from caring about the people in this universe to being completely disconnected\\, and now I just don\u2019t care what will happen to them. I think if this were a TV series\\, that you can leave it on the background while doing some other activity is ok\\, but as a game that requires almost all of your attention its a waste of time. Maybe the writers were trying to do some kind of \u2018social experiment\u2019 because It is hard to believe that no-one pointed out the flaws during the production stages. However\\, I do not know if having such a polarized reception and making a game to shock and promote hate is something to be proud of.\r\rI loved the story of TLOU1 because I found it fresh compared to other post-apocalyptic worlds (e.g.\\, the walking dead). I think for someone that doesn\u2019t care too much about story and consistency this is just a cliche plot\\, the gameplay is fine. If TLOU1 has a special place in your heart\\, I would recommend to not buy this game without reading more about it\\, because the advertisement is kind of misleading and you can find yourself wasting your free time on an unpleasant experience. I think the best aspect of this game has been its progression from a tragedy to a comedy\\, the fact that many people overcome this kind of disbelief together and ended up laughing about it and letting it go\\, better titles will come. In my opinion\\, this game is to be bought on sale price and a reminder that sometimes preordering may not be the smartest decision.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
