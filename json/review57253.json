Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had a lot of potential to be good and make up for the disaster of a plot line left by director J. J. Abrams\\, but the new director did the polar opposite. The movie is full of expendable one off characters that die almost immediately after being introduced to the plotline\\, and Mary Sue Rey is as impervious to having to actually train for her powers as ever. The movie rips apart any theories about Snoke and Rey's family by telling the audience they were nobodies. A purple haired one off character fails to disclose an important plan to the Rebel fleet\\, causing it's complete annihilation. Luke Skywalker is not allowed to redeem his mistakes\\, and the once mighty\\, hopeful\\, and proud jedi is reduced to an old hermit living on an island. To top it all off\\, the ending of the movie was a commercial for toys. Horrible movie!","true":true}
