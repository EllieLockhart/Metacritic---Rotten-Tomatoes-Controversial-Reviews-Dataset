Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hands down the worst Star Wars movie ever made. Tarnished and disrespected the story that was built over the last 30 years. Logic in blockbuster movies such as this isn't super important\\, but the rules set by the Star Wars universe should be followed\\, not changed to serve the purpose of the irritatingly dumb story being told.","true":true}
