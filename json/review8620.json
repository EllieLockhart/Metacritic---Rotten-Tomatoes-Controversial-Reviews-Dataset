Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First Star Wars movie I found unenjoyable. The CGI is great\\, character designs are great\\, OST is good (John Williams)\\, actors did a fantastic job as well... but the overall plot and character development is beyond bad. Every time the movie gets good (or somewhat decent)\\, it gets ruined by an immature joke or \\\"certain groups\\\" political agenda.","true":true}
