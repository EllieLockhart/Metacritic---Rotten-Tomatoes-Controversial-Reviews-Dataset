Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not sure what movie many of these other reviewers went to see. I loved the movie and enjoyed the story. There were a few things that kind of bothered me\\, Leia flying through space and Poe prank calling a star destroyer. But they weren't enough to take away from the rest of the movie. \\n\\nThe best thing I c say is to go s it with an open mind before you buy into the negative reviews. It is not perfect\\, but it's worth going to see in the theatre and then drawing your own conclusions.","true":true}
