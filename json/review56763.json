Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie wasn\u2019t horrible on its own but in context to the other films it is horrible. So many missed opportunities with this one. Lots of irrelevant scenes.. Finn and Po story was so pointless. Snoke was uneventful and Luke\u2019s character is basically shattered ... not sure how it\u2019s Gunna work in episode 9 with Carrie Fisher ... overall pretty disappointing ","true":true}
