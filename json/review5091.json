Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Criticizing and rating this movie is quite difficult.  As a movie\\, it is a very well-done movie with a really strong direction and film quality. But as a Star Wars story\\, it feels like a waste of time and through most of the movie\\, a continuous trolling of the millions of Star Wars fans that went to watch this movie. I'd dare to say that is an \\\"Anti-Star Wars\\\" movie that de-constructs the heroic mythology that took 40 years to be created. ??\\nI get that the overall narrative looks to disassociate the Star Wars mythos and portray that sometimes that good guys are just ordinary people and that raise to the occasion\\, and that many times things don't go as planned. But the many times through the movie in which the writer basically \\\"poops\\\" on cherished Star Wars connections and canon\\, becoming offensive.  From a \\\"not so funny\\\" dismissal of a cherished relic to the complete and utter destruction of the main character of the original trilogy\\, to the point that even Mark Hamill expressed surprise and sadness. If the idea was to bring new characters that could save the Galaxy demonstrating that you don't need to have Skywalker blood to outcome challenges\\, \\\"Rogue One\\\" did a much better job while remaining a fun Star Wars movie.\\nIs this a terrible movie?  NO\\, it is not. But at this moment I feel it was made to break Star Wars in a million pieces and the re-assemble it to the kind of story that Disney wants to sell for the generations to come. So\\, I am rating this movie as a Star Wars movie and not just as a piece of cinema\\, and that is why I am rating it so poorly.","true":true}
