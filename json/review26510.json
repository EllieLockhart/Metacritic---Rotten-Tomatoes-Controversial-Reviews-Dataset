Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Of course the basket of unfuckables hates it. The bad guys don't like to be reminded that they are the bad guys or that they are inevitably going to get the shit kicked out of them by a bunch of women. Buckle up trash\\, it's only going to get worse for you\\, in the Star Wars Galaxy AND the Milky Way.","true":true}
