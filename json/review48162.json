Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While this movie isn't perfect it's not terrible either. Definitely brought down by stupid character decisions that were only made to further the plot. Doesn't set the table well for episode 9 but the movie is still competent.","true":true}
