Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As an individual movie\\, this was okay.  Visually pleasing\\, great action sequences\\, and excellent performances.\\n\\nAs a Star Wars movie\\, this is not good. The plot feels lazy and it doesn't really progress the story at all. It could benefit from another pass in the editing room.","true":true}
