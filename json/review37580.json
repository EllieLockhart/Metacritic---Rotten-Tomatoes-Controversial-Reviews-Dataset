Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is enough in this instalment of the franchise to ensure you are always sitting on the edge of your seat. The plot is no longer a re-hash of old stories like in Force Awakens and new characters are well-developed. \\nThey could have put in a few more light saber battles! \\nOverall\\, great film!","true":true}
