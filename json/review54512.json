Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love the Star Wars films but this loses it for me. The effects are stunning but that is the norm for any big film.\\nThe story however was \\,sorry for this\\, American..the 'let's do this' rebel rousing comments faced with insurmountable odds comments are awful. The links to other films are cheesy. The whose the daddy story line has been done too many times. The cute furry animals scenes and poorly timed jokes are nothing more than crowd pleasers. Freeing the animals awww moment is not in keeping with Star Wars. The scenes where everyone seems to die but the stars are grim to watch. The drunk looking Carrie Fisher who seems not to able to string three words together is awful. Ade Edmundson great guy but from the young ones to a Star Wars baddie doesn't work for me. \\nThere's loads more critique I could add but sadly this film has not done it for me.","true":true}
