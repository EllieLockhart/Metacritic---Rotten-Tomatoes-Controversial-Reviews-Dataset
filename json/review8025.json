Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fanatics will be dumbfounded\\, people who like movies like the avengers and other junk food copy and paste movies will love it. You get Leia doing a marry poppins in space\\, bombs dropping in space\\, SJW propaganda\\, and much much more. You're gonna love it.","true":true}
