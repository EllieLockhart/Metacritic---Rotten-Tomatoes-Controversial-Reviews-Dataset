Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked The Last Jedi. After 2 years of waiting\\, actually I liked it. I mean it's not the best movie ever made or even the best Star Wars movie. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi is one of the best examples of visual storytelling. It has action scenes\\, that are very interesting and slow emotional scenes that are very good. Points to Rian Johnson of making many characters much more developed. Rey and Kylo Ren became much more self-confident and Kylo isn't anymore just a whiny little boy trying to be like Darth Vader like he was in The Force Awakens\\, and Rey learns to be more independent. Poe is much cooler here than in TFA and  wants to do right and isn't just a-side-character-that-is-a-good-pilot -thing. Finn although didn't change much\\, but he's still good. Leia in the other hand was again a strong leader\\, that I love (rest in peace Carrie) and in the end of the movie Luke became again the character that was 7-year-old-me's idol. Hux became the military leader I wished him to be and Snoke's death is also the final death of Ben Solo and the true birth of Kylo Ren. \\nMovie had much comedy and I think that most of it was funny\\, although all of it wasn't necessary. The battle scenes were also awesome. Especially I liked the Crait battle and Rey and Kylo against the Praetorian Guards. The scene\\, where admiral Holdo destroyed Snoke's flagship made just a little bit sense\\, but it was really cool.\\nAlso the scene\\, where Yoda appears was really nostalgic and a cool way to bring the character back\\n\\nAnd then to the bad parts:\\nThe film had much characters\\, which I think all weren't necessary. Rose Tico was an interesting character\\, but for my opinion also pointless. Poe could have taken her place in the mission. The subplot was also interesting\\, but it felt pointless and rushed. Admiral Holdo would also be out of the movie. She could've been replaced with admiral Ackbar\\, who would've told the plan to Poe and there would be a subplot that makes more sense. Also I feel that Phasma and Maz Kanata weren't necessary in the movie and could've appeard just in Episode IX. \\nIn the end\\, when Rose saves Finn from sacrifying himself\\, it doesn't make sense. Sure she wanted to save him\\, but if Luke would not have appered the entire Resistance would have destroyed. Good game Rose\\n\\nBut anyway\\, thank you if you read this far\\, and I totally understand fans that disliked this. When I walked out of the theater\\, I was disappointed. But then I realized\\, that I was disappointed only because it wasn't what I was ready to see. I underatand people who didn't like this\\, but if you say this movie ruined Star Wars\\, I don't get it. What could possibly be so bad in one movie that it ruins the whol franchise?","true":true}
