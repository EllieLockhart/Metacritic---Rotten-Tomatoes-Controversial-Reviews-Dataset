Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing.  It seems like Rian Johnson tried to take the franchise in a new direction and placate the original fan base all at the same time.  Unfortunately he failed at both.  Poor character development\\, poor storytelling and a complete disregard for all the plot development of the first film.  I miss Jar Jar.","true":true}
