Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It made me Darth Vader... no greater conflict within me than being completely entertained and thoroughly disappointed at the same time. The new characters story arcs are fantastic\\, except for one\\, but what they've done with he legacy characters is almost sacrilegious.","true":true}
