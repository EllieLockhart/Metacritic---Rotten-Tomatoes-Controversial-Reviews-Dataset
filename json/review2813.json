Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful movie. RJ has zero respect for what made the movies great in the first place. Luke is and always will be what makes the original Star Wars trilogy amazing. To toss the character aside and leave the fans with a broken\\, empty\\, jedi was the wrong call. We waited our whole lives to see what Luke has been doing for the past 30+ years and it was a bitter disappointment with no possible chance at redemption for his character.","true":true}
