Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is nothing but changing all of the original intent and story of the first six movies. It is a Progressive hell that finds this an overly manipulated story to play to the Liberal ideals of multiculturalism\\, woman power\\, and sluts in heat. And the sluts are as much male as female. Very little of it is really new or 'fresh'\\, but as expected as you could imagine it to be. \\n\\nFrom a percentage value\\, I'd give it about a 15%\\, solely for some newer special effects and quality of the fighting segments. The lady playing Rae\\, and the black dude p;laying the 'hero\\,' are really very poorly done.","true":true}
