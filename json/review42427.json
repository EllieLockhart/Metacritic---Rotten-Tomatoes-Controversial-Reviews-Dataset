Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a disappointment. It is worse than any of the prequels. Not only does The Last Jedi disrespect the previously established star wars lore and characters\\, but the film makers have continuously insulted the fan base creating an enormous rift between all who once loved Star Wars.","true":true}
