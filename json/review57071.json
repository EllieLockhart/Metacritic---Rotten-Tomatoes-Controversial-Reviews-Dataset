Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was a Star Wars movie in name only.  It was the only SW movie in my 40+ year history of enjoying these films on opening weekend that I've ever turned to the people I was with afterwards and put two thumbs down.  I was like \\\"what the eff did I just watch\\, because it wasn't Star Wars and that sure as sh*t wasn't Luke Skywalker?\\\".  I can appreciate taking the franchise down a different path\\, but not when that path leads directly to a toilet.  Many others have stated their dislikes which I completely share\\, and I won't reiterate them in this post.  I hated this movie so much that I sold my stock in Disney because if they can't take care of Star Wars\\, then what can they take care of?  I don't see how the damage to the franchise can be repaired in the next film.  The Skywalker Saga is dead and Rian Johnson killed it.","true":true}
