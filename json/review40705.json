Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This latest installment in the Star Wars saga is wonderfully done. It is a 2 1\/2 hour thrill ride that any true Star Wars fan will cherish as a wonderful continuation of the story started so long ago. It is hopefully a template for how future films will continue to entertain me and other fans.","true":true}
