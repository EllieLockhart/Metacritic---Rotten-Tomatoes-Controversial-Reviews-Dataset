Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This Thursday\\, I watched what I regarded as a worthy edition to the Star Wars canon. The Last Jedi\\, although not an entirely flawless film\\, actually relied heavily on the flaws of its own characters to tell a story that felt refreshing to this series. The outpouring of fan criticism and outright vitriol toward Rian Johnson and the choices made for this new installment have me wondering if a lot of people missed the central thesis here. This\\, a more subtle and nuanced chapter of Star Wars than we are used to\\, spoke toward the vulnerabilities and short comings of its characters. People who wanted the tour-de-force might and resolve of Jedi Knight (now Master) Luke we last witnessed in RoTJ were sorely disappointed by the reserve the character shows in the film's brilliant\\, climactic moments. This is an older\\, hopefully wiser character who still proves he has room to learn\\, both from remnants of his past (in the form of a beloved and much appreciated cameo appearance by a certain Jedi Master) and the promise of the next generation of heroes. The film ends with Skywalker confident that he is leaving the galaxy in capable hands. \\n\\nEven though the Resistance largely fails at every turn throughout The Last Jedi (admittedly among some convoluted and drawn out subplot) it is only to stress a central tenet that binds every Star Wars movie together neatly\\, much like the living Force: hope prevails. \\n\\nI think if people let this movie breathe for awhile\\, they will come to appreciate the unique approach to an already beloved franchise. Gorgeous set pieces\\, some of the best lightsaber fight sequences\\, and enough major plot twists to keep viewers guessing and constantly entertained\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi WAS the movie I was looking for *waves hand*","true":true}
