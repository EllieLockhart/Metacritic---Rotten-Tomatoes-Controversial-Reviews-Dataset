Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointed\\, I\u2019m easy to please when it comes to Star Wars. I even enjoyed the prequels and TFA. All my questions from the first film were never answered except one. What the hell was the point of Snoke in the first place? His character\\, backstory\\, and involvement in this movie make ZERO sense. Luke and Rey interactions are mediocre at best. So much potential. I always leave a Star Wars movie thinking deeply about it\\, talking about it\\, and anxious for the next. I feel nothing after this one. As a movie in general\\, it\u2019s meh. As a Star Wars film... are you effing kidding me Rian Johnson? Thank god you\u2019re not doing the next one.","true":true}
