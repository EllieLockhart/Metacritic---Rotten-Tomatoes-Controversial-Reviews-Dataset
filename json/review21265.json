Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went into this film with an attitude that perhaps the owners of the franchise were bleeding the public dry what with the regular films and these new spin off films.\\nThe saga continues from the events of the last film and without entering into any plot specifics I can safely say that my negative attitudes were allayed.\\nThe casting has been one of the strengths of these films and so it continues.\\nA new director Rian Johnson is behind proceedings and perhaps his inclusion brings freshness to familiar faces and events.\\nThe film does drag on perhaps twenty minutes or so to long in my opinion. I have a new bladder test when it comes to films over two hours!\\nThe CGI in the film is used sensibly. Some great location photography is included. (Not in outer space).\\nAll in all a solid entry in perhaps a formulaic series now?","true":true}
