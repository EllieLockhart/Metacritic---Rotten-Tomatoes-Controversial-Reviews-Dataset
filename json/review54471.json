Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved the movie. I thought it was creative and original. We saw some things we haven't seen before and were waiting to see. I know a lot of people are disappointed about the character development. I honestly think there was a sufficient amount of character development. Killing Smoke quickly placed more emphasis on Kylo Ren and the main Villain which i thought was a genius twist. Luke was very believable considering what he went through. Lastly I think Rey didn't need to be related to a previous character when Kylo is already. To have two decendants of previous characters show down would have been too chiche. A new force sensitive character was badly needed. I know a lot of people wanted Rey to be a Skywalker\/solo or even Kenobi\\, but Star Wars needs to move on otherwise it's just silly that characters children keep fighting each other. The galaxy is much greater and expansive than that. People need to get it out of their heads that characters do not always have to live on. Change was needed. The movie was original and creative. I think they did well with this one. I give it a 9\/10.","true":true}
