Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Such a disgrace to the previous game. This was supposed to be the continuation of the first game\\, which the false advertisement showed us. Everything I liked from the first game\\, the relationship between our two main characters\\, the depth of their personalities\\, the story of hope in an uncertain world\\, all of it was taken away. The franchise was all about the story\\, you would think ND knew that since he co-wrote the first one\\, but no. He just threw it all out the window within the first two hours of the game\\, and then tried to make us feel sorry for a despicable side-character through the 2nd half of it.\rEven if we ignore the plot holes and inconsistencies throughout the gameplay\\, the story still feels forced and poorly written. It tried to make us feel guilty about violence even though it gave us no choice to avoid it. The message it tried to convey was soo dumb.. like we didn't already know revenge was a bad thing. I hated the Abby gameplay\\, I actually considered quitting many times but I kept playing with the hope that this story would turn out to be one of Ellie's nightmare.. which would still have been a better plot that the one we were given.\r\rThank you Neil Druckmanm for ruining a franchise with so much potential\\, at least it will serve as an example for future game developers.\r\rI'll give it a 2\/10 for the graphics improvement\\, and out of compassion for the people who worked hard on it during 5 years.\r\rIf you liked the first one\\, don't buy this game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
