Who has the same personality when they were 14 as they did when they were 19\\, not accounting for trauma and PTSD and what that does to a person (and puberty).\r-\\\"The Death of _____ was done in a poor\/un-heroic manner\\\". The truth hurts and so does reality. This game was meant to be a Grimm parallel to if this was reality.  Nobody is immune to death and that's what makes it great. The early death in this game prepares you and gives you that underlying feeling that anyone could die at any moment. There are no beloved protagonists in reality and nobody is immune to dying in the most stupid ways possible. If I was in the apocalypse I would probably make it to day 50 before ripping off a hangnail and dying of blood-loss or something ridiculously stupid like that (I know it's not really possible\\, it's an analogy)\\, and that's reality.\r- The Story sucks. This is the most widespread criticism and one that I can't refute nor confirm. After playing through the game twice\\, I honestly loved the story. There are flaws as with any game but liking or hating the story is a matter of opinion. I\\, like most\\, hated Abby with every fiber of my being- even after playing her for a few hours! It wasn't until the end of Abby's playthrough that I realized I actually started to empathize with her which brings and inner-conflict to the player that I can appreciate.\r- \\\"SJWs agenda\/Ellie is gay so the game is bad\\\". Get over yourselves.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
