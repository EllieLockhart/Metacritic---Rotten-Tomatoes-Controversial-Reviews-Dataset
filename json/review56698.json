Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The message that Disney wants to give with this new trilogy is clear: the old does not work and must be eliminated. Only young people can be protagonists. Those who are no longer young (although they have been heroes\\, although they have been icons of several generations and still have much to give) must be eradicated or at most relegated to secondary roles or ephemeral protagonism. The only achievement that Disney can boast of will have been wasted the last chance to give the most important saga in the history of cinema a worthy final. Because although Han and Luke return\\, without Leia it will not be the same. Now J. J. Abrams should go for the remainder of the original trilogy. Do not shake your pulse J.J.\\, you've done it before and you can do it again. Put Chewie\\, R2-D2\\, C-3PO and Lando on the Falcon and shoot without fear. Di$ney supports you.","true":true}
