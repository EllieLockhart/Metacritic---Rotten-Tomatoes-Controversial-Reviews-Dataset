{"101487":132303,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2019-02-06","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If the Dark Side were a person\\, this would be the movie that it would make. For all the fact that the Star Wars orgional movies of the 1970s brought people together\\, helped us all to see one another as fellow travelers\\, this movie devides\\, breaks\\, and plants a bitterness between people that might easily turn towards hate. I've never seen the name of a unifying franchise like Star Wars used in such a poor way. Star Wars was the classic fight\\, good v. evil. I'm not sure what this movie is but\\, it is not that. Failure doesn't cover what this movie is. Failure is when you don't succeed at something. This movie attempts to not only destroy itself but also the good will\\, hard won mutual human appreciation\\, which the past movies worked hard to gain. I personally am upset at people having the arogance to tell me what I should and shouldn't like. The answer to that kind of behavior is\\, \\\"no\\\". No\\, you don't get to tell me what I should and shouldn't like\\, believe\\, what values I should have\\, or that I am a bad person for seeing\\, not what this movie is\\, but what this movie does. It drives we fellow humans away from eachother\\, the absolute opposite of what Star Wars does. I won't be watching Star Wars Episode 9\\,10\\,11... whatever. Not until someone in this franchise remembers what Star Wars is all about\\, bringing humanity together with common values and ideas which we all share\\, family\\, loyalty\\, hope\\, respect (exactly who doesn't like respect and enjoys being disrespected)\\, etc. I feel sick just thinking that such fundamental ideas\\, ideals\\, values\\, and goals for one another have been forgotten. That and the plot holes need to be seriously avoided. So\\, I'm going to forget that\\, Rogue One\\, SW: the Force Awakens\\, Solo\\, and this movie\\, were ever made and alow whomever at the top to reflect\\, gain wisdom\\, and learn and then start over. Wipe this divisive garbage off the face of the Galaxy. Star Wars was never a \\\"for the critics\\\" movie and the arogance that the critics have by claiming that this movie has\\, \\\"all the emotion-rich action fans could hope for\\\". Unfortunately\\, if that were what Star Wars meant to the fans\\, that might be accurate but\\, that isn't even close. Star Wars does mean timeless\\, core values like\\, freedom from oppression\\, love (as an act\\, not a feeling) winning over hate (as an act\\, not a feeling)\\, reason and clear thinking winning over blind emotionalism and uncontrolled passions and feelings. Hate leads to the Dark Side. This movie is nothing more than a hate filled sermon where female bullies are justified. I'm sorry but\\, \\\"never\\\". I don't care what you look like or what you do or don't have between your legs or on your chest\\, hate looks equally ugly on everyone. This movie is as ugly as they get. Mutual respect and appreciation is for everyone. Hate isn't for anyone. I've this before elsewhere and I say it again here now\\, \\\"hate isn't something you control\\, hate controls you. And\\, no one\\, who ever hated anyone\\, hates the object of their hate more than they hate themselves. Hate is an all consuming emotion\\, devouring those who feel it faster than the people who(m) are the objects of their hate. Star Wars has been consumed by hatred\\, the core value of the Dark Side. Obvious to anyone who values love\\, both as a feeling and as a way of living life.","true":true}
