Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie took my childhood heroes; mocked\\, and destroyed them.  This movie inserted politics into Star Wars and shoved them down my throat.  This is nothing more than a mockery of what Star Wars should be\\, but is an insult to all Star Wars fans.  I'm done with this series\\, in hopes that I can remember what Star Wars once was.  Thanks\\, Disney...","true":true}
