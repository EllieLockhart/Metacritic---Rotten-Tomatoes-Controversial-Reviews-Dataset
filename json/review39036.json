Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Things are bad enough without this clumsy and ineffectual polotixL propaganda - is there no where you can escape from politics these days?\\n\\nAs everyone is saying\\, the plot holes and treatment of the Star Wars reality are truly shocking\\, how did this get made? Loved the first and second of the Disney made ones but what on Earth were they thinking here? I've never been an out an out Star Wars fan but you just don't care about these characters and it's a real shame what they've done to this.\\n\\nBut\\, also\\, can someone explain how the critic score on this site could possibly come about? Implications really don't ok good.","true":true}
