Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed this film so much. It pushed the story forward\\, it expanded on the force. I appreciated each character arc. The cinematography was great. was it a perfect film no\\, there rarely is a perfect film\\, but it surprised me and lived up to my expectations. I truly enjoyed watching it and thats all i can really ask for. The acting was also stunning all around. It's not my favorite in the franchise but it does have several of my favorite scenes. My main critique of the film is that if felt like a bridge movie. I mean\\, like it was there solely to get us from point a to point b. I don't think that takes away the enjoyment or the quality of the film but it felt more like set up than it's a film within a franchise. Which is both good or bad\\, depending on your point of view.","true":true}
