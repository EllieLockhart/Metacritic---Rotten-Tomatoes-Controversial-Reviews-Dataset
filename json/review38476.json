Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars film ever honestly there isn't much of anything to love about this movie. It spits in the face of previous Star Wars content\\, or ripping off content from the EU\\, or other movies.\\n\\n\\nRian Johnson's vision mirror's George's when he was writing the prequels in such a way it's a shock no one made a scene telling him this is exactly the kind of mistakes of the past.\\n\\n\\nRey continues to be a Mary Sue only experiencing failure once being manhandled by Snoke. Who then dies in a pathetic manner despite all his power.\\n\\n\\nInstead of making a call back to the OT after dealing with Yoda and lifting his ship from the depths of the water Luke makes a projection robbing us of him doing anything significant other then buying time.\\n\\n\\nFinn\\, Poe\\, Holdo\\, and Rose only destroy the rebel forces with them in a convoluted manner.\\n\\n\\nOverall TLJ is the equivalent to a wet fart in your face. Doesn't matter though I'm sure RT admin will think I'm trolling. This movie really deserves no stars.","true":true}
