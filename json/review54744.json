Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Is this the worst thing to happen to StarWars? No\\, the Holiday special\\, Ewok\\, and Droid animated movies still exist but this is behind Attack of the Clones by a lot. The Last Jedi tries to balance the development of multiple characters and plots to no avail. Instead of getting a single coherent movie I was left watching what felt like 3 or 4 TV mini series events all strung together. To the films credit it is incredibley  pretty and their use of practical effects enhanced by CGI harkens back to the original trilogy. \\n\\nThere are so many \\\"what the hell\\\" moments that you can almost tell how long the movies been running by marking them. Overall the movie felt incredibly rushed with little to no direction other than establishing a new direction for Episode IX to take the characters. I left the theater in utter bewilderment and had no desire to see the next installment. Obviously\\, I will see how the trailers for the next film feel when I see them but as of now I don't care about where the plot goes. \\n\\nSee the movie for yourself and get a feel for it. I\\, however was just dissapointed by the film and couldn't see myself seeing it again in theaters like the other films.","true":true}
