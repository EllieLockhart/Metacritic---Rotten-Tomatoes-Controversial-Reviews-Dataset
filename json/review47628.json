Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What was done in this movie to destroy the Sate Wars Universe could not be matched by any of the other movies combined. The level of disrespect given to previous characters (Luke and Leah) was detrimental to the film. Plot holes abound and the way characters were just killed and new characters introduced on the spot only illuminated how lazy the writing was. A few good action scenes and cute porgs aren't going to help this mess. Time for a reboot.","true":true}
