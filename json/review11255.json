Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly really loved this movie. I'm confused on why so many people dislike it. The symbolism is beautiful as is the cinematography. Several important characters were given storylines they deserved in a way that felt right. There were a few parts that were cheesy or felt rushed. But overall this was a great sequel to The Force Awakens.","true":true}
