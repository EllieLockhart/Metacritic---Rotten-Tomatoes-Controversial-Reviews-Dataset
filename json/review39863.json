Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a transitional film\\, and longtime fans may not be ready for that transition. It is about change\\, and it draws the viewer into that change on a lot of levels.  I think it is very smartly done\\, but we will have to see the final film of the trilogy to judge this one's merit.  On its own\\, it has a lot of the clunkiness of the prequels\\, but here it is not the lines that are awkward\\, it is the scenarios.  It is so beautiful and funny you could overlook those flaws\\, but combined with the changes that arrive with the film\\, I think people will be harsh.  Like Rey looking for a teacher\\, this movie leaves the viewer with things we do not understand\\, and that completely undermines the certainty and comfort of the Star Wars universe.  This is one long cliffhanger\\, and it does not go the way you think.","true":true}
