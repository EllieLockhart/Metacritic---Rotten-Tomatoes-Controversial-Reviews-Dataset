Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Full of plot holes\\, inconsistencies\\, stories that went nowhere\\, no character development\\, threw out everything from the previous film\\, a glorified toy ad. No feeling of destiny or emotion which is what makes Star Wars great - only superficial resemblance to the real Star Wars. Character of Luke Skywalker was ruined\\, for a lame story.","true":true}
