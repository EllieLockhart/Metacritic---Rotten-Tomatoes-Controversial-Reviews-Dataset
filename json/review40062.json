Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is my opinion. I know this movie cut the fanbase in half. But I thought this was a great movie. All the actors did really good job. And the visual effects are amazing!! Great writing and direction. This movie sets up a great place for Rise of Skywalker to begin.","true":true}
