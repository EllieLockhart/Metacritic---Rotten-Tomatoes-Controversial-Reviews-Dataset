Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Went to this movies with such excitement only to be so disappointed. This was a movie about a petulant pouting Luke who was disappointed things didn't go his way so he quit the Force. So slow and boring I took a bathroom break midway through. And let's not forget Lisa's newfound nonsensical ability to wake up after being blown into the universe and \\\"fly\/float\\\" herself back to the ship. Seriously the too many attempts at humor felt forced and contrived. I love everything Star Wars but this movie left me feeling cheated.","true":true}
