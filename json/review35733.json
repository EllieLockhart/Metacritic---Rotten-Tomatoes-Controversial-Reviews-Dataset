Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is beautifully written\\, directed and executed by the entire cast. It isn't difficult to see why this movie is extremely divisive: there is a theme throughout of 'letting go' and this applies to audiences\\, too\\, and therefore The Last Jedi must be approached with an open mind. Leave fan theories and expectations outside of the movie theatre. If you were one of those disappointed with the familiarity of The Force Awakens\\, then this movie should bring you ultimate satisfaction. \\nAdam Driver's performance as Kylo Ren is particularly outstanding\\, along with Mark Hamill's best performance as Luke Skywalker yet\\, and Oscar Isaac (Poe Dameron) who's character is greatly developed upon in this film.","true":true}
