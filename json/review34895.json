Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film did alot well. I thought that the good parts of the film compensated for the bad\/pointless parts. It wasn't a perfect film but I enjoyed it\\, which is what should happen. Could have cut out alot though. It felt like 2 different films seletaped together untill the very end so the pacing was off. Finn and rose felt pointless but Luke\/Ray\/Kylo were awsome","true":true}
