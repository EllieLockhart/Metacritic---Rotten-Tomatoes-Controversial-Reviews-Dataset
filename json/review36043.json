Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi subverts almost everyone's expectations following The Force Awakens\\, initially throwing dedicated Star Wars fans. However\\, aside from a few petty details\\, I feel that this film's unexpected twists and development along with its poetic nature have given the saga a new model\\, rather than completely remaking the original trilogy. For me\\, this fresh approach has made each re-viewing of the film more enjoyable and engaging than the last.","true":true}
