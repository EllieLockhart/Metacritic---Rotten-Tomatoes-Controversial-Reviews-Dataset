Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars has been destroyed\\, that\u2019s how bad this movie is! Yoda can cause a lightening bolt on a different world???? Ok - next movie is easy\\, force ghost Luke\\, Yoda and OB1 can just appear and light Kyle Ren on fire. Also anyone that is force sensitive apparently can survive in space\\, through an explosion and fly around. That means and force sensitive person can be blown up in space\\, and if you think about it\\, can be blown up anywhere and they should be able to survive. THATS HOW BAD THIS MOVIE IS! It\u2019s an insult to the fans and made a mockery of all the thought and passion put into the original idea for $$$$$$$. ","true":true}
