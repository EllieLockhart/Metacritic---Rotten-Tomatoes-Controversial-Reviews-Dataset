Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful awful awful!!! Disney please stop pushing Rian Johnson on us or and fire Kathleen Kennedy. Of course this review is late. I've only seen the film once and this is the only Star Wars films I don't own. There is a reason i don't own it. it sucks. i hate they flying princess Leia and how Luke is just a shell of who he once was. Burn every copy of this film. it's such a waste of time. one thing we do prior to upcoming star wars films\\, is watch them all in chronological order\\, not the order in which they were made. I'm not looking forward to rewatching this piece of garbage. sand getting everywhere and jar jar binks are both better than this piece of space trash. ","true":true}
