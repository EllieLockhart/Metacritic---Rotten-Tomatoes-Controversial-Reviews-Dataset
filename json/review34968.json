Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film takes the series into a new direction. It suffers from some pacing issues and isn\u2019t afraid to end characters as fast as thrones does. Some great action sequences. Overall a solid addition to the new saga.","true":true}
