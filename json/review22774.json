Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Literally THE WORST Star Wars movie ever. The film actually breaks the SW universe in more ways than one. It kills Luke's inner character in the first minute you see him on screen. Finn is probably the most underused and Rey is so over powered is just dumb.","true":true}
