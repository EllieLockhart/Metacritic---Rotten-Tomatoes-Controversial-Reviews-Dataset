Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Definitely one of if not my favorite star wars movie. Saw it opening day and couldn't stop thinking about it so I'm seeing it again today. I saw absolutely nothing coming and loved the turns it took. True there is a slower section but I think the rest of the movie completely makes up for that one part. All in all its a new turn for the franchise with risks took in this movie but I think they pay off. Loved the direction a majority of characters took not really one I could complain about. Personally would definitely recommend it!","true":true}
