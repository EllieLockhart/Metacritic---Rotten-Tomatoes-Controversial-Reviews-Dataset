Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is garbage and a propaganda film disappointed that Disney would allow this franchise to move in the direction they did.  Strong diverse characters led by Rey\\, Finn\\, Kylo Ren and Poe Dameron only to be lost in in your face blatant political correctness and the lack of use of strong characters that made Star wars special is just a slap in the face to fans  and unfortunate for new fans.  My kids will not watch this movie again.","true":true}
