Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Only one word to describe the latest entry of the Star Wars Saga - Unexpected. In a very good way though. The best advice I can give is to forget the fan theories and go into this film with an open mind. This movie may not be for everyone\\, but for some like myself\\, it's a game changer. This is not going to go the way you think.","true":true}
