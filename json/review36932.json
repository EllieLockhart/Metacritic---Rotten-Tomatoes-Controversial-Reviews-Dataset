Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was great. My theories I had came up with didn't end up following all the way through but I am happy with the end result. I think the overwhelmingly lukewarm audience score is from over-hype. The movie has  been hyped for 2 years now. 2 years of theorizing and guessing and hype-building. Yes the movie has some flaws\\, but what movie doesn't. It was a good movie and\\, at least to me\\, a good Star Wars movie.","true":true}
