Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the worst Star Wars movie ever! They ruined the character of Luke Skywalker completely. The writing was atrocious as well as the narrative. I left the theater completely let down. I was excited to see it and I had not tried to predict anything. Episode 4 was my first movie seeing as a child so I have grew up with Star Wars. Also the continued onslaught against the men in the movie was so demeaning. I am tired of Hollywood portraying men as mindless buffoons. Over 50% of the fans that I have read their reviews also hate it yet the critics reviews are stellar. What the hell? Are they even fans of Star Wars?","true":true}
