Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was decent but it failed on a couple things that may have ruined the franchise. 1st off Star Wars is suppose to be serious\\, pun jokes don't work in this. Also\\, the plot needed some fine tuning. It didn't work and it felt rushed on too it. It's a shame because this franchise means a lot to people. \\nNow it's just become some money maker for Disney to throw out every year without considering the fan base at all.","true":true}
