Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Beautifully shot\\, but that is it... plot wise it's a huge mess\\, if you have to read books to see where this was heading in a 2\\,5h movie where almost no development happens\\, then something is bad\\, really bad...and still a lot of it just insults any intelligence and logic of the viewer. Lore\\, what lore?... This were no twists or taking chances\\, it's just poor writting.\\n\\nRIP","true":true}
