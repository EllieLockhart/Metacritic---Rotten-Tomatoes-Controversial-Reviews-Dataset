Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Here's my super quick\\, non-detailed review:\\nI'm a HUGE Star wars fan. I get what other fans are talking about and I know the movie was not perfect with all it's flaws\\, but this movie\\, to me\\, was REALLY good. This was better than The Force Awakens\\, which was\\, for me\\, the underwhelming one of the 2. I was a bit disappointed by what they did with the BIG BAD\\, but who knows\\, we might get to see more of him in the next movie (although unlikely). Also\\, I'm curious on how they will follow through with what happened to Luke at the end. Is he *SPOILERS* one with the force Or just teleported (highly unlikely)? Overall\\, I think it was really good\\,  a lot of twists and turns and also a lot of loose ends. Hopefully\\, we fans are able to wait for Episode IX and hope that it would solve MOST (if not all) those loose ends and give justice to some of those RISKY (or maybe questionable) decisions that a lot of fans are mad about.\\n\\nGo watch it and join the discussion!!","true":true}
