Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm confounded as to how this movie could have so many negative reviews. I thought it was incredible. It strips away the standard and over-simplified \\\"good\\\" versus \\\"evil\\\" narrative to explore a more complicated version of reality in a way that's highly relevant to today. You can tell that a lot of thought went into the script and the development of overarching themes\\, from the exploration of Luke's imperfections\\, to Kylo Ren's complex relationship with the Empire\\, to the conversation that Finn has with the code breaker about the ethical murkiness created by war. \\n\\nI also really appreciated the level of character diversity that came through in the film. I didn't grow up seeing many strong Asian women on screen--instead\\, Asian women tend to be portrayed as fragile\\, docile\\, hypersexualized\\, or harsh and emotionless. I was so excited that there was a normal-looking Asian American woman like me in a lead role\\, playing a character with emotional depth. It's hard to explain what it means to be able to see yourself reflected in your culture's stories of you aren't a member of the majority group.\\n\\nI agree that Leia's unprotected spacewalk felt ridiculous\\, but I don't think that warrants rating an otherwise powerful movie 1 star. I also didn't feel that there were that many plot holes-everything (with the exception of surviving space suitless or Rey's rapid improvement in swordsmanship) felt pretty well explained. I anticipate that unanswered areas of the plot\\, like what happens to the code breaker or who the other boys were who followed Ben\\, will be addressed in future films. Who Snoke is and where he came from isn't really relevant. (But perhaps that will be answered by another movie 40 years from now haha.) Regarding the dark force that Rey encounters below the island\\, I think it's helpful to consider that scene metaphorically.\\n\\nThe effects were strong\\, there was plenty of action\\, and it was otherwise fairly similar to former films in the series. I can't think of a logical reason why this movie rubbed so many people the wrong way\\, other than that it challenges social norms for storytelling by including more women and people of color. But sci-fi is THE genre to push boundaries and challenge us to think more critically about the world we live in. If you are upset about increased diversity and the narrative shift away from simple good vs. evil storytelling\\, perhaps sci-fi just isn't the genre for you\\, and a Western would be a better fit.","true":true}
