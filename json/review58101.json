Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie and just a bad movie in my opinion. Abandoned everything that made the original movies great. The actors do their best to save this movie from being just awful. None existing plot\\, story\\, character development. So many charecters stories where just wasted in pointless scripts. The story of Luke Skywalker the greatest fictional hero character ever made that risk it all to saved his father from the dark side was turned into a guy that gives it all up becsuse he had a bad vision and tries to kill his nephew wtf?! Oh god and the ending. This movie has to bee seen just to believe the big fuck up by Disney. A movie that probably cost them 300-400mill to make but failed to get someone that could write or even cut the movie correctly. This movie was not Star Wars and people will write books how bad it was.","true":true}
