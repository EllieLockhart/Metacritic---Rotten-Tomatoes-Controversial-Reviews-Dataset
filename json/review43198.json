Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This Star Wars fan of 30+ years was left feeling very dissapointed in the direction that the franchise has been taken. Plot holes\\, bad directing\\, worse acting\\, cheap laughs and a spit in the face to real fans.","true":true}
