Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian's vision of Luke Skywalker is fundamentally different from how Luke was described in Legends and imagined by the majority of Star Wars fans. Luke tossing the lightsaber over his shoulder set the tone for the rest of the movie.","true":true}
