Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Only a true genius could write a prison break story\\, where some prisoners leave the prison to find a locksmith who'll help them break into the control room to turn off the searchlights. \\n\\nDo they wear disguises or dig a tunnel? Haha\\, not in this story. They just walk out the front gates. It's a complete success. Then they get arrested for parking in the wrong place.\\n\\nLuckily they find a master locksmith in their cell. So it all works out. Such a multilayered plot. Incredible.\\n\\nWhen they get back they find out that the prisoners had a better plan while they were gone. Sneak out in broad day light. Wearing cloaks of invisibility.\\n\\nThey are actually bed sheets with no concealing effect whatsoever. And nearly everyone gets shot. Nobody feels particularly sad about it.\\n\\nSome other stuff happens\\, but who cares?\\n\\nIf you can start watching a film half way through\\, while eating a meal\\, and still enjoy it\\, you could enjoy this film. Forget the story that led up to this point\\, because it no longer matters. The film makers do not think it is relevant and nor should you.","true":true}
