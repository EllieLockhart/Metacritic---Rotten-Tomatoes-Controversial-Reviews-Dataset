Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had problems with too many corny jokes on times when they were not necessary\\, Finn's adventure was completely pointless and boring and we did not get almost any background info from Snoke\\, Rey or anybody else and that time was wasted on Chewbacca eating a grilled Porg or Finn's and his crew's casino adventure.","true":true}
