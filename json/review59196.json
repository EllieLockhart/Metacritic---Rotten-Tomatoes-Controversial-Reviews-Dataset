The Game play is almost Perfect and improved over the Original\\, Could not put the Game down\\, same as the Original. So much Fun to play. THE STORY IS TRASH\\, and this is almost the complete Consensus of Fans. Joel dying was to be expected and that's fine! BUT and playing as Abby wasn't ideal\\, BUT the one thing that destroyed the game for Me\\, and Everyone it would appear is what the did to Ellie. They completely destroyed Ellie\\, the ruined her Life\\, she let the people she loved go\\, and she can't even play the Guitar now\\, so sad and disappointing.
