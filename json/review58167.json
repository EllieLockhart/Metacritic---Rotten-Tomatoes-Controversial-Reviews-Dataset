Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"WTF is this shit!!?? This a Star war movie...NOT. Not when 90% of what you watch are all about the characters getting emo. no epic light saber duel\\, no force powers use\\, no respect for the lore\\, shitty political messages waste of time (canto bight)\\, too feminist (all the men are made to look like useless idiots)\\, ridiculous scenes - Leia flying in space\\, spaceship low on fuel need gas station??\\, puny villains that only invoke ridicule - Snoke killed off in 1 sec & Kylo is a emo pussy. (compared that with Palpatine and Vader who inspired fear and trepidation) \\n\\n...but the greatest and most unforgivable sin is reducing our iconic childhood hero Luke Skywalker into some emo cowardice teats milk sucking hermit\\, and in the end he died of tiredness and disappear with a whimper like a fart. It is as sacrilegious as turning Wonder woman into a striptease call girl or James bond into some uncouth hooligan\\n\\nKathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson need to have force lightning up their asses for destroying the SW legacy!","true":true}
