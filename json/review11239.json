Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly loved the characters in this movie. I think this film will be a good bridge between Force Awakens and Episode 9. There are scenes I disliked\\, but the good far outweighs the bad in this film.","true":true}
