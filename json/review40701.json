{"101487":183352,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-02","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This latest installment carried with it a new hope\\, that we might actual see something truly honoring the franchise that jumped into hyperspace long before a Mouse was at the helm. Instead\\, the Disney empire strikes back again and I'm left wondering whether or not one of those womp rats that Luke used to bullseye in his T-16 back home\\, wasn't perhaps the father of another two meter rodent we've seen around these parts of the galaxy. Should that Jedi return\\, he'd be sure to get an earful.\\n\\nIf you happen to like a Star Wars character that Disney didn't create\\, prepare yourself. These last two movies put Jar Jar into perspective. At least Jar Jar was his own character\\, not an attempt to tarnish one already well established\\, in the hopes of improving the pecking order for a Disney created personality. A rising tide lifts all boats\\, yet the last two films sunk a few of Star Wars' most seaworthy while they were docked. I find the lack of synergy disturbing\\, between the new direction and the origins that founded it. \\n\\nHan? Just a deadbeat dad that bailed after his son lost his mind at boarding school. Stab him in the back\\, but go through his frontside to get there\\, then send his character arc spiralling downward into the foggy abyss\\, palpatine style.\\n\\nChewy? Show him literally chewing up something lovable while it's family watches him do it. Just imply the decapitation\\, skinning and the burning it at the stake part. People won't feel so bad when we kill him off in the next film.\\n\\nLeia? People know she died in real life\\, so let's bring her back to life in the film somehow and co-op her into the microwave generation of iJed.com'ers. Park that website also\\, just in case some fan has a million ideas of how to make fun of us for this outrage.\\n\\nLuke? Senses way to much good in relatives that have actually done lots of bad stuff. Let's find a way to have him try to kill his nephew for bad stuff he just thinks could happen. Then we'll park him on Alcatrazean to serve a life sentence and if he even imagines himself trying to be awesome we'll throw him the ol' 900 year old birthday he deserves.\\n\\nEpisode 9 will probably feature R2-D2 leaving with that good arm C3-PO seems to be missing. It'll be revealed that C3-PO is really just a child predator who's force ghost had to be permanently confined inside a metallic suit for public safety reasons. The Solo movie will likely show us how the Kessle Run was fake news and how Chewy's name would still be Kevin if Han hadn't show up on the right cancer-ridden tabacco-farming planet at the right time with a cargo load of Nicorette gum. \\n\\nI felt a great disturbance in the Force\\, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. The real rotten tomato here are those 90% critic approvals being promoted by anyone who can cash in on it. At least this site shows they exist\\, unlike iTunes.","true":true}
