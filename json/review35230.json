Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":" The Good: Adam driver and Daisy Ridley are excellent as usual\\, especially when they are interacting with each other. But it\u2019s as if they are in a different movie than everyone else - which was the movie I came to see. When Laura Dern crashed into another ship. This short scene is a true work of special effects art in its self. The Bad - so many places to start... No mo Poe! Just too much of a dull one dimensional character speaking from a pez dispenser of cliches. Don\u2019t Finn with me! See above and repeat Watching Luke Skywalker get water and fish on an island is like watching someone get water and fish on an island. Plus he was grumpy and the entire island scene with Rey should be considered an extended bathroom break. ","true":true}
