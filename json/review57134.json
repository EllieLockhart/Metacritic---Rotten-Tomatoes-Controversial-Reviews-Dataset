Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not a classic Star Wars movie\\, its different...but GREAT. Let me break it down\\, but beware\\, (I never do this but in this case its needed) there are spoilers ahead: 1. Snoke and his backstory - who cares\\, just another tyrant who dies a quick death at the hand of his apprentice. Its not about Snoke. 2. Rey's parents - nobodies\\, which seems anticlimactic\\, but I like this angle. Who says great folks come from great backgrounds. Some rise like a rose from dirt. 3. Great Escapes - the great amazing escapes we are used to dont happen\\, fine by me. Plans dont always work out\\, and its refreshing to see it in a Star Wars movie. 4. Luke\\, Leia and the old guard - this is not their time\\, they had their time and won their battles\\, defeated the empire. This is about the next generation who has to fight their own fights. Luke and Leia do have their moments\\, but they passed the baton. 5. Luke's death - he went the way he wanted\\, one last look at a double sun (like during his childhood on Tattooine)\\, content and in peace after doing a great deed. 6. Rebellion just about wiped out - key message here is that rebellions may be extinguished but they never die. Even if only few are left. There are real life historical instances where leaders with only a few followers rose to become leaders of countries. 7. New Generations (of Jedi) - even as the new generation of Rey\\, Fin and Poe fights\\, new younger kids (without great backgrounds just like Rey) who will fight the next battles are already showing potential for being future rebels and Jedi. Love that last scene. Key take from Disney is there will be no end to the Star Wars saga because there is no end to a life saga\\, and I like that.","true":true}
