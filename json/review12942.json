Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'd love for the haters of this movie to tell us what some of their favorite films are\\, because it makes very little sense to hate a movie for being fun\\, refreshing and completely respectful of the well-established lore of Star Wars. TLJ is amazing.","true":true}
