Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"we start with rebels blowing up a empire battle cruiser so straight away you think what's the point of this film then a glimmer of hope\\, the empire can now track the rebels going through hyperspace and catch up with the fleeing rebels but wait the rebels can keep just far enough away from their foe so their force field is effected enough to stop the empire's blast cannons (so why doesn't happen in all the battle scenes). The rebels have a cunning plan\\, they can sneak onto the empires multi billion pound state of the art battle cruiser and disarm this tracking device with the help of a world famous code breaker\\, so Finn sneaks off to find this guy without the Empire knowing (remember they can now track them through hyperspace but can't track Finn leaving the rebels ship to get help).  In the meantime Princess Leia gets sucked out into space but fear not she suddenly knows how to use the force to pull herself into another  ship (not sure why she hasn't used it before) by this time l couldn't take anymore enough excitement for one day.
