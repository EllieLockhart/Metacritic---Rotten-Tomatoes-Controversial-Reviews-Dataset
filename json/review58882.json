The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"this game is **** amazing! it gets across the point the developers and writers were trying to achieve with the cycle of violence being broken through both ellie and abby (both in their own ways and along their own timeline). they way that each timeline intertwines is absolutely thrilling and such good attention to the way the game works\\, as well as the story overall. It\u2019s incredibly captivating and takes the players on an emotional journey\\, which proves to be one of the best i\u2019ve ever played\\, at the conclusion of the game when all the emotions rush back in and are re-emphasised. Many people may not like how the game ended because you spend this whole time fighting people only to not achieve what would be perceived as the main goal\\, and that is a valid thought\\, however if that\u2019s all you take away from the game then i\u2019m sorry but you fail to see what it really is trying to achieve because\\, like mentioned earlier\\, the goal was to END this cycle of violence. the ending proves to show ellie\u2019s contempt nature and how she has come to terms with both hers actions and joel\u2019s as she is finally able to move on from this hate and revenge and attempt to live a somewhat normal-we life to what she had been. Now back to joel\u2019s death\\, yes i do think it could\u2019ve been better detailed and more stretched out as he was such a beloved character\\, although i think his death overall shows his growth and how he acknowledges the wrongs he has done and he doesn\u2019t really need anything more in his life because he was ok with how most things played out. So overall\\, i think it\u2019s a really **** good game if your able to understand the depths\\, themes and emotions which are meant to be instilled and evoked. Solid work !\u2026 Expand","true":true}
