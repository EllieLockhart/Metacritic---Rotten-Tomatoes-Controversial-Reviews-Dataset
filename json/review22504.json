Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let me get this straight.  If you don't like this movie you are either a bot\\, troll\\, sexist\\, racist or alt-right.  Ok.\\n\\nHow about this movie stunk and left true fans upset?  No?  Couldn't be that\\, right?  \\n\\nMinor spoiler alert \\nI cannot understand how this script didn't end up in the toilet where it belonged.  Luke would have never acted that way!  No mention of who Snoke was.  Rey needs to be trained properly\\, not for 1 day.  The Rose character should never have seen the light of day.  Who is the new villain?  Kylo Ren?  Really?\\n\\nHow could anyone reviewing this script have thought that all of the heavy handed socialist\\, feminist agenda was ok?\\n\\nSigh.  Lifelong fan here going to lick my wounds.  Really cannot imagine caring at this point what happens.  I really never thought I'd say this but I'm done with the Star Wars Universe\\, at least as long as it's in Rian Johnson and Disney's hands.","true":true}
