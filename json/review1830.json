Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A semi-decent movie on it's own; however\\, as a Star Wars film it's just the worst. If you grew up loving Star Wars like I did\\, avoid this movie as it will ruin everything you like about the Star Wars universe.","true":true}
