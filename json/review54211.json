Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you are not a fan or a bandwagon fan of Star Wars\\, you might like TLJ for the CGI action scenes. \\n\\nIf you are a true hardcore Star Wars fan\\, you will be greatly disappointed. I can't believe I waited 2 years for a movie with horrible and pointless plots. \\n\\n\\\"Search your feelings. You know it to be true\\\" that TLJ is the worst SW movie ever made. The general public and bandwagon fans will never understand why. \\n\\nAfter watching this movie\\, I went through the 5 stages of grief: denial\\, anger\\, bargaining\\, depression\\, and acceptance. I've never felt more compelled to write my thoughts online before\\, but this movie disrespected the saga so much that I felt I had to say something. \\n\\nThere are so many reasons why I hate this movie. Many of those reasons have already been mentioned on numerous news\/social media sites such as YouTube\\, Twitter\\, Reddit\\, RT and etc. TLJ makes me not want to think about Star Wars and not excited for the next episode because there is absolutely nothing to look forward to. \\n\\nI won't tell you to save your money and not watch it because if you are a fan\\, you should have seen it by now. \\n\\nI will\\, however\\, like to sincerely urge all true Star Wars fans out there to please not watch this nonsensical movie more than once and not buy any DVD\/Blu-ray and merchandise. Good ticket and merchandise sales are indications for Disney that their atrocious scripts and formulas are appealing. \\n\\nTo my fellow Rebels\\, whining on the Internet will never help. The only way to let Disney know our frustration is to hit them where it hurts the most. The main reactor - Their bank account.","true":true}
