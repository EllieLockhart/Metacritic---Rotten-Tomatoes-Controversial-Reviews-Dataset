Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The high critical acclaim for this garbage of a film that ruined everything that is Star Wars is suspect. Disney is arguably the most powerful entertainment corporation in the world\\, and it makes me wonder if they have these critics on a leash... Look at the AUDIENCE score\\, and tell me what is more accurate - the actual consumers of the business product or critics that have strong connections with PR\/Marketing divisions of companies? Anyways\\, this movie\\, along with the suspect high acclaims\\, fake marketing\\, and the obvious politicizing of hard left wing ideologies ended my interest and love for the Star Wars franchise.","true":true}
