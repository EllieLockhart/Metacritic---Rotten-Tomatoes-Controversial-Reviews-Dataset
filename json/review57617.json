Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Tonal issues here and there\\, humour is sometimes inappropriate and Canto Bight subplot had a nice idea (changing Finn's character motivation)\\, but was unfortunately executed quite poorly. Nevertheless\\, rest of the movie is filled with memorable moments\\, we see amazing performances from both Mark Hamill and Adam Driver\\, cinematography is breathtakingly beautiful and story takes unexpected turns thanks to RJ's daring attitude towards it. Solid 80%\\, good movie\\, but definitely not flawless.","true":true}
