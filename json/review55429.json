Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"* Maverick helps destroy a battleship that would've killed them despite orders to the contrary\\, gets demoted\\, then mutinies against a Feminist Cabal consisting of Space Mary Poppins\\, Vice Admiral Dangerhair\\, and Sidekick Bigschnozz. Later they regain control and forgive him\\, no biggie.\\n* Token Asian Woman heroically rescues Token Black Man from heroically rescuing the entire Resistance force. They then share a kiss\\, having bonded over trashing a casino while fleeing from parking maids.\\n* Darth Emo and Female Neo try to turn each other\\, but fail.\\n* Jet bombers work in space apparently. Also\\, the simple technique of hyperspace ramming has been discovered so from now on all space battles will be exceedingly short.\\n\\nAnything else I missed?
