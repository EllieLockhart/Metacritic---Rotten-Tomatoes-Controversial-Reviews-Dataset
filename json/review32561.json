Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi has so far proved to have been perhaps the most divisive entry in the franchise to date. This\\, however\\, came as a huge surprise to me as I came out of the cinema with a huge smile on my face\\, humming the music and thinking about how long the next two years will be until we see Episode IX. While it may suffer from a long run-time\\, thrown-away plot-points and just about edges on a bit too much comedy\\, this is an excellent and incredibly enjoyable chapter of the biggest sci-fi saga out there. Big\\, bold and exciting with brilliant characters\\, shocking story developments and beautiful action scenes\\, this is the Star Wars film we needed. Forget the haters\\, the force is strong with this film\\, one of the greatest Star Wars films yet.","true":true}
