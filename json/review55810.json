Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poorly written\\, completely destroys anything worth moving forward in regards to the story that was being teased through the first one in TFA.  Aside from it being a very bad movie\\, awful injection of SJW propaganda\\, it has ruined any reason whatsoever to look forward to the last movie.  Mary Sue hrm I mean Rey has already beaten Kylo Ren\\, there is no more threat besides the military force that is the empire or whatever they are calling it now.  New order?  Last order?  Best its just the forgotten order.  Forgotten is what this movie needs to be.","true":true}
