Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to love it and enjoyed many of the sequences. However\\, the negatives ultimately dragged this movie down to 5th place for me\\, behind Empire\\, New Hope\\, Jedi\\, Force Awakens and Rogue One\\, and before the awful prequels. Below is what worked and didn't work:\\n\\nWorked:\\n-Showdown between Rey\\, Kylo Ren and the Elite Praetorian Guards\\n-Kylo Ren who continues to be one of the best \\\"bad guys\\\" ever. Adam Driver does a fantastic job.\\n-Poe\\n-Laura Dern as Vice Admiral Holdo\\n-Chewy not eating a porg\\n\\nDidn't Work:\\n-The tremendous amount of useless plot which made the film far longer than it needed to be. The casino and search for the super hacker were a complete and utter waste of time. The story between Finn and Rose was equally worthless. The story line around the command ship keeping its distance before running out of fuel lasted entirely too long. The parts with the slave kids didn't seem to serve much purpose other than to set Disney up for sequels. Luke drinking the green milk straight was also a waste.\\n-The use of Luke. His character was the opposite of how he acted in all previous films. The use of his Jedi powers at the end to fight\/fool Kylo Ren was far fetched\\, and Luke's demise was a poor send off. Instead\\, Luke should have raised his X-Wing from the water and taken on Kylo Ren on the battlefield\\, similar to how Obi-Wan did vs. Vader. Overall\\, Rian Johnson and the writers wasted what could have been a great character.\\n-Other wasted characters\\, including Phasma and Snoke. Both died too soon and without enough backstory\\, particularly Snoke. Who is he\\, how did he rise to power\\, etc.?\\n-Rey was mostly irrelevant throughout the film with the exception of the battle sequences\\n-Leia floating through space like Mary Poppins was totally ridiculous. It defied both what we know about the Star Wars universe and basic physics.","true":true}
