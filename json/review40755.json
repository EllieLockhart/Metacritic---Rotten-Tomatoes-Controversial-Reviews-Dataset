Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This might have been the best Star Wars yet.  Both the heroes and villians were layered and complex.  No one was pure good or pure evil.  There were pure character moments\\, exciting action\\, and some unexpected events.  It treated women and people of color as being as interesting and capable.  I saw the original movie multiple times in theaters when it first came out.  I think I need to repeat that again.","true":true}
