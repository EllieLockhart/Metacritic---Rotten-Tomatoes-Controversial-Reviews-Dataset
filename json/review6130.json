Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney continues to ruin Star Wars. This was the most anticipated film of the new series for me because of the return of Luke Skywalker. The story paints the Jedi master as a failure and intimately kills him off like they did with Han Solo. There's no good storyline and the movie doesn't seem to have any focus with all the jumping around.  Smoke was a huge disappointment in that Ren killed him so easily (no master smith would go down so easily). Overall a pretty big disappointment.","true":true}
