Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"t is well shot and skillfully directed\\, I will give Ryan J that much.  In addition\\, the performances are all good to superb. However\\, if you are someone  for whom the original trilogy was a defining aspect of your childhood\\, or understand good filmmaking at a basic level\\,  I can't see how you can like this. It's not that the film is terrible\\, it's worse than that; it's just nothing. It's lifeless\\, awkward\\, politically correct\\, and utterly vacuous. It doesn't say or do anything new or interesting and\\, worse\\, it eschews not only the established SW universe but even the majority of the plot lines established in the previous film.\\nI gues it is its a \\\"fresh new direction\\\"  Like when we get to see the most hopeful and optimistic character in the SW universe\\, literally the only one who saw good in Darth Vader and managed to turn him to the light\\,  sense darkness in Kylo so............. he contemplates murdering the child of his best friend and sister in his sleep\\, then runs from the conflict and decides to become a hermit and shut himself off from the force\\, taking up the milking of alien sea cows and pole vault spearfishing.  One of the more loved secondary characters\\, Admiral Ackbar\\, was replaced by purple hair so that KK could have yet another strong woman\\, and Ryan couldn't even get that right\\, managing to have her inexplicably forget to mention her master plan to abandon ship and escape to the secret base so that we could have the secondary drama of Poe's Mutiny. Then there's \\\"no airlock required\\\" Mary Poppins Leia\\, Machine Gun BB-8 who can  also apparently tie up security guards  off camera\\, the 45 min of pointless casino planet\\, it truly is a hot mess.  What a shame that this is the direction KK has allowed the franchise to take. Any one of a hundred EU novels or even some fan fiction would have been better than this garbage.   Disney - you have unlimited resources - Put talented writers take control of the overall story progression and stop allowing kids who don't understand star wars from taking the series  in any more  \\\"fresh\\\" and \\\"bold\\\" new directions.","true":true}
