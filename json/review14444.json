Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had to register to this website purely for supporting this amazingly entertaining movie. I always say I won't rewatch SW\\, because I enjoyed them as a kid\\, as I have been less demanding viewer back then and I don't want to spoil all the good memories. \\nHowever\\, with this movie I felt like that content kid again\\, meaning it not only fulfilled\\, but surpassed my expectations. It was funny\\, touching\\, thoughtful\\, filled with good action. I like that the movie does not take itself too seriously as well.\\n I see that most of viewers have troubles with ambiguity - mostly regarding Luke. This is what I loved about it too\\, I thrive in moral ambiguity. Others are angry with \\\"Social Justice Warriors and feminnist propaganda\\\". Well\\, fuck those guys. \\nAll in all\\, everyone did a marvelous job. The only problem was pacing \/sometimes\/ and till the end it felt a bit lengthy\\, but that is just a trivial detail.\\nI have only one wish. Please\\, do not dumb down the sequel to cater to those who disliked the movie.","true":true}
