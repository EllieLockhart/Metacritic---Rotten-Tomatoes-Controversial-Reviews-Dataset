Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The message is clear: Let the past die. Like Luke said\\, did they think an old man was going to show up and fight the entire first order?  We need new Star Wars stories\\, not reliving the past.","true":true}
