Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly felt like a parody of a star wars parody. The most cliche ridden garbage trot I've seen all year. Complete lack of suspense\\, with the added bonus of nonsense with regards to the SW universe. The characters felt shallow and lost\\, as did the entire story. Pointless characters being introduced and focussed on\\, nonsensical plot points\\, and an utter disregard for the previous SW movies. Safe to say I won't be holding my breadth for the next one..","true":true}
