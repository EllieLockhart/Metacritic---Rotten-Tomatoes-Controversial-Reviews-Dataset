We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game is a masterpiece\\, and unlike any other game I've ever played.\r- Easily the most beautiful soundtrack\\, environments\\, world-building and graphics of any PS4 game.\r- Complex characters making flawed\\, human decisions makes for a gripping story.\r- The perspective flip to Abby took me by surprise\\, and nailed home the message that these people you're killing are the heroes of their own story\\, and that Abby and Ellie are two sides of the same coin.\r- There are a lot of lovingly crafted cutscenes\\, which enable character development which makes the pain raw and heavy when those characters are unceremoniously killed off.\r- Seattle is well realised - I spotted several buildings I'd been to! It's a shame they clearly weren't allowed to use the Starbucks name!\r- Holy **** every time I had to kill a dog or an enemies mates called out his name....christ. It's a bleak and violent world our protagonists live in.\r\rOverall\\, having completed one playthrough\\, I find it to exceed the emotional weight of the first game\\, improve on nearly every aspect of it\\, and truly made me agonise and empathise with the characters.\r\rI am a naughty dog fanboy\\, and this release only cements that further. I can't wait to see where they go next\\, but I feel like Ellie's story is done.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
