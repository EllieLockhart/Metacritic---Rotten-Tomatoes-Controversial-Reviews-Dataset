Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many plots made little sense\\, too much politically correct moments inserted into the movie\\, all for strong women\\, but definitely seems Disney has made it their role to make all the male roles into either stupid\\,greedy\\, cowardly\\, or grumpy. Whereas all the female roles are very strong characters. Which is fine. But this is Star Wars\\, not Star Princesses. A little equality amongst the gender roles would be better. Lukes character direction is a joke and his death made him feel like a throwaway character. The prior films build up of Reys parents and Snokes Identity was totally pointless. The whole casino planet to get a splicer to help save the resistance was pointless. ONLY TO HEAR ROSE'S GIBBERISH ABOUT SAVING SPACE PONIES BEING WORTH IT. The only good part of the movie is the opening space battle\\, to Rey and Kylo fighting together\\, to Lukes standoff with the AT-AT'S. Literally probably no more than 10 or so minutes of this movie is worth watching.","true":true}
