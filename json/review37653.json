Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There's a lot of condescending comments being thrown around that people who didn't like this movie just can't accept 'the new direction' taken with TLJ and are stuck in the past of traditional Star Wars films.\\n\\nThis as a Star Wars movie is the weakest of the bunch apart from Attack of the Clones and as a standalone movie\\, average at best.\\n\\nA fruitless plot\\, forced audience pandering humour and slapstick characters condemn what should have been an epic ending to one of the greatest characters in movie history.","true":true}
