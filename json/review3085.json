Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bad story telling\\, is disjoint from The Force Awakens and tried to hard to be something different. I have no issues with Luke dying or Snoke dying. But I have issues on why Luke decides to kill Ben as is not convincing\\, nor was how Be becoming Kylo as it was just due to Luke's igniting his lightsaber. Poorly build up\\, poorly done. Leia the mother of Ben does not come out of the ase to confront her son\\, what kind of mother in the world would do this?","true":true}
