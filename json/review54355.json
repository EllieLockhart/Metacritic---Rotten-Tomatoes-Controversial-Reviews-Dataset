Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It took a little while to fully grab me\\, and there were a couple weird technical flaws you wouldn't normally see in a major studio blockbuster. But 'The Last Jedi' just gets better as it goes along\\, raising the stakes constantly\\, and pulling rugs out from under the audience left and right. It was so refreshing to watch a film of this scale that wasn't predictable or formulaic. I can't say whether or not I'd want to watch it again\\, but I had a total blast seeing it in theaters.","true":true}
