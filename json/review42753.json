Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was horrible. I don\u2019t understand why anyone is giving it good reviews. The story made very little sense and when it did they just used the exact same dialog from previous movies. I want my 2 hours and 35 min of my life back please. ","true":true}
