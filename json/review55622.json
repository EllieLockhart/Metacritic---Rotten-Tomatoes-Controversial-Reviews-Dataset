Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"NOT SPOILER FREE and lacking enough VITRIOL to express my DISAPPOINTMENT. The Last Jedi should be renamed The Last Star Wars Movie You'll Probably Want To See. Thanks a lot Rian Johnson\\, you've ruined Star Wars for me. I could not be more surprised by my total lack of excitement to see another Star Wars movie. I just do not care. My 12 year old understands what made Star Wars great better than you. Of all the things you got wrong...how could you portray Luke so terribly? Did you see any of the other movies? Episode I was better than this pile. So you have Luke contemplate killing his nephew\\, really\\, after he tried to save the second most evil man in the universe. Kylo would be super easy to read... everyone knows he's conflicted. Luke the beacon of hope in every other film is castrated in this piece of $. You really think he'd try to kill his kid nephew?! Really?? You're an idiot and your movie is a terrible mess. The Casino Scene\\, Everyone is Special-No One is Special\\, Spaceballs Chase Scene\\, out of place Monty Python scenes\\, Leia from Krypton....this movie is just awful. Our only hope is this pile of garbage you've created is a lame dream sequence. May the Force just leave you...","true":true}
