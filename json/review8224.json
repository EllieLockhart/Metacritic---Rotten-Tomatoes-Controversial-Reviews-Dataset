Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic special effects and many parts of the movie were great....however\\, has the director seen episodes 4-6?! They understand the character development that Luke already went through? Have they seen the movies?! Because Luke Skywalker\\, the hero of the trilogy\\, was still an immature\\, scared\\, and un-jedi like character as can be imagined.  Great job ruining his legacy.","true":true}
