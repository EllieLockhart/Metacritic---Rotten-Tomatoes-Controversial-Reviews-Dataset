Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was shocked to see that this is one of\/the highest rated Star Wars movie. I'll give a list of some spoiler-free pros and cons.\\n\\nPros: All of the returning characters from Episodes IV-VII do a great job (especially Mark Hamil). Furthermore\\, there is a scene in a space battle that left my theatre silent\\, it was visually stunning.\\n\\nCons: I did not find any of the new characters compelling (especially Laura Dern's character). There are just too many missions and plotlines that I do not think go anywhere (Finn's journey especially). There are also far too many lucky coincidences (character's getting saved at the last minute\\, surviving while everyone around them dies\\, etc.). Also\\, there are far too many cute animals in this movie\\, it honestly gives the impression that they are trying to sell toys rather than make a good movie. Finally\\, there is a scene at the end that starts as amazing and showcases the true power of one of the characters... only to totally disappoint.\\n\\nOverall\\, this is a Star Wars movie that I would put above the prequels but below the originals\\, Rogue One\\, or Episode VII. I hope they do a better job with Episode IX and the upcoming Kenobi movie.","true":true}
