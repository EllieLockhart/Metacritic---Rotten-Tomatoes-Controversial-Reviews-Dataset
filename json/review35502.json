{"101487":175062,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi had some great scenes\\, and at times I felt really gripped by the story. Then in the middle of a good scene\\, something was done or said that made little to no sense\\, and I lost any sense of immersion or care for the characters. Hoping for a re-edited \\\"Director's Cut\\\" or something similar when it arrives on Bluray.","true":true}
