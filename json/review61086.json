ND should be ashamed of themselves and should be sued for that false advertisement. This is the main reason why I give it this score\\, I was manipulated by being told by the developers that this game would be something that it is not. Here is the complete list of reasons why I gave it a score of 0:\r\r-> The game not being what ND marketed it as\r-> The story seems like a rushed out draft at best\\, not even making sense on some occasion\r-> There are many plot holes in the story\r-> Turning the characters we've become attached to in TLOU 1 into idiots\r-> The explicit intimate scenes (I don't want to watch sex while playing games\\, this was absolutely unnecessary)\r-> Unnecessary d r u g s use scenes\r-> The important amount of unnecessary swearing between Dina and Ellie (which takes Ellie's innocence away and make her lot less likable)\r-> The intense kissing scenes between Ellie and Dina (A game is not the place for that. And I would make the same argument if it was a man and a woman kissing\\, I just don't want to see that kind of stuff when I'm playing a game)\r-> The SJW Agenda\r\rI was so hyped for this game. For 7 years now I've been dreaming about the day this game would come out\\, I was so hyped and excited for it. ND and Neil Druckman have crushed this hype\\, and it seem to have been their objective all along\\, making us hate this game\\, hate this franchise and hate this company. Well done.\r\rND missed a great opportunity of making a masterpiece. Instead\\, they completely ruined this franchise.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
