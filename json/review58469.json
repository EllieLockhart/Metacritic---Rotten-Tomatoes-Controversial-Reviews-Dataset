Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Alone the Movie is watchable and I would give it a 8.0\\, BUT with the Story of 7 Episodes before this movie is just one NOGO! It ruined every interesting aspect that Ep7 build. (Rey Origin\\, The Return of Luke\\, the Fight Luke vs. Snoke).\\n\\nEvery real Starwars fan would made a better movie out of this: Snoke being secretly a returning Imperator Palpatine would make more sence thatn the whole Plot of this garbage. 1 out of 10 as StarWars Lore fan.","true":true}
