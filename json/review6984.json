Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily the biggest and best Star Wars since Empire. I didn\u2019t initially like it\\, feeling like it dashed my preconceived notions of what Star Wars \u201cshould\u201d be about. But in reality it has always been about the failure of Hero Myths to deliver true and lasting peace. Every Jedi and Sith has failed to live up to the ideals they pledge from an excess of arrogance and self-interest. Star Wars is a revolution story and this movie finally makes that clear.
