Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An OK movie at best\\, and not worthy of the Star Wars brand (though obviously better than the prequels). It's like the director had never seen a Star Wars movie before. Classic elements like Blaster battles\\, lightsaber fights\\, and dogfighting take a back seat to a meandering and pointless plot and Rey's training with a surly and whiny Luke.","true":true}
