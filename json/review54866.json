Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a good film\\, but as it's very predictable and formulaic\\, I never really found it exciting or awe-inspiring.  Sure the locations and the cute little characters have changed but the tempo of the plot and the concepts are all so similar to what has gone before.  The music\\, presentation and special effects are great\\, but the lightsabre battle was lacking and some of the acting and dialogue was weak.","true":true}
