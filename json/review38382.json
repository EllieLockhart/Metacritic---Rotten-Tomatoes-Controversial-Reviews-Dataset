Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst movie I've ever seen waste of 2 hours. I saw it on the Thursday opening night and I have not watched it again since and I never will. As a Star Wars super fan this movie was a slap in the face. Any movie fan could easily see even from a non Star Wars perspective this movie didn't make any sense. It didn't connect to the last film at all. Rian Johnson literally threw away the script JJ made for 8 and made whatever he wanted. This movie destroyed whatever foundation The Force Awakens created.","true":true}
