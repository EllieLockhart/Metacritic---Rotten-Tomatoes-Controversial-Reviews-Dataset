Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"LUKE THROWING THE SABER AWAY SUMS UP THE CARE FOR STAR WARS FANS BY DISNEY...Bitterly dissapointed - the heart of star wars has been wrenched out - whats the story with turning star wars into a cross between harry potter and thor ragnorak - oh yeah.... they made money - not everything is about money.  I think they may havr played a game with fans and done the opposite of expectations for ep8 and then they will do the same for ep 9 ie try to patch it up??  I mean its like they came up with the plot over a coffee break.","true":true}
