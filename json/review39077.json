Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This ambitious title tries to reinvent the Star Wars genre and fails. As a generic movie\\, it's not awful. But as a Star Wars movie\\, it's not good. there are many character changes in this film\\, specifically Luke Skywalker that is present and ruins his character while making him unlikabke. Along with that\\, the rules of space are defied as there is now apparently gravity In space as seen in the opening scene of the film. Overall\\, it didn't feel like a Star Wars movie and seemed to fail on all of the exciting parts that were left open in the last movie. Disappointing","true":true}
