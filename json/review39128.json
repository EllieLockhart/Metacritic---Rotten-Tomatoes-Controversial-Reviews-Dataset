Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This didn't feel like Star Wars at all. The characters were way off. The dialogue was forced. The humor was stupid and completely out of place\/touch. The villain reveal was anti-climatic. I blame the writer\/director for all its short-comings. I hope they find someone else for the next installment. This one was way\\, way off. A huge opportunity squandered.","true":true}
