Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Watching these new Star Wars films is like having a beloved family member's corpse resurrected and programmed to say a handful of things they used to say...it's not the same\\, it's depressing\\, and it's insulting in a way. The main creative forces behind Star Wars - George Lucas\\, Gary Kurtz\\, Marcia Lucas - have nothing to do with these films\\, they are just simply the fan fiction by the most privileged people in Hollywood (whoever Disney chooses to helm the franchise)...so they get to claim credit for something they never created and parade around their pandering mess of a film to the entire world with the foregone conclusion that we'll all love it and we'll all continue to buy Star Wars merchandise until everything from our dish towels to our underwear to our wallets say STAR WARS.\\n\\nI'm surprised most reviewers are being as kind to this film as they are. Even if the original films didn't exist for comparison\\, this new film would be a baffling\\, rambling\\, incoherent mess. There's too much going on\\, none of it very Star Wars\\, most of it just 2017 blockbuster or Marvel\\, all of it for a pointless rehash of nearly the same conflict in the first OT that somehow doesn't matter now (the Empire vs. the Rebels).","true":true}
