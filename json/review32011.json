Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers (Duh)\\nLaden with inappropriate and poorly timed humor\\, dripping with disgusting mercantilism to sell toys\\, and filled to the brim with pestilent political themes of the so-called social justice warriors\\, The Last Jedi is a cash grab by the Disney Corporation that betrays all fans of the previous installments to make way for the upcoming generation of thoughtless consumers.\\n\\nFrom the callous discardment of the most iconic lightsaber in all of the Star Wars mythos\\, to the prank call made by Poe Dameron to General Hux\\, I began to ask myself if this was a student film as scene after scene played out in the most eye rolling\\, cringe worthy\\, and anti-climactic fashion imaginable. \\n\\nEvery moment in this film is built up to a climax that is promptly crushed leaving the viewer disappointed and questioning why they even spent the money to enter the theater in the first place.\\n\\nFirst\\, we need to talk about the most iconic character of the film\\, Luke Skywalker\\, who is reduced to a shadow of his former self and seeks to strike down his apprentice Kylo Ren in fear and desperation due to seeing darkness within him. This is the greatest betrayal of Luke's character\\, and sloppy writing\\, as we clearly saw in the original films Luke was staunchly dedicated to redeeming his father\\, Darth Vader\\, from the dark side to restore balance to the universe.\\n\\nSecond\\, the film builds up a moment between Ren and Rey where it is soon to be revealed who Rey's parents are. The audience is clinging to their seat waiting to hear that she is from a strong lineage that links the two together\\, but that is destroyed as it's revealed that Rey's parents were nobodies that sold her to pay for alcohol. Whomever thought this was a good idea in the writers meetings should be disbarred from involvement in the film making process for all eternity as this moment was perhaps one of the best scenes in the entire film\\, but was slaughtered by abysmal writing\\, and betrayed all the groundwork laid forth in The Force Awakens.\\n\\nThird\\, the film has far too many political themes that leaves a sour taste in the mouth. Most men in the film are reduced to fools\\, or are members of the Pseudo-Third Reich\\, First Order\\, and portray the \\\"evil\\\" roles in the film. The women are portrayed as being virtuous\\, all-knowing\\, and always pure in their decision making process which not only is a betrayal to real women who want to see a female character grow by learning from their mistakes\\, but also a betrayal to the children watching the film that learn the ideology of gynocentrism which portrays women in a holier-than-thou light.\\n\\nOverall this film was of poor quality\\, and with so many furry creatures flooding the screen in an obvious attempt at grabbing cash from plushie\\, and toy sales it deserves to be far lower in the rankings than it currently is due to its force fed mercantilism. \\n\\nAt least half of this film could have been cut as many of the sub-plots bare no everlasting effect on the finale of the film\\, and instead are strategically placed as a way to promote social commentary about interracial relationships\\, gynocentrism\\, and so-called social justice philosophy. When a viewer goes to see a film they do so in the hopes of being entertained and seek to leave the film in an elated mood\\, they do not attend a film screening to have political ideology shoved down their throats masked in a Star Wars coat of paint.\\n\\nI'm giving this film a 1.5 \/ 5.0 as there were several good scenes in the film with high quality visual effects\\, but other than that I will not be purchasing this film when it's released\\, nor will I be watching it again. I'm also struggling to have any interest in the upcoming film and final installment in the new trilogy due to Disney's clear ability to mismanage the franchise. George Lucas should purchase back his franchise before Disney destroys it any further.","true":true}
