Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great movie; fast paced; engaging with core fans and everyday movie-goers.\\nIndeed\\, there may be one or two moments which might pull you out of it but at no point to they affect the plot. \\nIt's fluid in terms of continuity. rich in visuals and texture\/feel. \\nThis was a high degree of difficulty job and Rian Johnson lived up to the expectations. \\nMaybe all these elements are not as discernible for everybody\\, but they are present in the movie and enrich the viewing experience.","true":true}
