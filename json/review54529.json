Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I made a rotten tomatoes account just to warn others how much I hate this movie. Kathleen Kennedy has already pushed the PC agenda with the force is female crap. Honestly\\, Im ok with Rey being a girl. But Star Wars should be for everybody. And lets be real. Nerdy men made this film famous. I bought all the toys and video games as a kid. My sister bought backstreet boys albums.\\n\\nThe movie however threw the successful formula Lucas created out the proverbial window\\, and tries very hard to forget all Lucas Created. It literally and figuretively kills all you know about the 6 real star wars films and gives the classic \\\" if you are not with me\\, then you are my enemy\\\" sort of feeling. \\n\\nIf you however like men to be pointless idiots or douche bags when women are unrealistically powerful and not relateable characters\\, meanwhile you like gotcha moments every 5 minutes\\, then this film is for you... but you probably arent a real star wars fan and your taste in movies suck and you probably should buy this film along with the 2016 ghost busters along with Grease 2 as the shitty film remake trilogy.","true":true}
