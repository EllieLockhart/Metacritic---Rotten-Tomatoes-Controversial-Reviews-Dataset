Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was terrible.  Please get JJ Abrams back fast.  On top of the plot holes people have brought up it was just cheesy.  Sorry but Mark is not a good actor.  Really bad.  I understand why they didnt have him talk in the last one. That bad guy snoke looked like a cartoon character.  The movie felt like a cartoon and it was long.  There needs to be some elements of realism in these to get people other than 5 years olds engaged. Barf. I felt cheated watching this. Rian should make childrens movies for pixar or something and stay out of mythology.","true":true}
