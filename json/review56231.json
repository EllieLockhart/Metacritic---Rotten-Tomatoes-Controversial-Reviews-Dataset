Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star wars The last jedi is a mess. The plot was just all over the place and completely contradicts the lore of star wars\\, even more by setting up mysteries in the previous films only to giving you scratching your head with its answers\\,  plot holes are there\\, character backgrounds is not explained\\, \\n\\n\\n\\nin the end im very worried with the next installment with how much a problem this movie gave to the next director to helm the next film\\,the only thing i could say mark hamill was right.","true":true}
