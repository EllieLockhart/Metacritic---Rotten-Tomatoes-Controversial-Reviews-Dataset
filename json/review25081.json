Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nearly perfect - it was action packed\\, funny\\, quirky\\, endearing\\, sad\\, hopeless and hopeful ... and best of all it was largely unpredictable.  \\n\\nI absolutely loved it and can't recommend it enough - especially in IMAX.","true":true}
