Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's like re-booting The Empire Strikes Back\\, but with different actors. All the elements of the TESB are there: Hoth but with salt instead of snow\\, the death of the Jedi master and the Jedi order dying with him\\, etc. But this time\\, with plot holes and inconsistencies everyone described in detail. How do rebel soldiers enter a casino without a toxedo any security guard problem? This movie doesn't add anything. It even removes the legend of the previous.","true":true}
