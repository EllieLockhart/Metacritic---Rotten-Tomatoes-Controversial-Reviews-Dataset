Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By far the worst movie of the Star Wars Saga. The movie is long\\, but fails to spend that time wisely. Instead it attempts to accomplish too much through attempting to tell three disjointed plots\\, all of which meet the protagonist with failure\\, that never allow characters to develop. Rian Johnson completely abandons what made Star Wars such an interesting and beloved franchise that spans over four decades.","true":true}
