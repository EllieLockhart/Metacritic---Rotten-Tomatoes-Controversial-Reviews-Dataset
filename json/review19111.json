Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's hard to vocalize my biggest problem with this movie without revealing spoilers so I will speak generally. I really disliked The Force Awakens\\, I felt like it was a shot by shot remake of A New Hope\\, going in to The Last Jedi I had higher hopes and boy was I disappointed. There are some cool scenes in this movie and some great visual effects but the story is all over the place\\, half the movie is set in space with the rebels\\, in reality we want to see Luke and some of the other characters. Disney completely reinvents what Star Wars is and makes it about blasters and space ships and lasers and completely misses  the point and misses good moments to address a few things from the last movie and to really show more Jedi\/ Sith concepts. I thought it was worth seeing it in the theater because its a Star Wars film\\, but if you are going into this movie thinking you will be blown away than you will be disappointed\\, it doesn't feel like a star wars film at all.","true":true}
