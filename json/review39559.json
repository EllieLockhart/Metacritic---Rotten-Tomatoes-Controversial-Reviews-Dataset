{"101487":181395,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was without a doubt\\, one of the most heartbreaking and disappointing experiences walking out of cinema screen I've ever had. I've been a SW fan since I was about 6 years old and I simply can't communicate clearly how upset this film made me.\\nI want to just spell out why I personally found this film so very disappointing. Now\\, I have a lot of problems with it\\, including things like badly written and misplaced humour\\, some patchy acting\\, a very forgettable score\\, inconsistencies with established lore\\, a completely forced and contrived intimacy between Rey and Ben\\, and so on\\, but they're minor issues\\, and besides\\, other people have already talked about them at length.  Here are what I think are the three biggest issues I have.\\n(1)\tTaking Risks vs. Killing the story. There isn't anything wrong with wanting to make changes and to be 'bold' and take 'risks' - all of these things should be applauded. However\\, you shouldn't confuse taking chances with bluntly ending storylines for no good reason other than to shake things up and start anew. Love or hate TFA\\, what JJ Abrams did do was reintroduce us the SW universe and start to develop some new characters and plots\\, and the film ended leaving many of them left open for someone to come along and do something interesting with them. What Rian Johnson has done is take all the threads that JJ had left open and just unceremoniously and prematurely killed them off (literally in many cases) before they had a chance of growing into anything interesting\\, and then what's worse\\, not replacing them with anything else after doing that. I'm sorry\\, but that's not taking chances\\, that's bad storytelling. It's like inviting someone to get into a car\\, introducing them to other interesting passangers and telling them you're off on an exciting journey - only\\, you stop five minutes down the road\\, tell everyone to get out of the car and then just sit there staring at the wheel. \\n\\nRian wasn't starting this trilogy and he wasn't finishing it either - he had the task of taking what JJ had done and then doing something interesting with those things that keeps us wanting to stick around and find out where they lead in the final act. Now\\, the way TLJ plays out\\, JJ Abrams might not have bothered even doing the TFA\\, because anything left over from that film that could have been cultivated and formed part of a narrative leading into the final act\\, has been cut down before it could grow into anything interesting or memorable. You could essentially start a new trilogy from the next film and forget TFA entirely now. The ending of the film is basically a 'blank slate' for JJ to start again and that would be extremely refreshing at the end of the trilogy\\, but not in the middle of it when people were following threads that in total\\, are essentially the plot of the trilogy. SW films are supposed to leave you with pieces that you can play with and speculate about where they might go - TLJ leaves you with nothing and feeling that all the questions were answered too quickly so there's nothing left open to even justify making a third film. \\n\\n(2)\tRey  - Rey on her own\\, without any deatailed backstory or origins\\, is not a very interesting protagonist -there\\, I've said it. That's not just subjective either because even if Rey was a potentially more interesting character\\, you still need to tell her story. I hear that the revelation that she's a 'nobody' is the whole point\\, because that fits the message that anyone can be a hero and a Jedi\\, and that a peron's past is no guarantee that they will be a great hero ( e.g.\\, Kylo Ren) or amount to nothing (e.g.\\, Rey\/ 'Broomboi'). That's a very good message and I would support it\\, but no protagonist ought to be a 'nobody'. Even if Rey was dumped by her junker parents and that's all there is to her then that's still a potentially interesting story and I want to see some of that\\, because if you set a character's backstory and origins up\\, then you deepen that character as a real flesh and blood human being and make them something worth emotionally investing in. Rey should not be a 'nobody' - she should be 'Rey the Jedi who was orphaned and dumped by her parents' and at this point in this trilogy we should know a lot more about that. As of the end of TLJ\\, all we can say about Rey is she's a nice person with noble intentions who exists as a metaphysical counter-balance to Ben Solo's growing darkside powers - that's it\\, she's just 'there' effectively. That's not very compelling and it doesn't deepen or broaden her character - she's not much more than a plot device. \\nThat leads me to the revelation of Rey's parents which acts to close down questions about the protagonist rather than build them up\\, with result feeling extremely anti-climactctic. If you're going to make some big shock reveal about a character\\, then do something that opens up possibilities and so creates potential plot. By introducing Rey's parents as nobodies and emphasising that their unremarkabless is the whole point about Rey's character\\, this hasn't done anything for Rey and her part in the plot. In TESB when we find out that Vader is Luke's father\\, that created questions which finally formed the plot of TROTJ (Luke's accepting his parentage and seeking out his father to save him as a result of this revelation\\, is really the TROTJ is its essence). What is there to take from this revelation which you can use in the final film? There's nothing really\\, other than Rey attempting to redeem Kylo Ren again which we've already done. \\n(3)\tThe Skywalker Saga - Disney (and by that I mean Kathleen Kennedy and Bob Iger) have stressed that they believe that these episodic films should be (and are) considered the 'Skywalker Saga' and that they're about a family and a 'disfunctional family' at that. That's what episodes 1 to 8 are about - the generational story of a family. This central thread and the characters that have grown with it over a long period of time\\, is what ties all of the films together and along with that some themes have emerged such as legacy\\, destiny\\, family\\, loyalty\\, choices\\, bloodline\\, prophecy\\, and so on. If this all adds up to anything\\, I'd say each trilogy is about a generation of the family learning about their past and the legacy handed to them and then exploring the moral choices they make with this. Anakin is born with a legacy - he is the Chosen One and a prophecy hangs over his head\\, Luke is born the son of Anakin Skywalker\\, the man who failed to complete the prophecy and fell to the darkside and Luke must make a choice about what plays in this legacy handed to him. Each generation of the family learns about what comes before\\, they experience how the past shapes their destinies\\, and then the story is about some sort of moral choicethey must make as part of this continuing legacy. That's it in a nut shall - that's SW: The Skywalker Saga. \\n\\nHow does TLJ leave this continuing saga? Well\\, Rian has consciously decided to bin it and basically invent his own themes. TLJ is about how charcaters should not be defined by their family and their past and that you should destroy the past if you can. That's fine on its own and there's nothing wrong with that theme\\, but you can't call this a family saga unless you emphasise about how the past is important to the protagonist - that it's about knowing your heritage and your place in that story. That leads us back to Rey- she's not a Skywalker and she's the central protagonist in the Skywalker Saga. That means it's very difficult to see where the Skywalker family can go from here. You can't really call this a Skywalker Saga if there's no one who's actually called 'Skywalker' in it anymore and no protagonist who bares that name and carries that legacy. You can't hold out your hopes for Ben - he's never going to be a worthy heir to the Skywalker name even if he were to be redeemed. He's damaged goods. Having Rey be a completely new character is fantastic but don't introduce her in a family saga where she doesn't fit then. Let Rian Johnson have some fun with her in something completely new. As it stands\\, at the end of TLJ\\, the Skywalker name and legacy has basically been dumped and seeing as that family and its legacy is very emotionally associated with this continuing story\\, I have to say that I can't help but feel the films have lost something very cherished by fans (including myself) in the process.","true":true}
