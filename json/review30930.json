Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointed in how the writers disregarded the threads opened from 7\\, disconnected it from the history and the behavior of the characters\\, dragged on. No amount of amazing special effects and good action can save this failure.","true":true}
