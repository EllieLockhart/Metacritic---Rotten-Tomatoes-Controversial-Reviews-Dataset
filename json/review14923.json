Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just can't figure out what people see in this. As a stand alone movie it would be fine. 3\\, maybe 4 out of 5. But as an eighth installment to a saga\\, this falls flat. REALLY flat. At this point what is the purpose of episodes 1-6? Uncreative art design\\, the plot goes nowhere\\, and an ending that feels like the ending of a saga rather than a third act. How the hell are the \\\"good guys\\\" supposed to win outside of a lazy deus ex machina? Very disappointed.","true":true}
