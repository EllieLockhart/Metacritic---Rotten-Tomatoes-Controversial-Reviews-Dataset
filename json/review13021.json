Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don\u2019t get what all you do \u2018so called Star Wars fans\u2019 are moaning about. You got your action and your quality. So what Disney own Star Wars - it means more funding for a die hard franchise that TRUE FANS will love and support no matter what. I personally LOVED this film. It\u2019s definitely a step forward in comparison to episodes 1\\,2 and 3 as it explores the future of our beloved characters - **SPOILER** yes Luke dies\\, but this had to happen in order to create a plot that could be carried through to the next film. Besides just because he\u2019s dead doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s gone. After all they killed off Yoda in episode 5 and we still continue to see him in future movies. Therefore I can argue this to be one of the best movies of the year and a MUST SEE!!!","true":true}
