Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's as if Rian Johnson chose NOT to watch The Force Awakens\\, then went online to read fan theories and thought...\\\"Hmmmm\\, F*** them!\\\". The mysteries\\, suspense\\, and potentially brilliant story arcs created by The Force Awakens were squandered in this poorly written attempt to create something new and memorable. Rian Johnson has officially dethroned George Lucas as the king of cringeworthy dialogue. And the jokes... my God\\, the jokes. With the exception of the first scene\\, that contained some humor\\, the rest of the jokes came off as being crafted by a focus group of sixth graders.\\n\\nJJ Abrams has a huge task ahead of him to turn this dumpster fire into a launch pad for the 9th installment.","true":true}
