Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First off\\, I'll start on a positive note. Here's what I liked. This film had stunning visuals with an amazing blend of CGI and real world effects where sometimes it became difficult to tell what was real and what was CGI. The musical score was the best since the original trilogy as well. On those two points alone this film is probably worth watching once.\\n\\nWhere this film falters though is its storytelling & plot. There are way too many interesting plot points from the previous movie which were never explored\\, as well as ones within this movie itself that were just plain ignored and thrown out. Some character development from the first movie weren't even touched upon. There was no Finn & Poe camaraderie. Both of these characters were merely just a punching point for two dreadful & poorly written characters. I won't even go into what they did to other pre-existing characters in the Star Wars franchise that made little to no sense. At least they didn't mess with Yoda.\\n\\nIf this film were any other franchise it wouldn't have been held to such a high standard. There are some points that would make this movie worth watching - but very few people will want to watch it even for a second time. I'm not even sure how they can get past this to make episode 9 work - they'd pretty much have to retcon this entire move.","true":true}
