Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the best film I've seen in along time. Being a huge fan of star wars it's self\\, TLJ really showed what star wars is. To new and old fans of this amazing saga\\, watch this movie. It's nostalgic and just an awesome movie. It reminds me of Empire and ROTJ in so many good and amazing ways. Please see this\\, you won't regret it.","true":true}
