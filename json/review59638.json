Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Note : I am not giving it a 10 to balance out the bad scores.\r\rThis game is incredible on many many aspects. The gameplay feels so\\, so good. Every weapon is very satisfying to use thanks to the sound effects and the gore. The ability to dodge is a good addition.

Every weapon is very satisfying to use thanks to the sound effects and the gore. The ability to dodge is a good addition. The sneaking works very well with the added ability to crawl and different ways of going through the environment. The puzzle phases are so much better than in the first game and more diverse with the ropes\\, the jumps\\, all the windows you can go through. The maps are much more open (at least during the first half of the game) with a lot of things you can easily miss if you go in a straight line (pretty much every weapon and upgrades can be missed). The ambient music works really well to raise the tension. The facial animations combined with the acting make every character look so real\\, you can read everything on their faces. The accessiblity options also are unrivaled. To sum it up\\, everything is really\\, really good and if you liked the first game I don't see how you can dislike this one based on everything I just mentioned.\r\rNow\\, for the controversial aspect\\, the story. It is incredible. However\\, the game does not go easy on you. At all. Prepare to be upset several times. That said\\, the hard parts are there for a reason and not for shock value. They make sense. And they make more and more sense the further you go in the story\\, and take into account every character's motivations. The story in itself is simple but emotionally complicated\\, a lot more than the first game's that is very straightforward. If you haven't read any spoiler\\, the better because ouf of context any story can look bad\\, hell the first game's story can hold on a post-it note. Around mid-game\\, something happens. If you can get over it and just enjoy the ride\\, you will love this game. The second half of the game probably is my favorite part because of the weapons you have and the environments you go through as well as the dialogs.\r\rI am sorry to say it\\, but I think that a lof of hateful reviews are left by people that are either not emotionally mature (the game is supposed to be 18+ remember ?) \\,or mad that this game's story is not what they wanted\\, or they just decided that they hated the game before they even played it. So\\, go for it\\, make you own opinion and I think that you'll see that the game is incredible. Probably my GOTY.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
