Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This felt more like Guardians of the Galaxy than Star Wars\\, except Guardians had a much more likable cast\\, clearer motivations\\, and jokes that actually landed. More importantly though it seems like this movie was going out of its way to push away the original fans and make the original movies pointless in hindsight from the way Rian and Disney treats the world of Star Wars and it's greatest iconic characters with borderline disdain. Overall if you're just a casual fan of Star Wars or don't really like the franchise to begin with\\, you'll have some fun with the decent action and visuals. If you hold the star wars saga and especially the original trilogy close to your heart\\, I'd recommend to steer clear of this movie to preserve that optimistic feeling from the ending of Return of the Jedi.","true":true}
