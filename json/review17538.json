Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I siGNED UP JUST SO I COULD REVIEW THIS AWFUL MOVIE. HATE HOW THE COMPLETELY CHANGED LUKE SKYWALKER'S PERSONALITY. IT NO LONGER HAS ANY CONTINUITY. ALSO\\, YODA ONLY ACTED LIKE A GOOFBALL BEFORE HE REVEALED HIS TRUE IDENTITY TO LUKE--THAT WAS A COVER\\, A DISGUISE! HE SHOULDN'T BE ACTING LIKE A GOOFBALL AGAIN. SUCH A DUMB MOVIE. GAH\\, I HATE IT.","true":true}
