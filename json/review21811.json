Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just dissapointing overall. This movie doesnt manage to develope interesting characters which you care about.\\nIt feels as if Ryan Johnson did not understand what made the OT so great. This movie lacks the Magic of what made Star Wars legendary. It also goofes Characters like Luke skywalker and wastes every potential it had. \\nIts just painfully unfunny and when its funny its mostly unwanted and uncomfortable to watch. It has some Great scenes but too few of them and the rest of it feels like unessecary junk. Its not as bad as TPM and AOTC but not even close to the OT.","true":true}
