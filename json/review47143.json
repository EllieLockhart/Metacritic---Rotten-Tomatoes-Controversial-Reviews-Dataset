Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a massive disappointment this movie is. It repeats so many of the errors of the prequel trilogy\\, but makes things much worse by ruining the legacy of beloved characters from the original movies. It does not feel like Star Wars. It has too many characters\\, it is too disjounted and long. There is too much humor and interest poorly placed. It introduces and discards too many heroes. This is not what Star Wars is and Disney must course correct.","true":true}
