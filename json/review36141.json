Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi was a poorly written mess. It reminded me of the walking dead in that all the drama and tension is achieved because characters don't talk to each other and it seems like they actively avoid simple conversations that would completely fix or end the movie. The story literally does not move forward at all from the end of the force awakens.  I really wanted to love this movie\\, but someone could skip this movie and only need a short star wars opening crawl to catch up: Luke dies because he used the force to hard\\,  Snoke was killed by Kylo because reason\\, and the rebels and first order are exactly where they were at the end of force awakens except now the first order is run by Kylo who I'm not even sure is a bad guy anymore or what his motivation even is. Oh and Rey is a nobody but can do whatever the plot needs her to do because plot armor.","true":true}
