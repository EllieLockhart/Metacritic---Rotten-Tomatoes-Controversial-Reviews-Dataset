Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was ok\\, my kids enjoyed it. I guess that is what matters?\\n I feel like they don't even know what story they want to tell anymore - and they are figuratively and literally destroying the old universe just to ram new characters and stuff down our throat\\, without anyone even caring about them. HEY KIDS forget star destroyers buy a dreadnought toy! Hey kids buy rebel bombers! Here are some cool new action figures! I get it Disney...I dont think Disney does though. If Poe Dameron wasn't in these\\, it would be hard to watch\\, that's the only new character with real personality.","true":true}
