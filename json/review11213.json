Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly I loved it. I'm a pretty big nerd\\, and often find myself disappointed in movies that try to build out from a successful franchise. \\nWhat I liked;\\nIt stuck with the look and feel of the Star Wars series\\nIt had humor but wasn't a running gag\\nCharacters had depth - no one is fully good or evil\\, and we find that good can create evil as much as dark can create light.\\nHope and a change in regimes are the focus - which is refreshing. It allows for a new direction.\\nI love Rose. \\nThe visuals were epic.","true":true}
