Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a lifelong fan of Starwars so I was thoroughly looking forward to this episode-especially after enjoying the last two outings. I thought the opening scene was poorly handled-the humour wasn't welcome-it just undermined the Empire and felt like a Carry on Film...I just deleted a huge rant. There's too much wrong with this film and it certainly didn't serve the life long Star Wars fans well. Gutted. From the ratings\\, I've also lost confidence in Rotten Tomatoes' critics.","true":true}
