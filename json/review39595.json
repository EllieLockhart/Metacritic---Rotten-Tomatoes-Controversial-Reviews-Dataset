Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This flick was a cash grab of a train wreck. Almost as bad as the prequels but terrible enough to warrant not wanting to see and skipping out on Solo. Still on the fence whether to even bother with ROS. TLJ really cemented the tarnishing of this franchise's legacy. What a garbage dump of a throw away flick and such a wasted opportunity. There was potential for this trilogy to have been a masterpiece. Even with a director\/writer's lack of creativity and imagination\\, there was such a wealth of material to pool from that any Hollywood hack should have been able to come up with something decent. The plots in fan made youtube videos are better. Oh well\\, at least we have the rare fluke that is Rogue One. Star Wars is dead.","true":true}
