Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I created an account (as many others have) just to leave my comment here.\\nI agree with most of what has been said already by many critics. It's not worth repeating.\\n The movie was awful for reasons already mentioned.\\n\\nMy only wish is that it's not only talk\\, but also action\\, i.e. that people stop paying money to see Disney's Star Wars movies.\\nAs long as Disney makes money out of Star Wars\\, they will churn out sequel after sequel or spin-offs.\\n\\nIt is fine and commendable that fans voice their anger and frustration about Disney and Star Wars\\, but what really\\ncounts is to resist to seeing these movies. Otherwise\\, it is really only thin air.\\n\\nAlas\\, my feeling is that a lot of people are only bragging that they are finished with Star Wars\\, but don't have the guts to pull through with it.\\nThey will be back\\, commenting here in two years again: I didn't like the movie or even hated it\\, but I saw it three times anyway. \\n\\nI am a big believer in open\\, free markets. If people went to see Star Wars and paid\\, then they liked it just enough that it was worth their money.\\n\\nIt doesn't much matter if trolls are manipulating the ratings here one way or another. What is relevant is what people actually do and not what they profess to do here\\n at rottentomatoes.\\n\\nTherefore\\, if you didn't like the movie\\, stop your complaining and whining\\, and don't be hypocrite. Simply stay at home. The market will do the rest.\\n\\nOnly time will tell if all the negative comments here are overblown. It might only be a very vocal minority and a lot of hypocrites (maybe myself included).\\n\\nIt would take a lot of convincing to get me back to the movies to see another Star Wars film. It's possible\\, I guess\\, but very unlikely. As far as I can tell\\, I am done.\\n\\nI give this movie half a star\\, notwithstanding the claim it won't count. Please give proof to the claim that only one star reviews count. Otherwise\\, it's only a meaningless rumor\\n with nothing to substantially back it up and give credence to.","true":true}
