Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi doesn't hold up well in terms of Hollywood story or Star Wars continuity. It does bring something new to the saga\\, in the same way that Transformers 4 brought a fresh type of garbage to a dying franchise too. I know that\\, as fans of the original films\\, you will see the movie like I did. However\\, you will either regret it or find value in the warm embrace of the nostalgia that is so powerful because the old films were so much better than this one.","true":true}
