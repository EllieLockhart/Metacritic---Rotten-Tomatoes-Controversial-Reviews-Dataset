Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson has transcended the usual Star Wars formula to make a film that\\, while it may not stand on it's own (it is the second of a trilogy after all)\\, stands above the rest as an achievement of what to do when given a franchise entry\\, and I hope more follow in his steps.","true":true}
