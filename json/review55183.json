Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wish I could give this a big fat 0 stars. I can't believe people are giving this more than 1 star. It sucked really bad. The Star Wars series was just killed in every way possible. I'm a life long fan and they shot themselves in the foot. The Force Awakens was bad enough the way they killed off Han Solo. At least let him save a planet by flying the Falcon into the planet death star or something along that line. Still sick from the experience. Pissed off fan here.","true":true}
