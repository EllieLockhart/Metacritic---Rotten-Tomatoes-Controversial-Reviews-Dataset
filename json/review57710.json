Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unholy crap. That movie goes nowhere with its story or characters. It just throws a lot of characters into the dumpster of stupidity. It skips all the interesting struggle of Luke that could have motivated his new self\\, and could be interesting. Vice versa it spends a lot of time with a supposed mental struggle between Rey and Kylo that you feel neither connected to nor does it produce any tension. With all the largely nonsensical \\\"twists\\\" you don't feel anything but anger at how much they could have done and how much they screwed up instead. Yes it looks nice\\, nice effects is what money can buy quite reliably.  Most character actions feel script-forced rather than character driven.","true":true}
