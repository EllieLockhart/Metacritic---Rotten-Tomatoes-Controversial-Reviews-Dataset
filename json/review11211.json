Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly I just don\u00e2(TM)t understand how people can enjoy this movie. Even if you gloss over the the massive plot holes surrounding the bombers and Leia\\, how can you not think about the waste of characters such as snoke and Luke.\\n\\nFrom Reys parents being nobodies and rose being a useless character who has literally no place I. The movie\\, I really don\u00e2(TM)t understand how someone with an iq of above 3 can like this movie for its plot!","true":true}
