Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Contrived\\, irritating and crammed with forced comic relief\\, The Last Jedi is emblematic of what happens when a studio is more concerned with a product than an artwork\\, and appears to serve no purpose aside than setting up so-called \\\"twists\\\" that don't so much subvert expectations as they do undermine everything Episode 7 created.","true":true}
