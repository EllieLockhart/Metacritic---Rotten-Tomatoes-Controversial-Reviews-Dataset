Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I understand why some Star Wars fans may be disappointed with this film. I consider myself a fan and as a fan I will say that although I expected something a lot different from this movie\\, I am also pleased to see that they\u2019re taking risks as well\\, some stronger than others. My biggest distaste comes from the comedy which at times felt forced\\, however we are given a lot of interesting themes and intriguing plot points to look forward to in episode 9. Instead of hitting the same beats as always\\, we get a deeper look into elements I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d go into depth with. It was suspenseful\\, it was daring and it was a damn fine movie. I applaud Rian Johnson on taking the hard task of making \u201cA Star Wars movie\u201d which these days seems quite impossible. Not everyone will love this movie and I can tell it\u2019ll be debated amongst fans for years to come but please do go see it\\, I think there\u2019s loads to unpack with this film. ","true":true}
