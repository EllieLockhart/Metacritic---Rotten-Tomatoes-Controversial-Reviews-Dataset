Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2(TM)s really sad how many people really hate on this when realistically it\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2(TM)s a very enjoyable film. I love Star Wars\\, have since I was a kid\\, and I really enjoyed this - it wasn\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2(TM)t as good as Rouge One but definetly and equal to \u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2~The Force Awakens\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2(TM) - a few scenes didn\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2(TM)t quite work (the casino planet\\, Leia surviving in space) but I was prepared to stretch my belief as the rest of it more than made up for these weaker elements. Kylo Ren continues to be excellent\\, Luke was amazingly portrayed as always and I\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2(TM)m even more excited to see how this trilogy rounds up. Here\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2(TM)s hoping for a bad-ass Rey in episode 9.","true":true}
