Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When the movie is good\\, it\u2019s amazing. However\\, in the same vein\\, when the movie is bad\\, it\u2019s really bad. Main arc grips you\\, side arc leaves you waiting for what feels like forever to go back to the main arc.","true":true}
