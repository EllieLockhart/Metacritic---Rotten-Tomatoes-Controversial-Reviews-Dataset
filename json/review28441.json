Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"pretty bad movie\\, not even 1 lightsaber battle\\, too many stupid jokes\\, too many furry animals to sell as merchandise later on\\, very very few interesting things that matter happened leaving a sour taste in your mouth after waiting the movie\\, that goes hand in hand with too many sub plots happening at the same time leading nowhere\\, with very intereting characters with very small screen time.","true":true}
