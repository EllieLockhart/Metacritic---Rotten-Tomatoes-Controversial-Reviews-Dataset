Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've seen it twice and loved it. Loved the growth of the storyline\\, the parallels of how people respond to abandonment and loss\\, and that in the end\\, when faced with the same decision--choices are what define us.","true":true}
