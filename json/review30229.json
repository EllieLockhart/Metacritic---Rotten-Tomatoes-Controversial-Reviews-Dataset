Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw it.. will see it again and again. I went to the theater as a kid to see the original Star Wars when  they first premiered . This left me with the same emotions I had then. It's a New Star Wars world but building on the old. It's a fun ride. No it does not go how you expect... that's what I love they didn't  make my Star Wars movie they made a great one that continues to expand the universe. As fans we must unlearn all that we have learned so that we can learn the new.\\nDon't listen to the negative go see this fantastic Star Wars movie and have fun. It's Star Wars people! I have been there since the beginning I am a huge fan","true":true}
