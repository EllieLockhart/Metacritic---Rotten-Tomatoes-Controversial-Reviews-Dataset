Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went in feeling this had the potential to be one of the best Star Wars movies because of the tremendous potential of the material and actors. But this movie left me disappointed in a way that no other movie ever has. \\n\\nI could go into deep details with my issues like many others have but I'll keep it simple. The humor was constant and more often than not forced. Some of it works well (BB-8\\, Cooked Porg) but the vast majority of it would've been left on the cutting room floor of a Spaceballs sequel like Luke Skywalker Grand Jedi Master milking a CGI water giraffe.  \\n\\nBut my biggest issue was the hyperspeed kamikaze maneuver that took out Snoke's ship. Why oh why didn't the Rebels think of that two Death Stars and a Starkiller Base ago? It was a dumb subplot to begin with but that was the horrible cherry on top. I get this is Star Wars and reality is suspended more often than not but this was an unforgivable oversight. \\n\\nOverall I feel The Last Jedi confirms the Marvel-ization of the franchise. Disposable villains\\, cliche humor\\, heroic poses\\, and pathetic character development doomed this movie and leaves the entire franchise in creative trouble. I know it'll make a billion dollars but this movie could be the moment that Disney begins to kill the golden goose.","true":true}
