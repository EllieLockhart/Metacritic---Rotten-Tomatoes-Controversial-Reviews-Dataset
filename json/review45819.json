Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very poor story telling and actually DESTROYS the Force Awakens. Making the entire trilogy SUB-PAR.  Wasted characters both Old and New.\\nNo proper continuation from TFA.","true":true}
