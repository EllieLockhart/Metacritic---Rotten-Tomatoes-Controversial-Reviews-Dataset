Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably like everyone here im a starwars fan growing up watching all the movies and waiting for the new ones to come out...there are plenty of OMG moments in there as they introduced new things but i feel like some scenes could have been completely removed and  some scenes it seemed like they were trying to push some type of forced message on the audience which kinda which made me cringe but probably just the character development of characters annoyed bit like some of them seem like they have a key role but end up being nothing which disappointed the most espically the new characters it seems that luke outshines everyone esle in this film but you hardly get know much...some nice moments in the film which i did enjoy but overall i left the theatre a bit meh","true":true}
