Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Wizard of Oz in space with a little Mary Poppins thrown in for no discernable reason - Finn wants courage\\, Poe wants a tactical brain & Rey realises she's not in Kansas anymore! Enjoyed it at the cinema\\, but the plot holes\\, misteps\\, mistakes and elements that messed with the original constraints of the universe have tarnished the Star Wars legacy more than any prequel ever did.","true":true}
