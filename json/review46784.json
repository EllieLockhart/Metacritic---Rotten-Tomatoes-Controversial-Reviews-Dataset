Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well\\, fuck. That was unfortunate. Writer\/director Rian Johnson's 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' is a failure in pretty much every way but one: it succeeds in making George Lucas' prequels look genius by comparison. 'Member in 'Empire Strikes Back' how the story got into the Star Wars characters more and revealed deeper facets to all of them? Yeah\\, I 'member. That doesn't happen here. No sacrifices. No consequences. No payoffs. No balls. Just a bunch of idiots magically stumbling their way out of one crisis after another for no apparent reason. Where the story could have veered off in interesting ways to challenge its characters and the audience\\, it doesn't. Apparently\\, fighting and war is bad and all it does is make the 1-percenters rich\\, but if we save what we love and don't sacrifice anything at all\\, it'll light up a spark and all will work out in the end -- just 'cause. Star Wars by idiots\\, for idiots.","true":true}
