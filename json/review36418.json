Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The most disappointing movie-watching experience I have ever had. Essential\\, central characters were neglected\\, and a couple were even wasted. An anti-climactic finish. Central to the theme was the idea that everyone can be special and powerful just because and that they don't have to work for it\\, (contrast Rey's virtually non-existent training to the apparent weeks or even months Luke spent on Dagobah between episodes 5 and 6; also contrast Luke's struggle to balance and use telekinesis under Yoda's training to the stable boy's natural ease of using telekinesis with the broom.) The two messages of this movie were; (1) \\\"let the past die. Kill it if you have to\\,\\\" even if the fans love it. (2) Buy Disney merchandise kids! BUY!!!!","true":true}
