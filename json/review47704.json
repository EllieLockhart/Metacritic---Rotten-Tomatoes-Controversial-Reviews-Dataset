Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When I left the cinema the whole experience was weird\\, Nobody said anything and seen silent faces leaving the theater. I wasn't sure what to think as my brother hasn't said anything . So I asked after a while a long silence. \\\"So? What do you think?\\\" And he said \\\"Utter shit\\\". After these words I was so relieved as I thought that I was the only one who disliked the movie. Now I understand the facial expressions on the faces of people who had nothing to say when leaving. Very Disappointing movie.","true":true}
