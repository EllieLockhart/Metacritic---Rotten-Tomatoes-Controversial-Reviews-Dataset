Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is definitely one of the better and more interesting chapters of the main Star Wars Saga. I think the toxic side of the fanbase really missed out on this one. It has a ton to offer and if you enjoy Star Wars on a wholistic level\\, there is so much here on offer. The worlds look great and feel real. The characters grow and the plot threads feel lived in enough. There are two aspects of the film that I don't enjoy\\, for one the battle tactics on Crait make no sense and the battering ram laser was not terribly inspired. The comedy is perhaps the other aspect that I felt miffed by\\, but even that really is Star Wars. Han Solo in the first star wars did a prank call gag during the Death Star escape and Poe does the same here. For me\\, I am fan of the Star Wars IP\\, the whole thing. It is very fun for me. The emotions\\, the action\\, the droids\\, the aliens\\, all of it. It is fun. What isn't fun are the fans to need these movies to be more than that\\, the fans who needs Luke Skywalker to save them. This movie honestly addresses that culture head on\\, and it says what those fans hate\\, that there is more to life and living that watching Luke Skywalker save the day and his Dad.","true":true}
