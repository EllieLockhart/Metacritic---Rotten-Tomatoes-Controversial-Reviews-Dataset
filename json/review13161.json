Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't mind films that you take your brain out to enjoy\\, but TLJ is a film pretending to be serious while giving an aneurysm to anyone with a pair of functioning brain cells. I also understand the need for contrivances to drive a story\\, but this is nothing *but* contrivances and they're not just unlikely\\, they're internally contradictory.\\n\\nThe characters are terrible. The story is dull as rocks. The humour isn't funny. No-one is heroic. No characters are relatable. It's like two hours of really bad memes thrown together with no understanding of storytelling.\\n\\nThis film picks up none of the threads left in TFA and it leaves none of it's own for Ep.9... save possible 'where did the ausience go?'","true":true}
