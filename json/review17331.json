Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wish there had been a clear direction for the new StarWars reboot\\, the only thing I enjoyed in this movie was the Kylo\/ Rey dynamic.  There was way too much comedy for my liking in this movie\\, it feels like the villains are always the butt of some joke that isn't funny .  Luke Skywalker's character was completely butchered. Snoke a previously intriguing  character is gone \\, making him completely irrelevant . The movie wasted a great deal of time introducing new characters such as Rose\\, DJ and the purple haired lady instead of developing the current ones. The plot itself is boring \\, 2 spaceships chasing each other through space at a snail pace. Fan favourite Captain Phasma barely got 5 minutes of screen time.  I really hope the next movie takes better care of this beloved franchise \\, because this movie was just disappointing.","true":true}
