Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite what the haters say\\, Luke Skywalker's actions are quite in character. This movie has taken not only his character but also Rey and (very much) Kylo Ren in interesting directions.","true":true}
