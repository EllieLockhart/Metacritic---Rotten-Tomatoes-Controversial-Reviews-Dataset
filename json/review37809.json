Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were multiple points in this movie where I had to remind myself that this is an actual Star Wars movie and not a strange and surreal fan made disaster. This didn't feel like a passionate project pieced together by creative minds that had love for the series\\, but instead a low effort installment cranked out by Disney and shipped off for a quick couple of bucks.","true":true}
