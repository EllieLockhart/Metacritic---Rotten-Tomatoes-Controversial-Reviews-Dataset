Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A worthy addition to the SW franchise. I am getting ready to see it a second time because there is so much going on - but and the end of the day\\, it is one of the best post-OT films made!","true":true}
