Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I sat watching it struggling to think of a comparison\\, then it hit me (I think It was during one of the five or six times the film could have decently ended). It is Quantum of Solace - an expensive\\, noisy incoherent and disappointing follow-up to a powerful and effective re-boot. I've got no objection to the way it busted expectations and laughed at all our pre-conceptions. I just object to it being a never-ending parade of illogical piffle. And what on earth was the point of that whole \\\"master codebreaker\\\" nonsense? Is Rian Johnson a fan of \\\"Setting Free the Bears\\\"? I hate to say it\\, but the whole film had a nasty spell of prequel about it.  Its worth one star for effort\\, but that's it I'm afraid. I think I'm done with Star Wars now. It's been a fun 40 years but everything has to end sometime.","true":true}
