After the game is released which is 19 june 2020 around 12 am i started playing continously in 22 hours which takes two days this is what i am thinking after i finished the game and fyi i played the first part it was 9\/10 for me sometimes the mechanics was grumpy in part 1\rso last of us part 2 i dont know where to begin in 1 hour and 5o minutes my favourite character is dead so found my strength and anger to kill who is responsible is. The character development is 100% garbage why i am saying this hear me out why after joels death ellie who we are playing is hunting abby i was able to play with it i was commited to it but when you play as abby things turn around which is naughty dog  trying so hard to make what abby did  was right that is my basic conclusion\rwhy i am saying this because you cannot play hero and villain thats how life works in real life  you included in same game maybe a dlc but i dont think my opinion is changing even after that playing abby was like they are trying to prove a point most people would hate it because you are playing as villain here which you guys trying so hard to make what abby did was right there is no character development the only character development i see here is joel but he is dead in the start of the game ellie she is same for me but letting go abby even after everything you did to get to this point. The way i see its waste of time to play the game you letting go the killer who killed your father aka fatherly figure. For me the game ends after joel death other things happening are just collateral damage if she didnt go for revenge jesse will be alive \\, dina wouldnt leave ellie which she will at the end of the game\\, tommy would be with his wife. Like i said its collateral damage more people dying whom you know and the people are getting hurt whom you know. So playing as abby she is the real winner because she get what she wants but which cost her friends life which i dont care anyways. The people saying about lgbtq issue but i dont care about it anyways thats not issue for me only thing i liked about the game is graphics\\, gameplay which it didnt win over me except the stealth part crafting and the other stuff i felt its just the same like part 1. So people who are thinking of buying dont buy now wait for like 5 or 6 months cost will be way less just like death stranding thats wait for it thats how i bought and played for 15 bucks worth it kinda whoever played this game giving review like 10 out of 10 means mostly they are fake just think for a minute even after everything i played it do you ask me it was worth it i would say 40% percent because hereafter any game naughty dog releases i would wait for a while which i should have done in the first place for tlou 2 just out of curiosity i bought it and i am not happy about it\u2026 Expand","true":true}
