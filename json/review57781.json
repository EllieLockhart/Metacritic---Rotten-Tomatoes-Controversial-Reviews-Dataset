Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning and builds on established characters and conflict while leaving room for more to come. \\nI was completely drawn into the world\\, and while it had its clumsy moments it stayed true to the source and the core message is a powerful one. \\nI was a kid again for two and a half hours. \\nLoved it.","true":true}
