Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars\\, The Last Jedi. Takes the franchise in some new directions. Some positive\\, others negative. There are some incredible moments\\, that peak as some of the greatest in franchise history. Two times the theater I was in gasped with excitement. There are also some low points. While they aren't George Lucas Prequel bad. They are a low point for the Disney era of Star Wars. The film is a bit too long. With a runtime of over 2.5 hours\\, there were scenes that could have used a bit of trimming down. It also appeared that the writers wrote themselves into some corners with the previous film\\, The Force Awakens and didn't know quiet how to fix it. But if you go looking to have a good time\\, I don't think you'll be disappointed.","true":true}
