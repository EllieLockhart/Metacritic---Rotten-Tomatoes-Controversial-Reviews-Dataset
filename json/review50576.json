Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"2 stars for the acting and directing in this movie but that's as high as I can go. The plot was a mess at times\\, throwing out some interesting and exciting characters JJ set up in the last one. The middle part of the movie dragged nearly sending me to sleep and some parts even reminded me of episode 1. The humour worked at times but otherwise was a cringe worthy experience which made me think I was watching some other movie. \\n\\nTheir are some highs in this movie but unfortunately\\, for me at least\\, the lows take up the most part. Hopefully JJ can fix a lot of the issues left by Rrian Johnson but for some characters and arch's\\, the damage is done.","true":true}
