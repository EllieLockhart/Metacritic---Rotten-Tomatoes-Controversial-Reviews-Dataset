Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Definitely had its flaws (Weak\/poorly timed comedic one liners\\, questionable pacing\\, etc.)\\, but the core message and critique of the force as a whole made this a much more interesting Star Wars movie for me. Dynamic characters are something that was sorely missing from much of the series for me. The Last Jedi helps to develop one-dimensional perspectives into something that I find to be much more satisfying.\\n\\nMy main anxiety going into this one was that they weren't going to develop any concepts enough to keep the story interesting. 7 was more of the same\\, which I was okay with for the start of a new trilogy\\, but I was worried 8 would carry on in that same vein. I now don't have that fear going into 9. (Assuming Abrams rolls with Johnson's storyline here)","true":true}
