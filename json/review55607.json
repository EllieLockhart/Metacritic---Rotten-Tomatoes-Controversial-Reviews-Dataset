Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No\\, this movie did not kill your childhood\\, nor is it a flawless masterpiece. The Last Jedi tugs in both directions at points\\, but it deserves respect for trying something new in the Star Wars universe\\, but every time the film is remarkable\\, there is an equally trivial and stupid scene.","true":true}
