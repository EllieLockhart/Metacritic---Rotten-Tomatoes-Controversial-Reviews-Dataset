Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the movie was enjoyable with some nice moments I was overall disappointed with the movie.  No real revelations were made to any of the major burning questions such as who is Snoke (and now he is dead)\\, where did the First Order come from and how are they more powerful than the Empire even though the Republic had won along with many others.  I did not like how Luke was portrayed in the movie and his death was anticlimactic.  The worst scene in the movie was when Leia became Space Ghost Leia and floated back to the cruiser after having been in the vacuum of space\\, just silly.  Overall they are not honoring the Star Wars universe and it makes me very upset.  Rogue One did a much better job of keeping the true Star Wars tone and feel.","true":true}
