Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Being a huge Star Wars fan....\\n\\nThere is only one way to describe this movie. \\n\\nA HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT \\n\\nSo many plot holes\\,   new force powers that make no sense\\,  actually....   There are quite a few surprises in this movie that make no sense. \\n\\nHow does Disney hand my beloved Billion dollar franchise to a director that let him do whatever he wanted.   It was like a big F U to the fans\\,  the story that JJ started....    We are left with a pile of heaping garbage for JJ to fix in Part 9.","true":true}
