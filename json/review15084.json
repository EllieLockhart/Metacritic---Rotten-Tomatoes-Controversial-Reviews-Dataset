Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left the theater thinking \u201cwhat the hell was that\u201d. It\u2019s like the Johnson hadn\u2019t even seen previous Star Wars films and was given a brief overview of the premise and universe. I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s signed on for 3 more! All the buzz articles I read had me really thinking this would be the masterpiece I\u2019ve been waiting for. It was worse than any of the prequels! Everything was either taken to the extreme or just cast off as inessential. There was nothing in between. It seems like so far it is really polarizing but I\u2019m on the end of the spectrum that thinks Lea shouldn\u2019t all of the sudden have the ability to live in the vacuum of space having suddenly tapped into her massive force abilities. So dumb. The crystal fox and Chewy were cool. ","true":true}
