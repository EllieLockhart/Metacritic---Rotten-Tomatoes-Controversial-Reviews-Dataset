You the player take control of various characters\\, and in turn have to make choices that will impact who survives in the end. It's a pretty straight forward story akin to 1980s slasher films.\rThe game's biggest strength is the voice work turned in by the actors. Although the dialogue is at times cringeworthy the delivery is done well by most of the cast. The other thing that stands out in this game is the visuals. The game looks downright gorgeous at times\\, and it maintains a solid frame rate throughout the experience.\rThat however is where the positives end. Truth be told I have a hard time calling this a game at all. It is more of an interactive movie where sometimes you get to walk around\\, and sometimes you get to make a mundane choice. This could possibly be forgiven if the game had any significant scares in it\\, but the only this this has going for it in terms of scares are the thousands of jumpscares it throws at you near the end. I was expecting good things from this for the fact that it was an exclusive\\, but what I got was an extremly dull\\, and at times boring experience. Something no gamer wants to go through while playing a game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
