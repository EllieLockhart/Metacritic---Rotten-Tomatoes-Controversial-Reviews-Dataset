Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it. TFA was really a rehash of ANH and everyone knows it. It was good and I am glad it got the job done and rebooted it all. I think too many went into TLJ wanting to see certain things and then feeling let down when they didn't get what they wanted. I put TLJ up there with Rogue One and Empire. It was dark where it needed to be. Very much so but that is what the story needed. It needed darkness for the story to advance. The director took risks for sure but this is one I am still thinking about after watching two days ago as I did with Rogue. I didn't give much thought to TFA afterwards.","true":true}
