Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It\u0092s a good film overall. The fx are amazing and the acting is top notch. Just the pacing and story are all over the place. The film is basically two in one. The first order chasing the rebels through space makes no sense as a plot point but it does cause Finn and rose to go on a side quest. Rey goes to try and get Luke to train her but he\u0092s lost the will to do anything which was boring to me. Some weird stuff happens in this film Leia flys using the force and Snoke is just killed off. I don\u0092t think people are mad cos it\u0092s too different. It\u0092s because we were set up for some interesting questions that had unsatisfactorily ends. We wanted Rey to be someone\\, we wanted snoke to reveal his past and see how he manipulated Ben from Luke\\, we wanted more forceback reveals\\, we wanted the knights of ren\\, we wanted Luke to ignite the green lightsaber and kick some ass\\, we wanted Rey to be tempted by the dark side and maybe be this grey Jedi\\, we wanted benicio del toro to be someone better than a cameo\\, we wanted to first order to actually be a competent enemy not just looking the fool every film","true":true}
