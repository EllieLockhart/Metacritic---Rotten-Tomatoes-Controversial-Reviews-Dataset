Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yes\\, it had its problems. I'm not alone in my dissatisfaction with the Finn and Rose storyline\\, and I had some problems with their choices regarding Luke Skywalker's character. But it also had all the elements that make the Star Wars franchise one of my favorites. Moral delimmas\\, epic space battles\\, catchy dialog\\, and great characters. I'm hoping they'll iron out the rough spots in the next installment\\, butbin the meantime\\, I'll be watching The Last Jedi 30-40 Times.","true":true}
