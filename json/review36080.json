Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi truly is an outstanding movie. It makes you think\\, and delivers twists and turns that you would never expect. As a massive Star Wars fan I was very happy with this film. You must keep an open mind and remember that it\u2019s not going to go the way you think\\, and that\u2019s ok. Love the original trilogy\\, but remember that this story is vital for the future of the narrative to take Star Wars in the direction that it needs!","true":true}
