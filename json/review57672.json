Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"trash\\, they added plot lines that made no sense\\, Luke was extremely poorly developed and they do what ever they make up new things with the force that are not supported by any other aspects of the star wars universe. just a mindless Disney cash grab.
