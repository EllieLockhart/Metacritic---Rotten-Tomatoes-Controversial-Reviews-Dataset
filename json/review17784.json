Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It feels like Disney\/Lucas Film are actively trying to destroy this franchise. I am a huge Star Wars fan\\, and after seeing this movie\\, I doubt I will ever see another Star Wars movie in the theater again. This is a terrible movie and an embarrassing end to heroic characters that we have got to know over the last 40 years.","true":true}
