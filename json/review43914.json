Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Though the \\\"free the horses\\\" scene was boring and unnecessary\\, the rest of the film was quite enjoyable. Being an avid reader of the Star Wars \\\"Legends\\\" I was thinking I would be disappointed\\, but I actually felt that this iteration was entertaining\\, reminiscent of the Empire Strikes Back\\, and though not as good as the books\\, the film was so thrilling it is hard to see why it received so much backlash.","true":true}
