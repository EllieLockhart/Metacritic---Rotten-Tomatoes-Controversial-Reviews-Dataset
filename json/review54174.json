Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If not for the existence of movies like Logan\\, Wonder Woman or Blade Runner\\, The Last Jedi would rise indisputably as the best of the year\\, but this is not bad\\, because although it does not surpass them\\, if it joins the club of brilliant narratives and stories that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Star Wars: The Last Jedi closes an important cycle and gives way efficiently to the approach and establishment of the conflict that we will see resolved in a couple of years when episode IX puts an end to this trilogy. If you are a fan of the saga (and who is not?) You will get excited and you will get on a roller coaster of emotions: you will laugh\\, you will deny\\, you will want to applaud and you will even cry.","true":true}
