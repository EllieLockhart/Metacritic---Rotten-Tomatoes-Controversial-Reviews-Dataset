Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I created an account for the sole purpose of giving a review of this \u201cpoo doo.\u201d I really liked TFA and R1\\, so I\u2019m not trying to be a hater\\, but Wow... this movie is not good. It\u2019s better than E1 and maybe E2\\, and that\u2019s about it. I won\u2019t give details because I don\u2019t want to give spoilers. SW fans like me are going to see the movie regardless of the reviews. I\u2019m just very\\, very disappointed. Every line of dialogue is rehashed\\, the plot is pointless\\, there\u2019s a side plot that takes 30 minutes that could have been totally cut and nothing would have changed\\, everything felt very E1 (less Jar Jar). I kept waiting for a character to shout\\, \u201cThis is podracing!\u201d ","true":true}
