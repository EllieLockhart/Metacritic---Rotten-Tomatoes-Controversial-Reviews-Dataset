Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars the Last Jedi is able to create tense moments unlike any other movie I've seen in the past few years. Along with this\\, the character journey of Luke is astounding\\, as well as Poe's\\, Kylo's and Rey. While the Rose\/Finn arc doesn't shine as bright as the others\\, it still provides Finn with a very important growth in becoming a resistance hero. Johnson succeeds in many ways\\, with overall storytelling\\, character development\\, tension\\, camera \\nshots and more. The hype was well worth it.","true":true}
