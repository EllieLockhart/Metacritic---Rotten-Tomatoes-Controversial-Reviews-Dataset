Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An excellent installment in the saga. A fresh style\\, bold story\\, and excellent twists. If Rian Johnson is wrong\\, I dont want him to be right. Great movie.","true":true}
