Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While not perfect\\, this movie is definitely spectacular in its sprawl. It told a number of different simultaneous stories\\, teaching characters new lessons while developing the storyline towards the third and final movie of this new trilogy. It left questions unanswered\\, but also developed the characters towards the discovery of those answers\\, hinting at the key flaws in the characters","true":true}
