Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"More than anything\\, this movie's reviews show the power Disney has over critics and controlling the narrative around their movies. I had dismissed the complaints of DC fans saying the critics were biased against them and toward Disney\/Marvel\\, if only because the DC movies have been pretty bad. Now I have to wonder. This tomatometer score may be the best evidence for why Disney should not be allowed to buy Fox\\, that is an absurd sentence (which makes me like it even more).","true":true}
