Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow... completely agree with the audience reviews... this was a complete and utter disappointment. The fundamental flaw of the movie is that from Force Awakens to Last Jedi... there is not a consistent story. It\u2019s like reading a a trilogy that is written by strangers that only very rarely talk about the story and characters. And when I say rarely\\, I mean once in the whole time the trilogy was written. As far as the visuals\\, most are brilliantly done\\, expect the throne room... wow that fight sucked\\, felt very slow compared to phantom menace.","true":true}
