Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is so bad it made the prequels seem like masterpieces! Visually it is nice but the story is a mess of plot holes and it drops basically everything the Copy Paste movie Star Wars 7 setup. I was so sad I spent money watching TFA but it doesn't even compare to this! Lea is now a force user and apparently not able to die after being blown up and sucked out in space. Snoke is ridiculously powerful and the leader of the First order and also irrelevant and dead! WHAT!!! And Rey who isn't daughter of any one special beats imperial guards after only knowing about the force for a week!!! Kylo is just as powerful but had years of training isn't as good! Mary Sue!!! Finn and Rose dude plot was completely irrelevant and Rose saves Fiin because saving a friend is important.... but letting everyone gets blown up! Dumb shit! And they humiliated Mark Hamil by nerfing and murdering Luke! EVERYTHING IN THIS MOVIES IS HORRIBLE!!! NOT GOING TO WATCH ANY disney STAR WARS MOVIES AGAIN!","true":true}
