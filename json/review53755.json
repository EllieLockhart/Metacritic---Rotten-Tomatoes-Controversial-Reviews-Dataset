Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"good visuals horrible choreographed fights how do you just kill such an interesting character as supreme leader snoke without one hell of a fight just um yeah your dead bye all over the place too political horrible subplots and an absolute god damn travesty to Luke Skywalker to turn him into a shell of what he was and make him the grumpy old man waiting to die is atrocious alot of missed opportunities here very disappointed ","true":true}
