Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SJW political dumpster fire with a director that has no idea what star wars movies are or how things work  (bombs don't fall with no gravity). It's like watching michael bay movies\\, no story line but flashy explosions galore but with absolutely minimal explosions. Star wars was about amazing fantasy and story but this movie had none of that.","true":true}
