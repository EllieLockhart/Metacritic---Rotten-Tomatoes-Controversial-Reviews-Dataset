Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was visually stunning.  It was a good movie but as has been said many times\\, it was not a good star wars movie.  It is ok to go against expectation and try new things\\, but it is not ok to totally trash plot threads in less than a minute. If it was a stand alone movie then plot threads can be at the whim of the director\/writer.  This was supposed to be a trilogy and to have divergent directions in the story telling shows a lack of planning.","true":true}
