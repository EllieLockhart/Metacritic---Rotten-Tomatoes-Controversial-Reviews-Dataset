Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A little long and at times Disney's hand is very noticeable\\, but in this movie they put the creativity in the story that was missing from the previous one to give some interesting twists in the plot. It's Star Wars of pure strain. A lot of lightsaber\\, a lot of shots\\, the Millennium Falcon doing \\\"his thing\\\". They fixed everything they did wrong in episode VII.","true":true}
