Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"there was a lot to like about this movie\\, but it was about 30 minutes too long. all the scenes focusing on Rey\\, Luke\\, and Kylo Ren were great. the rest of the movie is so so. lose the casino scene and subplot\\, and the movie is a lot tighter and much better.","true":true}
