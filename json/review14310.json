Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I grew up on a steady diet of Star Wars and a lot that occurred in Rian Johnson's entry in the Star Wars universe would satisfy that child I once was... but nostalgia is a dangerous thing. With some satisfying cinematic moments throughout the film and amazing flight and battle sequences as well as a strong diverse cast The Last Jedi has good intentions\\, but this chapter is however ultimately underwhelming\\, relying on servicing fans by way of a contrived plot (\\\"You need a ship?\\\" \\\"Hey\\, look there's a ship!\\\" or how the sewer system leads Poe and Rose straight to the stables from the prison) that ends back where it started and where certain deaths are weightless and meaningless and where attraction is instant. It's good fun but will be a forgettable event in the galaxy far\\, far away.","true":true}
