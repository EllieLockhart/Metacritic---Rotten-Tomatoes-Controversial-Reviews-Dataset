Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a huge fan of Star Wars. Unfortunately\\, this is probably the worse of the series. This has been such a waste of my time and money. Please\\, save yourself and wait until it comes out on Netflox or just dont watch it.","true":true}
