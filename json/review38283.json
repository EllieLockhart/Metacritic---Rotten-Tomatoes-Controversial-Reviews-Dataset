Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worlds longest space chase. This movie is what happens when you fail to map out the direction you're going to take with a trilogy. If you remove Luke committing force suicide (or w\/e the eff that was)  this movie would feel more like a fan film of what could have happened between episode VII and VIII. Instead we get this trash pile that doesn't really serve to advance the trilogy's story line.  Which furthermore paints the direction of the trilogy into a rushed corner for Episode IX.","true":true}
