Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie makes a mockery of the carefully crafted Star Wars universe lore and internal consistency by introducing several problematic new uses for established mechanisms such as hyperspace travel and the force. This latest installment in the saga is no longer able to instill willing suspension of disbelief in me and my friends. Otherwise a boring and unremarkable movie with at times above average special effects. At least the force awakens was a decent ripoff of A New Hope\\, this a whole new level of bad.","true":true}
