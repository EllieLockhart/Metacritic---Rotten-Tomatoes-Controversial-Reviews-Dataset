Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've already seen it twice and its blown me away both times. The risks this film takes go against the expected tropes that this franchise has stuck to for its entire lifespan. Those risks pay off 100%. The yo-yo pacing kept my heart racing from beginning to end and the surprises were much appreciated. Outside of one segment on Canto Bight feeling a tad overlong and an unnecessary tag prior to the credits\\, the directions the lead characters take resonated and are unlike anything in the franchise. Unsurprisingly\\, this has displeased some fans as many I know personally (including myself) have theorized to no end about what would happen here. I personally LOVED what I got. Rian Johnson crafted not only an all-time great Star Wars film (4\\,5\\,8 for me)\\, but one of the best films of the year.","true":true}
