Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a magnificent triumph that kept me guessing the entire time. It's awash with nostalgia and familiar situations\\, but balances that beautifully with surprises that reinvent the franchise. Rian Johnson knew precisely what my inner Star Wars fan was expecting from this chapter and used those expectations against me\\, launching me headlong into one emotional barrel-roll after another and giving me the Star Wars experience I never realized I wanted. The egalitarian thread that runs throughout\\, and culminates in Rey's big reveal\\, allowed me to connect to the Star Wars universe even more deeply than I realized I could\\, and made that universe feel even bigger than it did before. I shrieked with laughter at the reference to \\\"Hardware Wars\\\" and seeing the helmet with the blast shield down subtly placed as a background prop on the Falcon was most satisfying. I will be seeing this film again. Many times.","true":true}
