Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a huge Star Wars fan. Not just the OG Trilogy. I have either loved or really liked all 8 films that came before this one. What happened here? This movie was awful. The plot is ridiculously bad\\, most of the characters play no real part\\, many of the actors are simply wasted\\, none of the setup from The Force Awakens was followed up on. Did the director and writer ever watch any of the other films? They must not have. I felt embarrassed for the cast and crew and I feel bad that this was the final performance from Carrie Fisher as Leia. I'm sorry Carrie\\, you deserved better. \\n\\nOn the plus side\\, there is now a character that is even more ridiculous and laughable than Jar Jar Binks. Yay\\, Rose!!","true":true}
