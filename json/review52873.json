Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A-Maz-ing!  Not sure why this has such a low audience score.  The movie is fantastic and moves the story long well.  Yes\\, there are things and moments I didn't care for or made me go hmmm?  But\\, as an overall movie it was entertaining\\, energetic and fun.  Some of the visuals are just beautiful and amazing and you can definitely tell Johnson's different style which only adds to the movie.  Is is better than Force Awakens?  Don't know\\, what I can say is\\, it is different and I also don't think it is as much like Empire as Force Awakes was like A New Hope.","true":true}
