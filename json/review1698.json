Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As an \\\"old\\\" school Star Wars fan I was completely disappointed in the handling and comedic approach to what could have and should have been great Star Wars story moments. Film was pretty disjointed\\, story line logic(even in a fantasy flick) of scenes was lacking. Hated all the silly Jedi mind encounters\\, scenes with Lea(especially the space flight scene) and Luke were just silly\/poorly done. Yoda and Luke's comical handling\/destruction of Jedi lore?! Come on...I could keep going and going about how lame was Snokes lack of back history and quick demise\\, lack of good scenes with Chewbacca and the lame character development of the the new female parts. I'll stop picking now and yes my expectations were rightfully very high and perhaps Abrams will bring back the magic in the next flick....","true":true}
