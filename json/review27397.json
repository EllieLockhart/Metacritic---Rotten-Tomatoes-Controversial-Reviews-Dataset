Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Outstanding chapter in the starwars saga! Elements that may disappoint some\\, give others a different take on what is to come. I sense a great disturbance in the force\\, some of what seems to be\\, I believe is another creative ploy to hide what will truly be revealed in the final chapter of this trilogy. OUTSTANDING movie highly reccomended.","true":true}
