Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing. I saw A New Hope in the theater in 1978. I remember the feeling of gravitas and depth of purpose in that original film. They've never come close since Empire. And this was as far from sincere as it gets. Alternating between cheap pandering and outright contempt for original fans is no way to write a story. I've seen every other sequel more than once. This is my first and last time for The Last Jedi.","true":true}
