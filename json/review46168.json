Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wait for the blue ray edition. That way you can: get the bonus footage\/commentary\\, fast forward through needless dialogue\\, hit pause for bathroom breaks\\, and play Luke's send off (the BEST part of the movie) and the action scenes as many times as you want without feeling like your time was wasted.","true":true}
