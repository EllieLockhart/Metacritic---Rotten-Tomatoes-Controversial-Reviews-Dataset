Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly\\, the plot largely moves forward via Deus Ex Machina and characters making abysmally dumb decisions. Even if you can justify withholding information from Poe\\, the Commander withheld information from other members of the bridge\\, which is absurd considering they're needed for the plan.  \\n\\nIn the first movie of the original trilogy what Jedis could do was very clearly defined\\, and in seven episodes before this one we never saw any new abilities from the first with the exception of force lightning in E2. This movie 3 new abilities arrive all when they're convenient to the plot. This is lazy story telling\/Deus Ex. \\n \\nThe light speed jump in general is nonsensical. Not only does it beg the question \\\"why hasn't the rebellion done this for decades?\\\" but it also makes you wonder \\\"why don't ships get vaporized colliding with the trillions of asteroids in space every time they make the jump to lightspeed?\\\"  \\n\\nThe positives of the movie is basically the last 15 minutes\\, the visuals in general\\, and Rei and Kylo being likable. Everything else is a poorly thought out mess. Abysmal story telling\\, that the title \\\"Star Wars\\\" can't save.","true":true}
