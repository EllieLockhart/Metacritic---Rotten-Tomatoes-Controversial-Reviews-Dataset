Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The 2 long year of anticipation after TFA shitty introduction to the SW Saga that spoiled everything that the true fans hold dear. The hole victory celebration in the ROFJ was spoiled by the mysterious First Order apperance and Supreme Leader Snoke. Whose Indentity the creatrs did take serious to explore deapper. The creators poo on the fans and their brilliant theories that were developed over the course for Snoke and Rey's Parents. And they made Luke a pisimistic loser. Such a shame. SW is for fans that is why creators must hear our voices and desire about the character. Look back to Lrgrnds - Thrawn or History of Solo twins. I don't like it. These is not the darkest SW film. Revange of the Sith is the most darkest SW film.","true":true}
