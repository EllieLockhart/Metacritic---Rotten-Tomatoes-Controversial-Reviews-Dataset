Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The current low audience rating is a little ridiculous to me. This movie has its flaws but should never be ranked amongst the horrible prequels. Kylo Ren has become one of the greatest villains in Star Wars history. All of the scenes between Rey\\, Luke and Kylo were done really well. The action was good\\, there were some pretty good twists but nothing crazy. All in all this movie is definitely an 8\/10 for me. I was entertained the whole time.\\n\\nIf I had any complaints it would be that they could have made it about 30 minutes shorter. The casino scenes weren't very good\\, I could have gone without those. Poe didn't have a great showing this movie either\\, at times he came off kind of stupid. And they never explained who the hell snope is and where the hell he came from. But still very solid film getting a little more criticism than it deserves","true":true}
