Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie gave me the same feeling I had when I saw Avatar\\, thought it was pretty cool when I first went to see it\\, but then as soon as the movie was over\\, all the plot holes\\, terrible writing and such OVERT hamhanded focus on sjw and PC themes became hard to ignore.\\n\\nThis movie basically makes all the prior movies pointless in regards the story.\\n\\nIt also wasnt just me\\, my 15 and 12 year old sons noticed the messages of the story too\\, and their interest in things Star Wars has gone down quite a bit.","true":true}
