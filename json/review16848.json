Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Intentional alienation of older parents that are Star Wars fans who are sharing with their children. All future Star Wars films boycotted. Corporate Disney is also creating brand fatigue with over sateration. Boycotting from now on. Bye bye.","true":true}
