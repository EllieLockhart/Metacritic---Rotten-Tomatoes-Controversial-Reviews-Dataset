Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am not  a huge star wars fan\\, but this movie especially was horrible. Lots of movies have the same plotline so this movie was no different. I think that if they had a plot twist the movie would have been more interesting. It's like seeing the same movie over and over again.","true":true}
