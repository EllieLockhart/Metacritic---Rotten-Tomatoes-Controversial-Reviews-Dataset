Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best Star Wars film since Empire. People who come away disappointed and the fans who made the expectations way too high with the wild fan theories and got angry when those theories were not fulfilled. Also\\, the majority of complaints about the film pertain to elements in the greater story that weren't answered because this is the middle in a trilogy. If anything this film sets up those questions even higher for the next film. Pacing was an issue but felt nicer the second time\\, and you really notice other details in the film that explain later plot points in the narrative. Overall a fantastic film that has its own ambitions in the story and the deeper meaning of the force.","true":true}
