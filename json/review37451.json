Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are no \\\"quite good\\\" moments in this film. No\\, every scene is either total crap or totally awesome. Unfortunately the cringy scenes occupy too much of the watching time to give a positive evaluation to the movie as a whole\\, however the main storyline is good and the relationships between Ray\\, Luke\\, Kylo Renn and Snoke are  developed very well. In conclusion\\, I think the movie is definitely worth watching though it does at times make your eyes and ears bleed.","true":true}
