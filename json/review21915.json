Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just saw in the theater and I'm cutting a pasting my review from The Force Awakens\\, since its almost the same movie: An incoherent muddle that is just an excuse for LucasFilms and Disney to milk the Star Wars franchise for millions\\, if not billions\\, more. Too long\\, too many pointless fight scenes and\\, other than Fin\\, just forgettable characters or the re-treads from the previous films cashing their checks. The few chuckles and nods to the past just don't make up for this turgid slog.\\n\\nThe only additions that to this film is the re-appearance of Luke Skywalker. Yet\\, even that turns in to a Stephen Sagal-like existential mess\\, because at least Segal can carry smug pretentiousness off. Wait until it comes out for pay per view if you must see.","true":true}
