Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I feel compelled to write a review for this film given the low audience score.  I loved this movie.  Go see it and form your own opinion!\\n\\nI'm the sort of person who always knows the end of the movie at the beginning\\, but this film surprised me.  I felt like a kid again watching the original trilogy -- on the edge of my seat to see what would happen next.  And the movie did not disappoint.  At several points\\, the audience burst into applause in the middle of the film!\\n\\nI am going to see this movie for the third time on Thursday\\, and I can't wait!","true":true}
