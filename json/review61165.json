The game is flawless from a visual perspective. Even the most negative reviews agree. The level of care and detail placed into the environments\\, characters\\, etc is simply bar-raising and I appreciated all of it.

Thank you to everyone who worked hard to ensure that the game looked as perfect as it could have.\r\rThe only thing I didn't completely love was the gameplay. It's pretty much the same as the first and I hated the task of rummaging around environments to salvage supplies and collectables. It takes up so much time and it's so boring walk along every empty store shelf while mashing triangle to pick up anything you happen to intersect with. There's an accessibility setting which helps make this a little bit easier\\, but it's still morbidly time-consuming. I'm certain the game would be 30% shorter if we didn't have to do something so mundane.\r\rNow\\, here's where your opinion may differ from mine: I loved the story. It's clear that they took a huge risk with it. They really could have just played it safe and followed the theme of the first title\\, but decided to take a different route which nobody expected. It's pretty clear from the reviews that fans are completely split on that decision. Personally\\, I did not expect to be sent on such a roller coaster and I enjoyed the ride from start to finish. Definitely a breath of fresh air compared to other sequels with predictable and redundant plots. With a series like this\\, you just can't please everyone. Some folks will never forgive Naughty Dog what they did to the story. But hopefully\\, they'll like to try.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
