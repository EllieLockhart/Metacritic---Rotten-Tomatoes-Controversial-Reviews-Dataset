Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Scenarios choices are very poor. Makes little sense after VII\\, not see so little of Rey and Luke. In other hands lots of screen time given to characters without interest at all (Rose\\, Finn\\, DJ (great name by the way)) . Key people put in coma to serve the scenario (Leia\\, Finn in VII) . Worst pursuit you can imagine for a Star Wars movie. How can not the First Order fleet destroy these tiny ships\\, they have hundreds of TIEs if the turbolaser fail. Not to mention the Snoke death... Stupid as hell and doesn't fit with the VII where he is supposedly super powerful.","true":true}
