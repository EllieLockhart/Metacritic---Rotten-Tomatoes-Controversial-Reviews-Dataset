Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars was Ok I like how it got right down to action but not a whole lot of light saber battles which was disappointing!! Now Pick what side you\u2019re on are you on the light side or the dark side. Now I would like to point out that The Director\\, Rian Johnson made this movie\\, well I like Director J.J Abrams did better for making Star Wars the Force Awakens. From what I know Finn used a light saber fighting in Star Wars 7. As well as Ray. I hope J.J Abrams will make Star Wars 9 and have Finn and Ray be a Jedi ","true":true}
