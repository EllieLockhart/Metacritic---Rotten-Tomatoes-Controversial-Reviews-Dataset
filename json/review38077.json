Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The storyline has gotten old and boring. Primary villain does bad stuff\\, but good white hat has to foil their plans. Assorted small villains and 2nd rate hero's do battle and shout Yeah a lot. Then throw in some new force magic and boring long distance communications across the galaxy. Plenty of cars being blown up and a handful of people slap them selves on the back for surviving and there's your next installment. Like Insaid\\, old and boring. Time for it to end.","true":true}
