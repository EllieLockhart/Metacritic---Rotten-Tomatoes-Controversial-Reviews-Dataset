All the flashbacks Ellie see\\, other's people points of view. It's all amazing. Beautiful and amazing. Graphics details are interesting too. Like the wire that collides and interacts with walls and glass. Snow footprints and many other examples.3. The way game influence on you. Plot twists\\, screamers. You understand why Ellie do all of this stuff\\, because you want to do the same thing. That is Last of Us II.4. Fight. You feel every punch\\, every shot\\, every mistake. You feel the weight of weapon\\, you feel the strength of character. Boss battles make you scream in horror. You can't really feel it if you didn't play the game.5. Guitar. Well come on. It is the best part of the game.Cons:1. Minor characters. I didn't like Dina and Jessie. The way how Dogs do characters' storytelling makes you punch the screen.2. Abby. She sucks\\, I want to kill her. I want to humiliate her and destroy the motherf***er. 3. Dina's nose.4. The ending. Just look at it.My rating: 7\/10.
