Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So refreshing yet still the Star Wars we know and love! Some people will never be happy with any of the new Star Wars. As for me\\, I look forward to a lifetime of brand new Star Wars to delve into!","true":true}
