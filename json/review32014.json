Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS (Even though this film isn't worth your time)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis film is sad\\, not because of the story's content pulling my heartstrings but because there are so many inconsistencies. Rian Johnson literally chucked JJ Abrams script\\, something that was consistent with the franchise's canon\\, and decided to write his own.

The Force Awakens wasn't that bad\\, this one has single-handedly ruined the franchise due to Johnson's inability to write a clear\\, concise and consistent story.
