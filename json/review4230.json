Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By far the worst of all Star Wars films I have seen. Growing up with Star Wars and having it be a big part of my life for most of my life I was completely shocked and disappointed to see how stupid humor has made it's way into A Galaxy Far Far away\\, beyond the slap stick it was near impossible for me to look past the dismissive turn the film took to everything we as fans hold dear. I do hope that J.J Abrams can fix this mess. Obi Wan must be turning in his grave seeing this!","true":true}
