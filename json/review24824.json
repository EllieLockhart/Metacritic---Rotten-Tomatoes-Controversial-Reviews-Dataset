Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My biggest problem with 'The Last Jedi' is that Rian Johnson fundamentally doesn't understand what Star Wars is about and he seems more interested in subverting expectations and weaving a convoluted thread about \\\"grey morality\\\" than he is in making an engaging Star Wars movie.\\n\\nAs a lot of people have pointed out\\, the humor is copy-and-pasted Marvel schlock\\, the pacing is jarring\\, the writing sucks\\, and ultimately very little in this movie matters.\\n\\nThe relationships feel like ABC Family dynamics and even he mystical Force has been reduced to a means of social media.\\n\\nI get why people have this idea that only bitter Star Wars fans disliked this movie\\, but The Last Jedi is a bad film. I respect Rian Johnson for at least trying something new\\, but how did Lucasfilm see what he was doing and not step in?\\n\\nThis is easily the most divisive Star Wars movie yet\\, and frankly my least favorite.","true":true}
