The story falls short in many ways. latest graphics and handling etc  are not enough to give this any more than a 5.\rI loved last of us 1 and replayed it to death like many other games such as The Witcher 3\\, and Zero Horizon Dawn to name a few. They ticked all the boxes in terms of delivering a fantastic experience and product. It saddens me to see what has come of Part 2 and thats a problem of it self. If this was a stand alone game it could of atleast been a 'meh' to an 'alright' game but because it had such 'big shoes' and expectations to fill it simply failed.\rAs i'm writing this im listing up the game for sale. Something i havent done in 15 years and that it self says alot coming from someone who keeps onto games on the off chance of replaying the game\\, but i know for certainty I wont be playing this one ever again.\rAs a gamer I seek entertainment and escapism to relax and unwind and pretty much boost my 'happiness meter' but this game left such a bad taste in my mouth and feeling miserable. Especially when you take into consideration that I paid for this and paid full price. Its sorrowful to think of all of the employees time\\, effort and sweat that went into this (especially remembering that 70% of staff left due to being crunched) for it to be...like this.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
