Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think the negative reviews from this movie stem from people wanting to see specific things and not getting them. If you go into it with an agenda you\u2019ll be disappointed\\, but if you\u2019re just a Star Wars fan wanting to see where it all goes\\, you\u2019ll have your breath taken away more than once. It\u2019s not formulaic\\, or expected\\, and while it is no where near perfect\\, the good parts of this movie (most of it)\\, are some of the best\\, most rewarding parts of the whole saga. Don\u2019t get too caught up on what you think will happen\\, because you\u2019re wrong. Just enjoy the ride ","true":true}
