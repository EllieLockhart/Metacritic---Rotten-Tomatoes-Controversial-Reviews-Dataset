Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The key word is last. While I grew up loving Star Wars\\, I still loved this movie which ended a variety of themes from the classic trilogy by casting some characters back to their beginnings. If you are looking for a remake of Empire\\, this is not your movie. If you are willing to see something new but familiar\\, you will like it.","true":true}
