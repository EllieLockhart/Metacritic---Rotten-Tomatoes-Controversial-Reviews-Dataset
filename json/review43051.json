Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was very well done. Don't listen to the negative comments. Those are from people who wanted the story to go in a different direction than it did. They had high expectations in their minds at what SHOULD happen instead of what did. The Movie is ultimately about letting go of the past to create a new future\\, which in truth\\, is perfectly done. Don't pass this movie up. It's well worth going. And remember\\, everybody hated Empire when it came out. It wasn't until many years later\\, after Return\\, that everybody realized what a masterpiece it was. The same will happen here.","true":true}
