{"101487":146676,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was in the theater for opening night\/ weekend of every single episode of Star Wars so far abd this will be my last.  Since 77\\, I remember being in awe when the star destroyer first came on screen in they opening of A New Hope.  I thought The Phantom menace would be the lowest point Star Wars would ever see.  Then\\,   hot damn! We heard the original cast was conning back\\,  we would finally see how much of a bad ass Jedi Luke became.  Since i was angry they threw out the EU content\\,  I didn't know what to expect. I began to have feelings of dread after Episode 7 when Luke got 10 seconds on screen. \\n\\nWell all my the fears i had came damn true for this movie.  What a major cock up. Rian Johnson is such a no talent hack\\, he couldn't even follow the plot lines for the last movie. It got so bad\\,  they even punked the token black heroe\\,  Finn. When I tell you they screwed him over\\, it's an understatement.  The guy that helped lead the resistance to Starkiller base\\,  needed to be saved and controlled by the Asian girl.  Amd that really is the theme for the movie\\,  guys should die\\,  girls run everything.  I suspect Kathleen Kennedy had a role to play in this abortion of a movie . The saddest pay wad killing of Luke after portraying him as a straight up ass and even worse\\,  a coward. \\n\\nThis movie was a mess and a catastrophy to the Star War's saga. The heroes are spent\\,  too old to have another try and make it right. Carrie Fischer is dead\\, Ford wants nothing to do with it and Mark Hamill was treated like a bitch for speaking up and raising concern with Lukes scripted parts.  Don't be surprised when his contract is all done\\,  he really talks.  So in closing\\,  Kathleen  Kennedy\\,  go back to serving George Lucas coffee\\, you suck. Rian Johnson\\,  bwahahaha\\, sad\\, you had Star Wars and you choked.","true":true}
