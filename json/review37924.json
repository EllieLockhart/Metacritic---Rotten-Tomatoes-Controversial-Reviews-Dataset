Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The second installment of a trilogy has a hard job to do\\, and this film does it beautifully. It adds depth to what came before in The Force Awakens\\, building on the groundwork laid in that film\\, and raises the stakes for the conclusion coming in 2019.","true":true}
