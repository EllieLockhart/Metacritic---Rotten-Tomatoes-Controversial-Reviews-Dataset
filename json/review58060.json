Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Without reiterating what the rest of the reviewers have already said\\, this movie was just disappointing. I have always been a lifelong fan of the Star Wars franchise and saw it the first time with just that mindset. After my first go\\, I decided maybe seeing it as a Star Wars fan was a bad idea\\, and instead\\, I should appreciate it as a movie. So I went into it a second time to appreciate the director\u2019s ambition and the direction he thought the franchise should go. Behind a great cast and phenomenal special effects\\, there lies a weak script and underdeveloped storyline. Everything we were introduced to in Episode VII was stripped away and we were given the most linear non-compelling Star Wars story since the plot line of Jar Jar Binks. Instead of describing why I am giving a star for special effects\\, and a star for originality\\, I instead will describe the missing stars. As mentioned before\\, one will go to the plot that was bashed to death with a rusty shovel\\, replaced by a politically correct agenda and poor miscommunication of story direction. Another star is taken away because of the linear story and meaningless dialogue and scenes. Concepts are meant to be introduced and developed\\, no matter how small. Even looking at Pulp Fiction\\, my favorite scene was when Christopher Walken explains the meaning of young Bruce Willis\u2019 father\u2019s pocket watch. The watch played no role larger than giving us a window into Bruce Willis\u2019 life. In The Last Jedi\\, we get to see how Rose was impacted by slavery on the casino planet\\, only to have it be irrelevant after they escape. The last star is taken away for ruining the expectations of the fans. It\u2019s alright when new movies are released with no ties to a franchise and they underperform\\, but when a cultural phenom like Star Wars is released\\, Disney better put the fan first\\, because that\u2019s the best way to captivate a crowd and create a timeless masterpiece that the original trilogy succeeded in doing.","true":true}
