Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The story felt more like a disposable TV episode. The Last Jedi betrays the original trilogy\\, by cheating fans out of what could have been an amazing ride with Luke\\, who in my opinion 'IS' Star Wars.  I was left with a sour taste in my mouth\\, everything original fans knew and loved about the universe\\, has been mercilessly snuffed out\\, instead of cherished. This isn't Star Wars. Very disappointed.","true":true}
