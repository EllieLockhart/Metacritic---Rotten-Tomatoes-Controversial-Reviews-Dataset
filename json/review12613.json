Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't remember a Star Wars movie that had so many kamikazes in it. The writer just seemed to run out of ideas for how the rebels could escape and just decided to hurl characters into enemy ships. \\n\\nBenicio Del Torros character is pointless. As is Finn and Roses journey. We learn nothing accept that horse racing is bad and Benicio can stutter pretty well.\\n\\nAll the women in this film excluding Rae are vapid demeaning stereotypes and have no character arc to help explain their change in behavior. I can only imagine their only purpose was to shock sexist men who never thought Star Wars could have strong female leads..... as if the previous saga with Leai and Padme hadn't proved that already. \\n\\nThis film would have had a saving grace if Harrison Ford had stayed alive just to remind people \\\"that's not how the force works!\\\"","true":true}
