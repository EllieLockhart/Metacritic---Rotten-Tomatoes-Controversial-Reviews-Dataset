Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Let the past die. Kill it\\, if you have to\\\" if that's the concept they wanted\\, they should have done a reboot or a remake\\, because that's what remakes and reboots usually are for. \\nIt was a horrible sequel. Is just a reboot dressed as sequel\\, and as most of the reboots\\, is not so good. \\nI felt it was a disrespect with Mark Hamill be hired\\, to later use his character in that way. \\nI'm pretty sure Mark\\, based on all the interviews I have seen (as most of the fans)\\, never thought his character was going to be used in that way\\, it was just common sense. So for me\\, the movie failed totally\\, and not only for that\\,  Rey is an incredible powerful Jedi without any training \\, she had zero training in the last 2 films\\, is totally and complete absurd.  \\nIt's just like she belongs more to the X-men saga and not into a Star Wars film. \\nThe film could be unpredictable\\, following much better the Star Wars universe\\, instead people is claiming that being unpredictable is good enough to be considered a great SW film\\, even if those things didn't have any logic. \\nThere are plenty of other things about why I didn't like these sequels\\, but those two\\, are good enough to dislike both films. (TFA and TLJ). Double thumbs down.  And yes\\, for me\\,  the prequels are much much better films than TLJ\\, even if TLJ looks gorgeous.?","true":true}
