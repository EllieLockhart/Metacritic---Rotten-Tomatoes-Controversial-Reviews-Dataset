Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Didn't like that Snoke was killed too quickly without having to fight Luke. Also Luke never really showed how much of a master he really is. He was portrayed as a weakling compared to Rae. This movie overall gave it a B-  and am a total Star Wars fan. Was disappointed.","true":true}
