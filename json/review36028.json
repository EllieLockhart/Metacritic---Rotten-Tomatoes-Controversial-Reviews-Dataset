Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi simply put\\, is an absolutely thrilling\\, two and a half hour long ride. If you analyze too many details within the film\\, or go into it thinking that you\u0092re going to see the story you\u0092ve wanted to be told for the last two years\\, you\u0092ll be disapointed. But Rian Johnson brought an unconvential story to life in the most exciting and natural way\\, that only a skilled director could. Don\u0092t think too much about the film and how it fits in the Star Wars series\\, and just appreciate the magic.","true":true}
