Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It looks like they took episodes of Clone Wars 2008 and just put it together with the new characters. \\n\\nIt's a good film nonetheless but there is a lot of questionable paths Rian Johnson has taken this Star Wars sequel to. \\n\\nStar Wars The Last Jedi has great sound effects and visuals. It just needs more lightsaber action.","true":true}
