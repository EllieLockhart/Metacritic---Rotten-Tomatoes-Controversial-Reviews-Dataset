Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Over a year after watching this i still remember watching it and how disapointed i was with it.\\nnot only is it really hard to watch\\, but it also is full of stuff that isnt interesting. the over all story is dull\\, theres no peril and nothing keeping you interested in what is happening on screen.\\nmy expectations were subverted\\, i expected to like this film. i totally hated it.\\npeople in the same showing walked out. within the first 5 mins you go from excitement\\, to total disapointment\\, and then the mother joke comes and cuts you straight out of the film. from there on you are no longer involved with the story unfolding in front of you. the light sabre ofver the shoulder made me roll my eyes so hard.\\nits a shame\\, as its broken 40 years of loving Star wars. i no longer care what happens next\\, i havent bought and of the toys\\, books or memorabilia. \\ni suppose its done its job\\, its shaken off the people that have supported it\\, so it can now go and do what ever it likes\\, which is fine. i just wont be following it anymore.","true":true}
