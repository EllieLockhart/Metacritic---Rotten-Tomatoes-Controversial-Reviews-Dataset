Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ryan Johnson knocked it out of the park. He's modernized and brought Star Wars into the modern movie era in a spectacular way. Anyone giving this movie a bad rating is just a stick in the mud\\, and shouldn't be listened too. The critics at least recognize the movie as being as good at it is.","true":true}
