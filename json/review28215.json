Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poorly written\\, badly acted\\, poor direction\\, overuse of CGI\\, and a betrayal of the star wars universe. There are plenty of reviews on this site and all over the internet that can explain what is wrong in more detail so I won't go to far into why I feel such hatred towards this movie\\, but after seeing so many people rave about it and critics giving it high scores\\, I had to give my two cents. I also have so many grievances that if I were to air them all here it would be longer than the script for this movie\\, which was too long\\, btw.","true":true}
