Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointed! One of the worst Star Wars movies! Anyone who says it was a good Star Wars movie does not know Star Wars at all! Disney bought the critics! Horrible plot holes! Horrible character development! Horrible jokes throughout the movie made it feel so Disney! They ruined Luke\u2019s storyline! They answered big questions with a fu#\u20ac you fans\\, your questions don\u2019t matter! Don\u2019t go see this movie! Save your money and show Disney they messed up and maybe they with fix Star Wars in the next movie. ","true":true}
