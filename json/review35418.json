Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi certainly did not disappoint! I liked it when I saw it the first time\\, but it really took a second viewing for me to fully appreciate it. The whole theme of letting the past go was very fitting\\, because this isn't the Skywalker saga anymore\\, and it's not supposed to be. That's the whole point -- while The Force Awakens paralleled A New Hope\\, The Last Jedi really sets this trilogy apart as it's own story\\, and that's something that was really needed for the story to become what it needed to be. It wasn't afraid to take risks\\, and they really paid off\\, some in ways that I didn't fully grasp until the second viewing. Overall\\, this was a great film\\, and I can't wait to see what's in store for the last installment of the trilogy.","true":true}
