Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"First things first this is the best looking console game that I have ever played. The level design is at its best. The score is just as good as the first game. The combat is about the same as the first one and so is the scavenging. But what gives it such a low rating for me is that the story is just sloppy. Within the first hour of the game\\, Joel the character that you played in the first one and played countless hours of dies in such a cheap way to just give the game it\u2019s existence. Revenge\\, that is the story\\, not saying that\u2019s bad but revenge is literally the most original story you can do. Half of this game is played by Ellie whom who grow to dislike as the game progresses because of just how poorly she is written. She isn\u2019t that jolly funny girl in the first game anymore she is just a boring non-charismatic person. Now I know that a lot can happen in the four years that have passed and they do show flashbacks as to why she is boring and etc. But they do it in a way that just doesn\u2019t seem believable. The other half of the game is played by Joel\u2019s killer Abby who honestly had better missions and character development than Ellie. The game just randomly switches to Abby and I thought that oh I wouldn\u2019t be playing her long so for two hours I just was trying to get her done as fast as possible but it turns out that wasn\u2019t the case. I didn\u2019t like playing Abby at all. It was just such a drag that I just wanted to get it over with. At the end of Abby\u2019s chapter three you have to fight Ellie who is the main protagonist of the game and who you loved and cared so much about in the first game. That to me was just so upsetting to people who loved the first game and grew to love Ellie. The end of the game is also just so unfulfilling I\u2019m so many ways. Ellie goes all this way through all this trouble loses some friends and a father figure to only not kill Abby and just let her live. Now I now what they were going for revenge gets you nowhere\\, it\u2019s not good for anybody but if you went through all the trouble and had so many of your close ones die you\u2019d best be getting your revenge. The game kills off people in the game who you generally know and they do it so much and often that when someone dies it\u2019s like (oh ok hm what else is new). The shock wasn\u2019t there anymore it\u2019s was just not surprising. This is the first game that I switched the difficulty to the easiest difficulty just to get it done and over with. It was just so frustrating playing this game waiting seven years from playing one of the greatest video games of all time to just being an utter disappointment. I enjoyed playing the game because I like the world of the last of us I like the different factions and the whole zombie apocalypse. I just would not buy this game at full price. If anything I\u2019d say watch someone play it so you don\u2019t have to waste any money. If I had to choose one word for this game it would disappointing.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
