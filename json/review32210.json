Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars as Star Wars has never been. The Last Jedi feels like no other Star Wars\\, but at the same time is unmistakably Star Wars. Rian Johnson has produced a film which evidently has divided the Star Wars fan base.\\nFor me\\, The Last Jedi was brilliant. I walked into the cinema excited to see what was on offer\\, and I did not leave disappointed. The new direction of returning characters made the plot feel fresh and the new characters begin to feel fleshed out.\\nThe recent internet backlash has lead to fans demanding The Last Jedi being removed from the Canon. This is a ridiculous overreaction to a film which admittedly would not\\, and has not pleased every one.\\nThe only thing that I did not like was the overuse of silly comedic jokes. At first it was chuckle worthy but by then end it became distracting.\\n\\nA brilliant film\\, but not perfect. At least it isn't Episode II.","true":true}
