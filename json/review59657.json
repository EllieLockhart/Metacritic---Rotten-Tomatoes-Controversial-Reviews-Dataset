We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"My two biggest issues with the game are actually not what most people are posting.\r\rFirstly\\, the story is too stretched out and insanely boring at sometimes. Turning into a walking simulator for hours upon end.\rAnd secondly\\, you are forced to play as one of the most hated characters I think I've ever seen in any game ever released.\r\rThe ending\\, in my personal opinion\\, wasn't really that bad. By the time you reach the fight with Abby\\, the game has drained you as a player so much\\, and the characters have gone through so much\\, that NOT killing Abby feels more conclusive than actually killing her.\rAnd at the very end\\, when you can't play the guitar and you walk away\\, it feels like a sad ending done pretty well.\r\rBut throughout the entirety of the middle of the game\\, the general gameplay and story is just so boring\\, stretched out\\, filled with loopholes and absolutely stupid character decisions that I had a hard time finishing the game. I often stopped for breaks just to chat to family or friends because the game was so morally and emotionally and mentally draining.\r\rOverall\\, there really isn't much to love or talk about in this game. It's just a sad story that pushed the sadness to the forefront and left no room for good writing.\r\rInsanely good graphics though. Gameplay was somewhat flat but pretty decent. Accessibility options were a huge plus. There are so many options to help out any type of gamer.\r\r4\/10 for me.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
