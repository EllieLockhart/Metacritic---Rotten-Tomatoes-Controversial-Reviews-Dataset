Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute waste of time and money. Could have been 30 minutes shorter if they had removed all the phony and long drawn out moments of personal introspection. Even the light sabre fight scenes where amateurish in their choreography\\, they looked like something from the 1980's. Wasted $17 each for 3 iMax tickets\\, not sure what the fanboys see in this drivel.","true":true}
