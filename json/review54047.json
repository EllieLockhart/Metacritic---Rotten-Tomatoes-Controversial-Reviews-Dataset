{"101487":130260,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I couldn't stop laughing while reading the bad reviews. The funny part is they all make perfect sense. I loved the first Star Wars trilogy\\, and unfortunately The Last Jedi is deviating from from its roots. The Resistance is now dumb AF. Leia\\, or may I call her \\\"Neo\\\" (The Matrix)\\, has over-natural powers now. Even Luke has his \\\"Matrix\\\" moment. Fin and Rose\\, the casino\\, really?? This movie was definitely an entertaining mess. At times\\, I thought I was watching Space Balls Episode 2. JJ\\, please do something to fix this mess on Episode 9.","true":true}
