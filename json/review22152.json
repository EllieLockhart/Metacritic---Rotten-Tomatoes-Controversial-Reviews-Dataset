Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Kind of hard to write about it without giving spoilers. All I'll say is the visual was great but the story was a let down. Unneeded deaths of characters that I know for a fact should have been treated differently. It's hard to say it's a straight to DVD movie because of its history but If I'd have to do it over again I'd just wait to rent it for .99\u00a2. That's all it's worth. ","true":true}
