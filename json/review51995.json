Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After all the hype and speculation Star Wars The Last Jedi was a huge disappointment. There was too much going on. Unrealistic plot points. The main plot was good\\, but not enough to save the tacked on subplots that weigh the film down. This had potential to be great\\, but I fear most Star Wars fans will feel whole experience is not a good film.  As a second act the stake should get more ramped and this is not the case. I believe once the three film is out you can simply skip this film. \\n\\nNow I would like to say this is the consensus of my community. All Star Wars fans. It's not hype or bots. The film really is that bad. \\n\\nRian Johnson should NOT get his own trilogy. He is a bad film maker.","true":true}
