Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson shouldn't even be allowed to direct a car wash fundraiser after this. He should have never been given the keys to this Porsche. His biggest movie up to this one was Looper\\, which was underwhelming and nowhere close to the scale of Star Wars.","true":true}
