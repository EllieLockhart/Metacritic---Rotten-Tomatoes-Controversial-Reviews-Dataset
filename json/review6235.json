Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney has ruined the Starwars Universe they have also ruined the Legacy of Luke SkyWalker Who will always be the Face of the Franchise.  Disney needs to figure their shit out and Quit ruining one of the Greastest Movies Series filmed and Quit Ruining Luke SkyWalkers Legacy which was cemented before Disney decided to wipe out all of his heroics from books written about him.","true":true}
