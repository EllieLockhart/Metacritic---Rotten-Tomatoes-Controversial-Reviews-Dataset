We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"As time goes on we can start to see the reviews from the people who ACTUALLY played the game and didn't jump to the fanboy\/hate bandwagon.I would rate it a solid 9.5 but since it is not possible i'll settle for a 9.The gameplay is improved in every way imaginable from the first game\\, it feels heavy and meaningful\\, you actually feel bad killing most of the time.The graphics are (in my opinion) the best we have seen from the ps4.Here comes the \\\"controversial\\\" part\\, the story. It is a sotry about revenge\\, about a cycle of seemingly never ending violence.Joel's death lights the fuze for this story of revenge\\, making you HATE Abby and wanting to kill her at all costs. But as time goes on and you get to play as Abby (i'd say probably 1\/3rd of the game?) you get to see that like Ellie and Joel\\, she too has a family and some friends to protect\\, an active comunity.At the end of the first game i kept trying to excuse Joel from the countless murders and the dooming of hope for finding a cure. \\\"He killed a lot of people... but he did it for Ellie\\\" i thought.This time is the other way around\\, i was starting to undertand Abby and why she did what she did while at the same time trying to hate her. \\\"She saved some kids from certain death BUT she killed Joel\\\".No other game has ever given me an experience sush as this one.Despite all of this i too would have liked to see Abby die (which is why i rated it 9.5 and not 10)\\, but i understand why Ellie ended up not doing it. She finally breaks the circle or death\\, hate and revenge and becomes \\\"the better woman\\\"\\, in a sense\\, better than Joel was.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
