Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lifelong fan I was shocked at Johnson\u2019s poor handling of the material and the direction he took with the Characters\\, especially Luke. For the first time ever I have seen a Star Wars movie that I can honestly say I didn\u2019t like. The movie lacked familiarity to the Star Wars Universe we all know and love. Luke calls a lightsaber a laser sword\\, seriously??? Let\u2019s just hope the next movie is able to recover from this disaster.","true":true}
