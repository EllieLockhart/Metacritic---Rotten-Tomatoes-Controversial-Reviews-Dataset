Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some great characters from TFA got the prequel treatment.  JJ Abrams has a big mess to clean up in Episode 9.","true":true}
