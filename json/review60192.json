Naughty Dog knows these characters better than any of us\\, and they are telling the story they want to. Just because we don't agree with something\\, it doesn't make the game bad. We're meant to disagree with choices they make\\, because believe it or not\\, these characters are flawed humans\\, just like the rest of us (yeah\\, I'm looking at you guys giving this game a 0 without even picking it up). I definitely didn't always agree with the direction the story took\\, or the decisions the characters made\\, but that's the beauty of it.. I'm not supposed to. It's not my story. It's Naughty Dogs\\, and man is it brutal\\, dark\\, and miserable. But again\\, that's the point. I'm just thankful they're not afraid to tell it the way they wanted it. As for the gameplay\\, I don't have much to say. Yeah it's more or less the same\\, but refined with an added layer. It worked the first time\\, and it's even better here. As for the environments\\, Naughty Dog has outdone themselves. The attention to detail is crazy. To think a designer spent weeks perfecting a room that I rushed through in 4 seconds blows my mind. The game does a good job making the environments open enough giving you multiple paths to an objective without the need for objective marker or a mini-map. I never felt lost\\, but at the same time I never knew exactly how I was supposed to get somewhere. Naughty Dog really found the perfect balance of making the game feel open without making it an open world game.\r\rI finished the game resonating with characters I originally hated\\, and hating characters I thought I loved\\, overall feeling like ****. It's a miserable story with the mechanics\\, environments\\, and acting to back it up. The game is a masterpiece. If you loved the first game and want to see how Naughty Dogs develops and punishes these characters for the choices they've made\\, play this now\\, before someone spoils it for you.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
