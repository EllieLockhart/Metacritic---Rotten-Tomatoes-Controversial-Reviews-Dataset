Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never posted a review before\\, but as a die-hard Star Wars fan I had let this fly. I thought this was a pretty bad Star Wars movie. The biggest problem I had was what they did with Luke Skywalker's character arc. This guy IS Star Wars and I couldn't be more disappointed with what they did to him\\, and that it is cannon now. We also got no pay off for Snoke or Rey's parents\\, which were played-up in Force Awakens. Finally\\, I found myself not caring about the side characters that took up 70% of the screen time at all. Considering all of this\\, plus a ridiculous Leia scene\\, I left the theater very disappointed\\, and worried about the future of Star Wars.","true":true}
