Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The quote that sums up the whole movie for me is this: \\n\\n\\\"Let the past die. Kill it\\, if you have to.\\\"\\n\\nThey certainly killed Star Wars and the Star Wars fan in me. They totally took a steaming dump all over Luke and episodes 4\/5\/6\/7.\\n\\nI couldn't believe all the terrible plot choices. The worst part was purple-haired Holdo. If she had just told Poe what was up\\, we wouldn't have had to sit through the cringe-inducing casino scene with boring Finn and Rose. Maybe they could have given us\\, I don't know\\, an actual lightsaber to lightsaber fight scene using that wasted time. How do you make a Star Wars movie with two lightsabers never touching? Oh that's right. Luke calls them laser swords now. Puke. Thanks for ruining Star Wars\\, Disney.","true":true}
