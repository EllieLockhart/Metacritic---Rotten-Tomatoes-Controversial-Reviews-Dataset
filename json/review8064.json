{"101487":120125,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic and INTERESTING Star Wars movie\\, far better than TFA. Could even be the best Star Wars movie ever made. It's nothing like the prequels\\, which were nonsensical and added nothing of value to the franchise. Sure\\, they may have TECHNICALLY added story\\, but its not much of a story when its so uninteresting\\, badly written\\, and predictable. The Last Jedi was nothing like that. It has an immensely engaging plotline\\, it doesn't rely heavily on nostalgia\\, and is far different from Empire (despite a few callbacks). There were many twists in this movie\\, and I didn't see any of them coming.\\n\\nRey and Kylo Ren especially were brilliant in this movie\\, and The Finn-Rose subplot wasn't \\\"pointless\\\" as some shallow are people saying. Things in this movie weren't \\\"pointless\\\"\\, they were to show that you can't succeed every time. This was a movie about failure. Everyone in this movie has a FAILURE\\, and every character grows.\\n\\n \\\"The best teacher failure makes\\\"\\n\\nThe way they handled Snoke was one of the best scenes in Star Wars\\, hands down.\\n\\nMy only worry is that JJ Abrams will not be able to successfully pick up where Rian Johnson left off. Hopefully he can.\\n\\nI like long movies\\, and for me\\, I only had that \\\"dragging on\\\" feeling for a few SECONDS in like one or two scenes at most. If you really hate long movies\\, you may have a problem with TLJ\\, but it wasn't an issue for me. Long movies\\, in my opinion\\, help with pacing\\, since everything doesn't have to be crammed into a tiny little box. One movie with this problem is Ant-Man\\, but there are countless others. There were no tonal problems in my opinion. There WERE serious moments followed by jokes\\, but the most serious moments didn't have jokes\\, only the more minorly serious ones.  Some people criticise how powerful The Force was in this movie\\, but it's The Force! It only ever does Force-like things\\, never anything overpowered or ridiculous. TLJ brings back the magic of The Force that the prequels tried to kill.\\n\\nThe ONLY scene I didn't like was when Leia saved herself from that rather deadly situation. However\\, it wasn't immersion-breakingly bad. If you can wield The Force\\, this is possible\\, since the vaccuum of space does NOT\\, in fact\\, kill instantly.\\n\\nStrongly recommend\\, unless you're a curmudgeon who can't handle even minor change. The new cast is all likeable\\, and the people who are whining about a feminist or \\\"SJW\\\" agenda are ridiculous. Most importantly\\, The Last Jedi is an interesting and engaging movie where each character has to face failure and learn from their mistakes.","true":true}
