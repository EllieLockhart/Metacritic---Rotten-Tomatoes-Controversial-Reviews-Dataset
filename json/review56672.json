Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was disappointing in its respect for what came before it and seems to be about marketing.  I admit I had things that I would of like to have seen happen that didn't\\, but I am going to stand by my rating.\\nMickey had to hammer it home at the end with that decoder ring commercial at the end.  I get that Mickey wants girls to \\\"buy in\\\" to Star Wars but can we dial it back down to 10 please? For all the \\\"diversity\\\" claims\\, the human force users are still only one color in this trilogy. This film was less unpredictable and closer to wtf. \\nI feel like on some level this film is like a very soft reboot of Star Wars. \\nIt's a shame the way they are treating the heroes of the past and the accomplishments during the original trilogy. \\nThe main characters are a problem from Mary Sue to Shoehorn Rose\\, they just keep checking Disney boxes to sell the movie. \\nIt would be great if Star Wars just kept the fun and not push some agenda. For a real step though\\,  Rey could have been another color\\, sexual orientation\\, and have a less desirable build.  \\nI hope people who enjoy the film\\, keep enjoying it. No one wins if Star Wars fails as a whole\\, I just don't want them to forget the people who \\\"came before\\\".","true":true}
