Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I grew-up with the original franchise...episodes 4\\,5\\,6 were incredible. Episode 1 was refreshing when it was released\\, then Hayden Christensen ruined episodes 2 and 3. Anyway\\, TFA was a good reboot\\, but the same story. I like the new characters\\, but wasn\u2019t fired-up to go out and see the movie a second time. TLJ changes all of that. I really do want to see this movie again. Expect character and plot building with constant twists and turns. New character Rose follows the pattern that anyone can become a hero...sorry\\, Rose-haters! New animals and force abilities...love it! Humor injection was good and not overpowering. The subplot failures are frustrating\\, but you can\u2019t win them all. The casino scenes were great eye candy. Awesome ending. The rebel forces are minimized to almost nothing\\, but there is still hope. Yes\\, this is what Star Wars is about. If you are a SW fan\\, this movie will make you think and compare to the rest of the SW franchise. TLJ has interesting characters\\, humor\\, battles\\, and adds to the overall story. This is the stuff that makes SW successful. If you want to tear the movie apart and compare to the old movies\\, question the technology and \u201csuper Leia\u201d\\, etc. then prepare to not be entertained.","true":true}
