Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Man this is a tough one for me since I have been down since the original love the OG movies and even liked the Prequels but thought they could have been better but these 2 movies kinda leave me wanting more....I mean the force awakens was a good movie at least to kick off the new school versions but this movie the last Jedi has to be the weakest of all the franchise....it just seemed like something was missing I mean some of the scenes were good but the movie was Blah....I think they need to listen to someone else that has some roots in the film cause it doesn't have the same star wars magic that it did at least when the force awakens came out. I truly hope they rebound and bring it back to at least a respectable level cause this movie was ok but for star wars it was a disppointment ","true":true}
