Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is what I would call the \\\"Game of Thrones\\\" of the Skywalker Saga. Coming out of the theater felt like seeing the Red Wedding for the first time - it's not what you wanted to happen but it happened anyway\\, and now the story's all the better for it. It may not have gone the way I would've wanted it to go\\, but that's what makes the movie great.\\n\\nWhile I'll have to admit\\, it's not a perfect film\\, and while it may have its low points and left us with even more questions than answers\\, it's definitely a thought provoking one. 24 hours since seeing the movie\\, I'm still shaken and still processing what I just saw.\\n\\nAnd strangely enough\\, it's that very feeling of not being able to fully accept what had just happened that proves it worked. Now Episode XI feels like anything but predictable. At this point\\, it could go anywhere.\\n\\nTruly\\, it's not going to go the way we think.","true":true}
