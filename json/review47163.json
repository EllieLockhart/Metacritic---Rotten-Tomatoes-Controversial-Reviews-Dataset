Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a mess of a movie. There are so many things wrong with this movie.  Visuals are awesome and there's some great action scenes that work\\, but the story is nonsensical a lot of the time and it's way too long.","true":true}
