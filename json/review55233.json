Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just like many other people before me\\, I have made an account on this site just to review this awful film. I am not a bot\\, I am a real person who is not a member of the heard of sheep including critics and faux star wars fans that endlessly plug this movie. This film gets nothing but praise from media outlets everywhere. From critics\\, and public personalities everywhere\\, except from the one place it should matter most... real people. \\n\\nI feel I could write a entire book on why this movie was a complete failure of a Star Wars film. There are so many other reviews here you can refer to for all those many details. My thesis on why Rian Johnson has so spectacularly ruined this film\\, is that he simply has different priorities making this film than the original movies had. Plot point making sense\\, and feeling right is secondary to contrived dramatic moments\\, and injected cumbersome political statements. Its truly sad\\, and I genuinely hope everyone who agrees\\, also writes reviews on sites like this to stop future travesties like this film from being made in the name of Star Wars (I will not be patronizing Episode IX in theaters).","true":true}
