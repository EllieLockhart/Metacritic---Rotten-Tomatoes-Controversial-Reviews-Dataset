Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was pretty mediocre. The rebel cruiser being chased with the first order not able to catch them was pretty lame. Especially at the end where the cruiser hyperspace into the ships at the end. You don't need to be a great strategist to see the first order could have jumped right on top of the rebel ships and end it. Was a fan of Snoke's death and the Jedi battle with his guards either.","true":true}
