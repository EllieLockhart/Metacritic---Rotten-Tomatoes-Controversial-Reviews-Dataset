Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a Star Wars movie!  Did every single part of the movie makes sense and tie into my own vision for the movie? No.  Was like completely riveted to the screen for 2 1\/2 hours and plan to go see it again? Absolutely. Was it better than Jar Jar Binks? Not even a question.\\n\\nI just don't get why so many fans are so down on this movie. Maybe they are just cooler than me. \\n\\nDon't hesitate. Go see it. We both know you're going to anyways. :-)","true":true}
