Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you want nostalgia\\, this film is not for you.\\nRian Johnson tears down everything we know about Star Wars and creates his very own interpretation for a new generation of fans.\\nYes\\, there are portions of this film that could be considered blasphemous to traditional Star Wars fanatics (which kept me from giving it 5 stars)\\, but this film was refreshing.\\nIt did not take the turns we expected because it wanted us to be uncomfortable. It wanted us to evolve with the galaxy being presented to us.","true":true}
