Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am an African American\\, not a star wars fan at all\\, and I went to see this with my family\\, and we all thought the movie was absolutely horrid. First of all\\, it portrayed white males as villainous and evil\\, which as an African male who saw Hollywood do the same with African Males throughout the 80's and 90's was thoroughly disgusted.\\n\\nSecond of all the movie didn't make any sense\\, the jokes were lame\\, and most of the time the people around me\\, and my family too\\, were checking phones\\, including myself\\, constantly disengaged from this sloppy spectacle.\\n\\nI gave it half a star for the good CGI effects\\, but Disney is churning out garbage these days.","true":true}
