Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Aside from the visuals\\, this film is a travesty. It completly misshandles all of the major characters with the exception of Kylo Ren. I've been waiting 25-odd years to see Luke again\\, and this is what I get? A comedy side character that does pretty much nothing? I've loved Star Wars since I was a kid and this film ruined that legacy somehow worse than the prequels did. Luke stood for hope and you've crushed that out just so you can profit from introducing new characters. Utterly disrespectful to the fans of the original trilogy.","true":true}
