Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"as others have stated\\, the movie is poorly done. I won't give any spoilers for the sake of others. This is the first time that I got up from a Star Wars movie usually disappointed. This trilogy now seems completely pointless. The story is so incoherent and the legacy of characters from my childhood\\, completely destroyed. I have no hope for episode 9 saving this horrible\\, horrible series. I would gladly take the prequels\\, even though they were mediocre at best\\, over this disappointing cash grab. ","true":true}
