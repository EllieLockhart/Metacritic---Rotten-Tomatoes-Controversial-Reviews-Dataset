Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars the last Jedi  is what the prequel films should have been. While feeling firmly grounded in the Star Wars universe it takes bold steps forward taking the series to new heights. Purists beware this is not a \\\"safe\\\" film Rian Johnson made decisions that will be fresh amd exciting for some but to those dedicated to the ideas of the past it might be too progressive. Not a perfect film\\,the pacing drags at some points but overall it is still deeply enjoyable.","true":true}
