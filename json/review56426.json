Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best thing about this installment of Star Wars is expectations. This is the first film in the Star Wars saga since the original showing of The Empire Strikes Back that challenges the universe. Look at the change from A New Hope to Empire\\, the story and characters grew\\, the risks grew. That is the only similarity that The Last Jedi shares to Empire.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi\\, challenges the concepts of the Star Wars universe. Our beloved heroes\\, Luke Skywalker\\, Princess Leia and more have grown in the 30 years since the fall of the Empire. While my personal expectation of the character arcs is not what is presented in this film\\, in fact in my mind's eye\\, Luke became a successful teacher and the greatest Jedi Master since Yoda\\, and Leia succeeded in ruling the galaxy with Han lovingly with her for the rest of their lives. \\n\\nHowever\\, what a disservice to the universe of Star Wars that is\\, Star Wars is a vast universe that should change and see our heroes\\, new and old challenged and grow. This film does just that in ways that the audience can never expect. To quote Yoda\\, \\\"You must unlearn\\, what you have learned\\\".","true":true}
