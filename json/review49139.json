Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie ever made.I was really hoping it will be good and i have literally never been so disappointed with any other movie.I was sure there is no way to make worse SW movie than attack of the clones.I was wrong.They did it.","true":true}
