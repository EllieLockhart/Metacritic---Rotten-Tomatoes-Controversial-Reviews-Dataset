Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Completely ruined the Star Wars franchise that we know and love\\, with bs political messages that no one asked for. They turned characters into jokes and threw them aside (Finn\\, po\\, etc) and added unexcesary characters and arcs that we didn't need (yes I'm talking about rose and her terrible story arc) no im not a female hater\\, I love females.. I just call bs when I see it. Rey is a Mary Sue with nothing interesting going for her. They could've shown her being trained countless times\\, but no she just has to be good at everything naturally. They completely destroyed Luke as a character and made him out to be a joke........ please don't support Disney anymore as they will continue to ruin my favorite franchise.","true":true}
