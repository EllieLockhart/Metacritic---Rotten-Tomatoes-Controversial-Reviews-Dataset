Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was overall a fun movie\\, but very much an average at best Star Wars movie. It had some of the best action sequences and space battles of the franchise. However\\, I was not a fan of the Finn\/Rose story arc\\, although I can see how it helped set up the film's ending.","true":true}
