Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By a landslide the worst Star Wars movie of all time. The plot and the characters were so bad it's embarrassing. Luke Skywalker's handling is beyond disbelief and this movie doesn't deserve to have the Star Wars name in it. I'm a life long fan of the franchise and at certain parts of the movie wanted to walk out of the theatre.","true":true}
