Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a fan of the original trilogy\\, and of the recent creations with Rogue One and the Force Awakens\\, I was disappointed in the characters and the story. I was particularly disappointed in Luke and many of the male leads. It appears that there is little to find redeeming with being a guy\\, at present\\, as we are depicted as being broken\\, afraid\\, selfish\\, filled with rage\\, and overly arrogant. Whereas\\, the female leads are strong\\, wise\\, sophisticated and where challenged are depicted in a manner where their true good never is questioned.  I'm just disappointed","true":true}
