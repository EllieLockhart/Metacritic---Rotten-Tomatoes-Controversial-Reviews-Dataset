Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best Star Wars movie\\, better than The Force Awakens. I say go check it out! There was a lot more humor than usual\\, which I found very nice and the tension in seeing it the first time was epic. There were amazing action sequences that Lucasfilm accomplished very amazingly. I just hope they do the same for Leia in Episode IX\\, considering her unexpected death. What I see in the movie is balance. There is balance with Rey and Kylo Ren\\, there's balance with the Force\\, the light and the dark. It is accomplished very well. So like I said before\\, go check it out. You will not be disappointed.","true":true}
