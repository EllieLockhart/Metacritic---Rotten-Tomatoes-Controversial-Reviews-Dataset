Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I understand that there are a few making a LOT of noise right now\\, don't let the audience score fool you\\, this is an excellent film\\, my family will likely see it again over the holidays!","true":true}
