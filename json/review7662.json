Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everything wrong with that movie has already been said hundreds of times\\, just look around on the web. Most of the critics are right\\, this movie is just an insult to the fans and a mess in itself. In some ways it's a copy of episodes V and VI\\, with some absurd twists added to prove that it's different (but certainly not good unfortunately). It's so wrong in both ways. This should have been yet another space opera\\, calling it Star Wars was the root of all the hatred it has generated.\\nAs a lifelong fan\\, I enjoyed the original trilogy and the prequels despite some criticism\\, because it developed the arc of some of my favorite characters in the spirit of the saga and had so many strong moments. Now I must admit that except for Rogue One\\, which gave me some satisfaction\\, I no longer have faith in this universe\\, and even worse\\, I now feel like I have to stand against it.\\nEven if The Force Awakens was a huge deception to me\\, I agreed with the people who liked it that maybe The Last Jedi would redeem it. The absolute contrary has happened and now here we are\\, I can't even stand to watch either one of these movies. And what made me angry then because Star Wars was still alive\\, soon I will just not mind anymore because it is dead to me. The only way to change that would be to erase this new saga and make good movies instead. Since they make reboots \/ remakes all the time these days this shouldn't be too difficult.","true":true}
