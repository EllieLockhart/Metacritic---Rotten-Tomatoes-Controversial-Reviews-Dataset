Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For the first time in my life\\, I came out of the movies really pissed off. Usually\\, I cringe or I'm really sad after the screening of a bad movie which I paid to watch. I never felt so much insulted by a film in my life before this episode came out in theaters. Even if I'm not a huge fan of Star Wars (I've seen every movie just once and I didn't like every one of them even in the original trilogy) I was deeply disgusted for the portrayal of the characters in this movie\\, especially Luke. This is an insult to Star Wars\\, this is an insult to everything that is good. This movie is so full of plot holes e really bad decision made just to get some (Gotcha) moments. None of the jokes landed\\, there was always that awkward silence in the room and at the end a ton of people was angry\\, the rest of the crowd were visibly unsatisfied or just laughing (in a bad way). I'll give 2 Stars only because of the cinematography and the acting. It was a really well-produced movie\\, the CGI was incredibly well rendered. But let's face it\\, nothing else is worth anyone's time.","true":true}
