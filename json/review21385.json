Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wish I could give it negative stars. This wasn't just bad as a Star Wars Movie\\, this was an awful movie. I only made it to the end because my theatre served Whiskey. The plot is awful\\, it doesn't make sense\\, and they assassinate the most beloved character of the franchise. I could go on for hours but most of it has already been posted. Most likely\\,I won't see another Star Wars movie in the theatre. I don't like where it's going.","true":true}
