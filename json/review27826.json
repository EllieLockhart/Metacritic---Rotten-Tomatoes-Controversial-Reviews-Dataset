Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Personally\\, I really enjoyed this movie\\, and I wish I went to see it more than once. As a Star Wars fan\\, it gave new and unexpected turns where fan service could\u2019ve been placed\\, and adding more to the mythology and philosophy of the Force. My main issues lie in three pieces: most of the Casino Planet subplot (which was to build world and character but moreso distracted from the main plot and felt forced)\\, Rose\u2019s character (also pretty forced\\, she could have been a lot more interesting and engaging)\\, and how they treated Poe Dameron as a character in his seemingly teenage-esq. rebellion against General Holdo (which was also to build character\\, but was\\, in comparison\\, a bit better than the Casino Planet). Other than those\\, the film was rather spectacular. Luke\u2019s sendoff\\, Kylo and Rey\u2019s development\/connection\\, the fight in Snoke\u2019s chamber\\, the final fight at the end of the film\\, and the encroaching danger and future of the Rebellion were incredible. The scene with Leia flying through space could\u2019ve been thrown out\\, but it does add a new piece in the Star Wars lore\\, albeit at an awkward time\\, given Carrie Fisher\u2019s recent passing. I look forward to see what comes next\\, as The Last Jedi opens doors to new parts of the galaxy far\\, far away. ","true":true}
