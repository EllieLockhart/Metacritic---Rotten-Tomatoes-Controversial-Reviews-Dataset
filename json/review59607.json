The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"After 7 years of waiting\\, and watching NO leaks because you wanted to enjoy the game at your own pace and at your own enjoyment.So you get up in the morning\\, you\u2019re brimming with excitement because the game you waited so long for is finally here. You pick up your pre order\\, you start the game and you\u2019re discovering new characters and that\u2019s fine because it\u2019s TLOU universe. You start playing Joel and nostalgia fills your heart and you save a girl named Abby from some infected with your brother Tommy and you follow her to her safehouse and there\\, Abby shoots you in the leg and tortures you and bashes your head with a golf club. You die. 2 hours into the game.And now you play as Ellie and they make you kill a dog\\, you are given no choice in this\\, and the same dog is playing with Abby. Manipulative much?You play as Abby for a good 40% of the game\\, even if you are still angry at the character\\, you are forced to play her. You understand her journey\\, but you (my choice) still resent her for what she did to Joel. You are back as Ellie and you go on your journey of revenge and you set off killing people who are affiliated with Abby. In the end\\, you are made to fight Ellie as Abby and you are meant to hurt her\\, the beloved character you have grown so much to love.The final moments of the game is Ellie letting Abby live\\, and \u201crealising\u201d that revenge is bad and they we should break the circle. Well how about the other people Ellie killed along the way? There is no lesson in this game. There was no need for this game to \u201cteach us\u201d something. The game was depression.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
