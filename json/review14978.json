Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just saw the movie today and it was an abomination compare to the first 6 films from George Lucas. The writing\\, directing\\, no back story to anybody\\, to predictable\\, scenes from the originals were put into this film and TFA (by JJ Abrams\\, Rian Johnson's perspective). \\n\\nSPOILERS*****\\n\\nCONS:\\nthere was no back story to Snoke\\, he was considered more powerful than Sidious\\, yet he didn't make it past the second scene he was in. \\nLeia may have been force sensitive bit it was cheesy seeing her fly through space like she was Mary Poppins. \\nWhy would like be defiant into killing vader and sidious yet he had no problems striking Kylo? \\nIt was Luke's final stand and I had hoped we got to see him and his Jedi mastery in action\\, but we only got a glance at it for 5 seconds. \\nThe music didn't grip me like the first 6 films music did.\\n\\nPROS:\\nThe action scenes were stellar.\\nKylo Rens character development is an improvement. \\nWe got to see force ghost yoda (but no force ghost Anakin or Obi-Wan)","true":true}
