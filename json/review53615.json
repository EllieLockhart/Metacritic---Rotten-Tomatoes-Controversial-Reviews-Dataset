Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First 20 or so minutes are \\\"okay\\\" minus terrible humor to open the movie. Then \\\"that scene\\\" happens and the whole thing falls apart. Pacing is horrible\\, plot is pointless\\, characters have strange motivations. There's a shoehorned save the animals plug to try and distract how the Porgs are just there to cover up an endangered species that the crew killed accidentally by blowing them off cliffs with a helicopter while filming. Anyways\\, effects are okay and the acting isn't so bad\\, but every other issue makes it nearly unwatchable. I would say that it contends for worst Star Wars movie. At least the previous bad Star Wars movies you could tell that people really cared about them while making them but just made poor decisions. The new Star Wars is just a board room deciding what is safe to put in the movie. It's got no heart.","true":true}
