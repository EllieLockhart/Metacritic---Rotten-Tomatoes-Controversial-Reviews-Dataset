Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some great sequences with Rey and Kylo along with Snoke\\, but overall this story is poorly written\\, very uneven thematically and does things with characters that make no sense like Luke and Lea. Without going into spoilers\\, I'm pretty unsatisfied with this addition to the Star Wars saga. I think the plot issues are a result of Rian Johnson's lack of writing maturity. I was much more excited with the series after The Force Awakens. I hope JJ Abrams can redeem the story in IX.","true":true}
