Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I genuinely enjoyed the entire movie. I think people now think that the progression in onbthe universes of their favorite characters IU s somehow determined by their will\\, but that's fanfiction. There also needs to be a willingness to let the new generation take ownership and enjoy the silliness and such we overlooked when it was all new to us. \\nIn particular I enjoyed the humor\\, the relationship between the characters\\, and the overall world building (trying to not spoil things).","true":true}
