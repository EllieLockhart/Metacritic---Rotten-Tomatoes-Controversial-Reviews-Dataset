Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney managed to take an infinite universe filled with deep characters\\, and powerful overarching stories and destroy any character development and meaningful plot created in previous installments.  Several moments throughout this movie had opportunities to show emotion and character growth but were dismantled by ill timed jokes and tired call backs.  Disney was able to build in multiple opportunities for spin-off movies and find time for potshots at capitalism\\, but not to make a good movie.","true":true}
