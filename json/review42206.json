Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie showed promise in the beginning but\\, quickly unraveled as the film progressed. It leaves the film off in a place that makes me question whether or not I will continue to watch the series. This director definitely took this film in the wrong direction. ","true":true}
