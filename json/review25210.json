Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nice title for a middle movie in a trilogy. This movie was off from the start. do the opposite theory makes the star wars trilogy and future of the franchise suffer badly. besides the filming quality\\, the movie failed on all accounts. do not watch the deleted scenes.","true":true}
