Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed the story\\, the character development\\, and the uniqueness that the movie brought to the universe. It really was less hung up on what fans demand and more of what  Star Wars has the potential to be. \\n\\nTo the naysayers: You cannot expect a single movie in a saga to address all of your past questions\\, or meet the hopes that hundreds of millions of fans have for it. It is literally impossible to please 100% of that many people. Enjoy it for what it is and make your own conclusions (as you already have done in the past)","true":true}
