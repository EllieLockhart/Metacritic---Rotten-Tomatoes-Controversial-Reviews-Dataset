Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie removed the mystique of Star Wars... For decades\\, Star Wars has been about a legendary\\, mystical order which protected the galaxy through a blood line\\, members of whom were trained and taught in the ancient ways of the force. Now everybody has the force\\, they don't need training from a wise master\\, and they don't need the history or teachings of the Jedi order. The film was visually appealing to the eyes\\, but a stain on the saga's legacy. I'd rather watch Episode 1 on repeat for the rest of my life than watch this film again.","true":true}
