{"101487":196091,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When I first watched the film\\, I had mixed feelings. It's like you're bothered to say if you actually think a movie is bad when most critics love it. Then I really\\, really thought about it. I didn't laugh at all\\, I was checking my watch halfway through. I really\\, really wanted to like this film. I assumed it was going to be like Empire\\, a darker entry that may\/may not be predictable\\, but at least rewarded the viewer for paying attention...\\n\\nI think the first scene was telling because it was an Asian character dropping bombs. This is not a Star Wars character people care about\\, so I knew it had to be untangling something. Enter Rose\\, a character who on her own would not be that bad\\, but as part of the second in a new trilogy after 30+ years when every person over 18 just wants see Luke Skywalker...I rolled my eyes. Who is this? And then some heavy exposition to shove the character in the film for no reason. \\n\\nI can get a laugh or two from a Marvel film\\, but I found this movie incredibly unfunny. I think it had all the humor of a lesser Geico commercial. I get it\\, pop culture references. This is star wars. Humor in star wars is supposed to be uniquely star wars. The whole idea of world building is that it is its own world that doesn't even know of earth. That's what made Lucas' films work. \\n\\nBeyond that... I don't like most of these characters. I don't like Rei\\, I don't connect to what her struggle is because we're intentionally told nothing about her. I don't like Finn\\, I don't understand why he was shoved in there aside from the necessity to add a new character. I kind of like Poe Dameron\\, which brings me to Laura Dern's character where I actually thought of walking out. I have no idea who thought Holdo was a good idea or why we're supposed to like her\\, but the movie is making a statement when she is introduced and the camera just holds there. I have no idea what the statement is\\, but politicizing a star wars film (outside of the film's own interstellar politics) is just bad. I get it\\,  Rian Johnson was handed this script and just wanted to make his own movie out of it. Even as a standalone film\\, it's not great\\, but when combined with episode 8+ the past 6 prior films\\, it's not just disconnected\\, it's nonsensical. Luke Skywalker has a map to himself and yet wants to be left alone? Why is he milking an alien creature's breast and drinking the milk? What the hell is going on? I don't particularly love star wars\\, but I identify the fact that it is a pop culture phenomenon. \\n\\nJ.J. Abrams built up 100 different mysteries in his first film and this film basically says \\\"forget about all that\\, I've got your money already.\\\" It's miserable. As its own film it's passable\\, but as a Star Wars movie\\, well\\, I didn't like the pretrilogy all that much but this is just another level of absurd. It's a clear ignorance in regards to the source material and a casual middle finger by Disney to anyone over the age of 18 that has two braincells to rub together. This is an unfunny\\, poorly written mess designed to appeal to people who don't think about things. It's an anti-film. That Kylo Ren outright says \\\"burn it down and start over\\\" is like a four year old reciting a Bukowski poem. He gets the idea right\\, but there is no detail\\, no nuance\\, no tact. Even a little kid can knock all of his food on the floor and act proud about the fact that he's destroyed something. I only wrote this review because now the fringe leftie outlets are trying to imply that anyone who dislikes this movie is a russian hacker. I walked out of the film shaking my head and everyone else in the theater seemed disappointed\\, no applause which is usually common for an opening night movie.\\n\\nI didn't even like Luke Skywalker and I still acknowledge they gutted his character for no reason.","true":true}
