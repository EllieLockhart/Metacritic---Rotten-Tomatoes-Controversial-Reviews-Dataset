Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst star wars movie in the entire history of the franchise. This is supposed to carry on  the skywalker story\\, it doesnt. It is beautifully shot and looks amazing but the film is just pure rubbish. Rian johnson may be a good director but knows nothing about the star wars world and it is painfully obvious in this movie. They got it wrong plain and simple.","true":true}
