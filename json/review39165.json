Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This episode is completeley disrespectful to Star Wars Saga. According to this\\, Luke is just a loser\\, And episodes IV\\, V and VI are all lies.","true":true}
