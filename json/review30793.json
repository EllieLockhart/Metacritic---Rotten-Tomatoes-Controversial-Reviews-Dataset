Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Slow to pick up in the beginning. Flicking the stories back and forth between Rey\/Luke and the star cruiser\/Finn\/Poe wasn\u2019t seamless. I was engaged in one storyline only to be jolted to another. It becomes more enjoyable towards the end when everything is coming together.","true":true}
