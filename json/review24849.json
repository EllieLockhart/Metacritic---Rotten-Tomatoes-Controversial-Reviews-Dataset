Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My Episode VIII brief review: an irreverent\\, emasculating\\, demythologizing\\, ultra-Disneyfied\\, late-modern-centric Star Wars film that had stunning\\, beautiful cinematography\\, wonderful music by John Williams\\, but would have been better as a SW side-story film. Basic takeaway lesson: You don't need parents\\, books\\, or master-teachers to be powerful\\, you just have to be a self-assertive woman. This redefined and demythologized the force into self-centered-assertion.\\n\\nI'm done with Star Wars after Episode VII! Yoda torched the Jedi Tree of Life and good wisdom books!!!!! Really???? \\n\\nHelp us\\, J.J. you're our only hope!","true":true}
