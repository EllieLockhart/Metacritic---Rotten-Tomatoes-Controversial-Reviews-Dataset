Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"it was unlike any other Star Wars movie. I liked the fresh take. Good mixture of humor & drama. As a lifetime fan I understand what some people don't like. But\\, I say give it a fair chance. ","true":true}
