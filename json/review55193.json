Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would like to subscribe to \u201cRian Johnson\u2019s Star Wars Universe\u201d please. Time will only prove how ridiculously short-sighted and obtuse those naysayers are currently being about the unique and surprisingly dark themes that are introduced into the franchise\u2019s 8th film\\, (not counting Rogue One obviously as it\u2019s not within the \u201cSaga\u201d canon). Anyway\\, I can\u2019t wait to see Abraham\u2019s Episode IX in Dec 2019\\, which has already been confirmed to be something different from The Force Awakens\\, as JJ had to use that film not only to introduce new characters while picking up where we the old ones were\\, but he had to undo all of the damage that three prequel films did - those prequels somehow didn\u2019t completely destroy the franchise\\, and I am thankful Abrahams was up to the task of picking up those pieces; must\u2019ve been a hell of a challenge. Well\\, \u201cBrick\u201d and \u201cLooper\u201d writer\/director Rian Johnson swung for the fences here by being himself: by introducing ideas and aspects of the Star Wars plot that had never been entertained or featured before now. That\u2019s kind of a major deal\\, especially when it\u2019s done so brilliantly. ","true":true}
