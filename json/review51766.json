Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A dismal image of the future lacking a real plot. The last Jedi captures none of the magic of Start Wars. Yes it has start ships\\, yes it has lightsabers\\, but the underlying plot is missing. The one thing that could be said about George Lucas was that he knew where the plot was going over each of the trilogies he made. With the two new movies\\, you have the feeling that no on has an idea what the end game is. The first force awakens did have a story line. It was bound to as it was a direct rip off of a new hope\\, but after that where can Disney go. The first order has appeared with no explanation of how it arose after the emperor's defeat. Who is Snoke and where did he come from? Don't expect an answer in the last jedi because it doesn't come. And who are Ray's parents\\, you may not like the answer given\\, I didn't. It seemed like lazy script writing. In fact\\, most of the movie revolved around actions that contributed nothing to the resolution at the end. \\nDescribing the last Jedi as disappointing is a massive understatement. It doesn't deliver on any level except to income for Disney.","true":true}
