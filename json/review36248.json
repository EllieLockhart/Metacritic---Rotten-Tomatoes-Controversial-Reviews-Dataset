Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last movie built up expectations about certain characters only for this movie to completely throw that away. I also thought Rian Johnson's script tried too hard to be funny. The action scenes were cool\\, but too many characters lacked development and too many plot holes to were present to really make this a good movie.","true":true}
