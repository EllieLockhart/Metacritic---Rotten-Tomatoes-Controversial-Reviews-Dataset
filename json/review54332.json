Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been so conflicted about this film that it's inspired me to leave my first review. I was skeptical about The Force Awakens when it came out\\, but it won me over with its teasing mysteries\\, breathless sense of fun\\, and awareness of the source material. In fact\\, there was such momentum going into The Last Jedi that I was quite looking forward to learning more about what had happened and who these new characters were. Perhaps this is why\\, upon reflection\\, I was so amazingly disappointed in this film. After a gripping opening action sequence\\, this film slows to a crawl. After waiting for decades to see Luke back in action\\, we find that this film turns him into a grumpy joke that behaves in a distractingly our-of-character fashion. This is the first of many divisive\/poor script decisions in the film. Then\\, by the time the film finds an opportunity to address them\\, the mysteries from the last film are completely disregarded. After six films relating to the rise to power of Emperor Palpatine\\, suddenly a new\\, more menacing Sith-like dark lord has appeared\\, despite the Sith being destroyed. Who is he? Where did he come from? Why did he surface only after the Empire fell? How did he become so knowledgeable? Suspending my curiosity for one film (The Force Awakens) was something I was willing to do. Completely suspending these questions for two films after the rest of the six-film saga had such tight connective tissue is a bridge too far to me and indicative of lazy scripting. Based on the events of this film\\, I doubt we'll ever have answers that make sense in the context of the overall saga. Also\\, Rey becomes distractingly powerful after Luke (disappointingly) refuses to really train her or join the heroes. The entire film was something of a plodding downer that quashed all of the momentum of the previous film to me. Now\\, the previous heroes have been shrugged off too soon\\, without really connecting me to the new ones\\, and for the first time in my life I find myself looking back with fondness upon the deeply-flawed prequel films and without excitement for the last installment\\, which I find faces an all but impossible challenge to conclude the Skywalker saga in any truly satisfying way. Pros: The way that Snoke was defeated was clever\\, the use of Force telepathy and expanded mythos was intriguing\\, and the kamikaze use of a hyperspacing star-cruiser was truly spectacular. And as always\\, the John Williams score was excellent.","true":true}
