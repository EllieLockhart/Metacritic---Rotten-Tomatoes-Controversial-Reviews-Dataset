Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILER ALERT !!!\\nTerrible turn of events! I hate cheap jokes\\, there's no respect for the legacy of George Lucas\\, there's no story behind the main plot\\, the villains with no background and even more unanswered questions. George Lucas must be crying and willing to write a check for $ 4 billion to Disney","true":true}
