Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is one of the best Star Wars movies since Empire\\, with amazing special effects\\, good characters\\, great acting\\, and some exciting twists and turns. However\\, it's not perfect. There are some problems\\, like the B plot on Kantobyte (not sure how to spell it)\\, which wasn't essential because (spoilers) the guy turns on them and they never hack the ship at any point. There's also some characters who die too soon (preferably Captain Phasma). Other than that\\, it's also the funniest. With an amazing performance by Mark Hamil\\, moviegoers and casual fans alike will enjoy this one.","true":true}
