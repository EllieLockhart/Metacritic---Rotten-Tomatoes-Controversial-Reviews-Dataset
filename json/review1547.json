Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a life long Star Wars fan I am extremely disappointed with this film. All the positive reviews from critics make me believe they get kickbacks from Disney. Everything TFA build us up for is pointless in TLJ. But far worse is what is done with the arcs of classic characters. There is no originality in this film. Rehashed Return of the Jedi story with annoying fury creatures included. Watch the film but be warned a part of your childhood will die.","true":true}
