Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good plot twists and good at keeping the action going. A lot of tribute to the original series with a lot of \u201crebellion\u201d to getting too caught up in the original. \u201cSometimes you have to throw the past away...\u201d\\, takes on new meaning.
