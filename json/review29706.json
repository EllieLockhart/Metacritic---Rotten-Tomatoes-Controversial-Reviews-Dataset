Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson totally ruined Star Wars :( I mean\\, with all the forced humor and wasted characters. Man disney messed up this one big time. These are the times you appreciate Goerge Lucas\\, Goerge RR Martin\\, JJ Tolkien\\, JK Rowling. The real strory tellers. This is a sad moment for true Star Wars fans. :(","true":true}
