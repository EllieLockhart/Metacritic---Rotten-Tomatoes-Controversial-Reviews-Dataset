Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is one of the best movies that I ever see. It may seems like a overkill\\, but I had all the possibles emotions in a so intense way that I felt a deep happiness. It's a movie that teaches  something very important and valuable in the Star Wars' Universe: the characters change\\, all the things changes\\, all the things moves on\\, and the characters change them courses\\, they have good and bad decisions just like us\\, just human beings. They learn with mistakes and teache us to persevere to try to hit\\, despite the frustrations that comes of them limitations. A visually beautiful and deep movie that will be in my heart forever.","true":true}
