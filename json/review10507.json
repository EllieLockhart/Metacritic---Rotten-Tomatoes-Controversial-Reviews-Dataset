Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great Star Wars Movie I dont know what every one was whining about....The OLD GUY HERO IN EVERY STAR WARS MOVIE DIES whats the surprise there...the story is good and well told and it Star Wars not Shakespeare...go enjoy the MOVIE...and if you can do better then do so but you cant so there....","true":true}
