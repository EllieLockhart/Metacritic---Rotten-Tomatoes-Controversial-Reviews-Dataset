Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Another SJW pile of steaming Sith.  Liberals destroy everything they touch. Nothing is sacred and what they did to this franchise and its characters is a travesty.  Millions of devout fans lost their childhood heroes and dreams of where Luke et al. and the storyline should have gone.\\n\\nStifle the obvious propaganda\/SJW agenda. It has no place in the entertainment industry.","true":true}
