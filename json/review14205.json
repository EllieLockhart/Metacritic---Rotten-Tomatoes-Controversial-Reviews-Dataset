Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I get it\\, some of the scenes were a bit silly\\, like the fathiers\\, but remember that Star Wars is also trying to bring in the younger generations.  Overall however\\, this movie had many levels that I am just now unpacking.  Do as this movie suggests- don't let the past weigh you down.","true":true}
