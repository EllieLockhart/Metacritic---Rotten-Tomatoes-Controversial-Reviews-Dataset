Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was great but everything great has flaws. I thought the movie was a good time and I also think that all the criticisms are going too far. Do people actually think this movie is worse than a movie that actually has the lines \u201cI don\u2019t like sand\u201d. Overall a great movie. P.s This was the performance of Mark Hamil\u2019s career.","true":true}
