Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I fell fully confident in saying The Last Jedi is by far the weakest addition to the Star Wars saga. Between Leia's inexplicable space flight and Snoke's anti-climactic death\\, the film is chocked full of moments that leave me struggling to understand why some would purposefully introduce a piece of cinematic turd like this into the world. Another one for the trash compactor. Thank you\\, Disney.","true":true}
