Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"it sucks. one of the worst movies i've ever seen - a two and a half hour long commercial to sell toys.  i can't even tell you the plot; was there even a point to any of it?  and if you're a big star wars fan and couldn't wait to see luke skywalker back\\, well prepare to be disappointed! awful\\, awful film.","true":true}
