Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Personally I thought that this was a fantastic movie. Johnson moved the Star Wars storyline into a new direction and I for one am thrilled. The overrunning theme of Let the Past Die is evident throughout the entire move mixed in with spectacular action some great humor and even a couple of non-canon Force abilities from the Expanded Universe sprinkled in! I'm excited to see where IX takes us AND where Johnson takes us on his new trilogy!","true":true}
