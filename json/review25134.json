Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Never have I been as disappointing by a film as I was on December 15th 2017 when I watched the Last Jedi. The movie feels very pointless and stupid\\, because a big portion of the film is wasted on useless scenes with Finn\\, Rose\\, Poe and Holdo. The parts with Luke\\, Rey and Kylo are fairly good since the movie needed a reason for Luke to hide. Kylo is a more interesting character in this film\\, by seeing him struggling with killing Han Solo. The Last Jedi has it moments but in the overall picture it sucks.","true":true}
