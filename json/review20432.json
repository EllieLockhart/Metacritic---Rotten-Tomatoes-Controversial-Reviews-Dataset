Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I usually love Star Wars movies\\, and I have many friends who loved this movie. The problem is that it just wasn't that great. Deaths felt unearned\\, certain sequences seemed very unnecessary\\, and the attack on the resistance was the slowest chase in all of movie history. No spoilers here\\, but this is not the Luke Skywalker we've seen before\\, and it's not one we should have ever seen. We watch movies to see our heroes overcome\\, not fade away.","true":true}
