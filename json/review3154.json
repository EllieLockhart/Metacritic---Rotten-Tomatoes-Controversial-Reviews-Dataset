Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Basically nothing that happens in this movie advances the general plot (which there wasn't any way)\\, important characters die while having done nothing important in ep 7 or 8\\, the others just stroll along in this endless improbable chase\\, apparently fuel is an issue now in SW and the resistance decided to attack starkiller base in ep 7 (days before ep 8) without enough fuel to get away.\\nYou might as well skip this episode all together when watching the trilogy\\, literally nothing important happens. Might as well dump this new trilogy all together it's damaged beyond repair.","true":true}
