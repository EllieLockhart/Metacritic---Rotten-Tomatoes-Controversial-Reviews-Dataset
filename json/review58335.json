Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A day after watching the second installment of the new Star Wars Trilogy\\, I thought to myself \\\"this film was almost terrible.\\\" I liked Daisy Ridley's performance\\, Mark Hamill when he was allowed to be Mark Hamill\\, and I thought Kylo Ren (played by Adam Driver) had some good moments. Beyond that\\, I felt that this was not a film made for Star Wars fans - and that's a big problem. Its been said all over the internet of course\\, that Rian Johnson ignored the setup put in place by J.J. Abrams and basically made it up as he went. But what I will say is that I went into the theater expecting a number of things and got none of them. I liked the Force Awakens because it was a step in the right direction\\, and because of that I went to see The Last Jedi. But the second movie was not only a step in the wrong direction\\, it was a step off a cliff. The greatest failure of The Last Jedi was that it went out of its way to make me not care about the next movie\\, and that was not something I was expecting from a movie in the middle of a trilogy. I hope Disney gets it's act together\\, I love Star Wars but I do not love what I am seeing now.","true":true}
