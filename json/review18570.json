Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It learns absolutely nothing from VII's mistakes.\\n\\nEveryone tries to pretend that the Force Awakens was flawless\\, which is untrue. I know many who've seen the film and admit it wasn't perfect. Rather aggravatingly\\, the biggest weakness for The Last Jedi is that it's too predictable. And every other minor thing I didn't see coming I found myself asking what even was the point in granting that. Any other details I share would delve into spoilers\\, so I'd do both of us a favour and not mention them. The twists are too nonsensical anyway.\\n\\nLong story short\\, I watched it with low hopes and came out exactly the same. Don't bother watching IX\\, you've already seen it in 1983.","true":true}
