Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was born in the 70s and Star Wars was my most preferite Saga\\, but after this movie I do not know if I will see another Disney Star Wars movie. They ruin everything\\, it is a shame! How they could waste this brand. Maybe the younger and people that does not know the Saga could enjoy it but for a former fun it is like been hit in the stomach.","true":true}
