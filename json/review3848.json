Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bit of a disappointment\\, tried to go for cheap laughs so common in blockbusters these days and was as derivative of the past films as The Force Awakens. Mark Hamill is a terrible actor.","true":true}
