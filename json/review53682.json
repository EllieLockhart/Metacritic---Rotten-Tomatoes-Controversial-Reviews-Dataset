Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not perfect\\, but I still enjoyed it a lot. Mark Hamill was incredible. The tone at the beginning felt off\\, but it became stronger as it went along. It was a story about failure (like in Empire Strikes Back) but there certainly was still plenty of hope left for the next episode to wrap up this current trilogy. I'm a lifelong Star Wars fan and this had some wonderful moments. I don't want to say more and spoil it for those who still haven't seen it so I'll just recommend you go and judge for yourself.","true":true}
