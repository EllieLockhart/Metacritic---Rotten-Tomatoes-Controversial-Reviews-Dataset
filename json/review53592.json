Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic visuals\\, effects and sound cannot save this film from shockingly poor storytelling. Very casual fans will enjoy this film more than serious fans. While it is great to see very strong female and minority leads\\, it is true that all white male characters with the exception of Luke are portrayed as incompetent\\, foolish and mostly evil. This does not effect the quality of the film although it is an interesting observation. Luke himself is terribly mishandled\\, the greatest sin of all\\, and the unfortunate conclusion of the film leaves no chance for redemption. Luke is written as a completely different character than in the original trilogy\\, now a cranky defeatist hiding in shame after attempting to murder a sleeping child in the middle of the night. It doesn't make sense and it is not believable. While the plot of this film borrows heavily from episodes V and VI\\, it is told in a subversive manner which regularly fails to meet fan expectations by design. While fascinating as an exercise in film theory\\, the end result is a film which leaves the viewer\\, at least this viewer\\, a deflating realization that Star Wars as we know it is dead. Even worse\\, the new Star Wars fails to appear remotely interesting\\, the most shocking twist of all. Disney made a grave error trusting the junior director Johnson with this film\\, their reputation will suffer\\, and sadly there is very little incentive for fans invested in the series to continue investing.
