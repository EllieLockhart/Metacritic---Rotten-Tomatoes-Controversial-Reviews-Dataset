Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Anything that felt like Star Wars is gone from this film and anything that felt new missed on multiple levels.  This movie makes almost every facet of The Force Awakens irrelevant by adding completely nonsense sub plots and destroying any part of the main plot that was set up by The Force Awakens.","true":true}
