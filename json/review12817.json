Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I did not like the story line...It felt very rushed...how does one learn all of the force without more than 5 minutes of training? whats the purpose for even meeting up with luke? visually the film was good. however there is this Disney aura about it all I just cant shake off..I think it comes through in the casting...like casting actors that would actually do a great job in a Disney television movie. Also without THX Disney needs to come up with better alternatives for their sound design..I watched this with dolby atmos immersive and was extremely disappointed. This film is just as bad if not worse than phantom menace..Rogue one puts this to shame..","true":true}
