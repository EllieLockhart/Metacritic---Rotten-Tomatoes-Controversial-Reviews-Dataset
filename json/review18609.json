Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It made me laugh in a few places but made me mad way too many times. The plot is full of holes and the worst part was they assassinated Luke's entire personality and core character traits and he ever fully recovers. He never even bonds with anyone in this film. He's miserable. Now so am I\\, thanks Disney. No more of these for me. I'm swearing them off.","true":true}
