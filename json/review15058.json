Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left the cinema very disappointed. As a huge Star Wars fan the anticipation for this movie was off the chart. TFA got the series back on track and now with new characters and clean slate. This should have been Star Wars film to end all others\\, and the critics collective opinion appeared to support that they had achieved just that. So\\, upon viewing\\, it resulted in a very disappointing experience\\, with new characters containing little depth\\, other characters killed off. Scenes with CGI that harked back to the prequels\\, children who may have well be straight out of a chimney in Mary Poppins\\, all backed up with slapstick humour that didn't belong in this space opera. \\n\\nBut above all the portrayal of Luke was just plain wrong on so many levels and no matter how I reconcile it\\, there's simply no way he would have ended up where he does. This wasn't the Luke I grew up with\\, it wasn't Luke in any capacity. A missed opportunity and a sour note\\, ended with an ad for Disneyland. \\n\\nThis was my first review on rotten tomatoes\\, I don't usually feel so compelled\\, but I hope Disney take note\\, this film will still make a billion\\, but it could and should have been so much more.","true":true}
