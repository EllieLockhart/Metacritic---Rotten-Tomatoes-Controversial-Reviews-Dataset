Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can say one thing without spoiling anything from Star Wars: The Last Jedi.\\n\\nIt succeeded at something I never thought would happen.
