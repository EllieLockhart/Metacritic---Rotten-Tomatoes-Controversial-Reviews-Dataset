Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So much has already been said about this train wreck at this point. Most people who are old enough to have seen the original trilogy in theater's will agree this movie leaves a lot to be desired. I'll take it a bit further and say this film is a betrayal to the fans who made Star Wars into the pop culture phenomenon it was prior to Disney's acquisition. \\n\\nEgregious character assassination\\, nonsensical plot\\, rampant far-left political messaging and a clear pro-female\\, anti-male overtone. I could go on for hours\\, this movie has all of this garbage and so much more.  \\n\\nAt the end of the day Kathleen Kennedy needs to step aside\\, she's done enough damage to the franchise. \\n\\nStar Wars fans deserve better.","true":true}
