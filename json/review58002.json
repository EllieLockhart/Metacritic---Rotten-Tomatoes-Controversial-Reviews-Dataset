Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While I definitely enjoyed The Last Jedi more on my second viewing\\, a handful of truly awful moments overshadowed the rest of a beautiful\\, cohesive plot. Hated when Leia (Carrie Fisher) floated through the atmosphere just as much as the first time\\, the telepathy shtick seemed to come out of nowhere\\, and the lack of urgency between Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) and Finn (John Boyega) DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ENEMY LINES was painful. A head-scratching moment was how Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) and Leia spoke affectionately of Poe (Oscar Isaac) who\\, only moments earlier\\, committed an ultimately unsuccessful mutiny onboard the ship. Lastly\\, it would've made way more sense for Kylo to order the 100\\,000 laser barrage on Luke Skywalker AFTER engaging him in hand-to-hand combat. However\\, I still raised my ranking a solid 13 points because I appreciated the storyline as whole much more than on my first viewing\\, the visual beauty throughout \u2014 the lightspeed suicide\\, the showdown on Crait \u2014 and the handful of final scenes\\, which I think helped build anticipation for The Rise of Skywalker.","true":true}
