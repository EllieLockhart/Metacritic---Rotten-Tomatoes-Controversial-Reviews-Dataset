A horror story doesn't work if you have nobody to rootUntil Dawn embodies everything wrong with modern horror films\\, only in game form. The characters are unlikable slasher-bait and I spent the entire run rooting for them all to die (sadly\\, one character will ALWAYS survive--the absolute most unlikable one!) and spend the first two hours pulling slasher-movie-idiot pranks on one another. A horror story doesn't work if you have nobody to root for\\, and so this one falls flat on its face\\, which is a serious problem\\, because story is ALL this game has going for it! Your interaction and gameplay is limited to walking around investigating the environment for \\\"clues\\\" and QTEs\\, Heavy Rain style. The choices you make\\, per usual for games like this\\, don't branch the plot nearly as much as advertised.\r\rThe sound design is only passable\\, and the acting is pretty cheesy and annoying\\, not helped by the terrible writing. About the only thing this game has going for it is the graphics\\, which are fairly impressive for a PS4 game\\, but the Uncanny Valley character models and occasional half-assed textures undercut the game on that front as well. Plus the framerate is unsteady\\, a disappointment for people used to other Sony efforts like Uncharted which are much more polished by comparison.\r\rBottom line\\, this game is over-hyped garbage\\, one of the worst turds to be produced by the \\\"cinematic game\\\" movement yet. The fact that it's reviewed so well just shows how bad gaming \\\"journalism\\\" and people's taste in horror games have become. It's not a good horror game\\, it's not a good story\\, and it's just plain not good. If you have some friends who are willing to chip in for a cheap copy and riff it with you\\, that's the only time I would recommend buying it\\, and even that's a hesitant recommendation.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
