Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very weak storytelling and Disney's need to incorporate cute animals to sell to children are what lost me on this movie. Yes\\, there were some very cool scenes and moments that I loved\\, but they were buried by the lack of creativity with the story timeline... which if you break it down is trying to intertwine random slow developing plot lines with a nonsensical 2 hour long car chase. I would have been ok with that logic if the rest of the timeline made any sense\\, but there was zero effort to logically connect the events.","true":true}
