Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Critics were paid off by Disney\\, or they're afraid to anger the mouse. This is some of the worst writing I've ever seen in a film\\, forcing all sorts of agenda over substance\\, character development\\, and story depth. It takes a steaming pile on the SAGA. The minorities this film attempts to put in the spotlight should be outraged by how cheaply their characters are treated. Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson should not be allowed to work on Star Wars again.","true":true}
