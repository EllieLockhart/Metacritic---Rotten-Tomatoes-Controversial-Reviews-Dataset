Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was somewhat entertaining\\, but a bad Star Wars movie. The overall screen play was poorly written\\, the entire movie lacked a consistent plot\\, had too much filler and there were many holes and voids when compared to the previous Star War movies.Overall Rian Johnson was apparently just not the right choice to continue the saga.","true":true}
