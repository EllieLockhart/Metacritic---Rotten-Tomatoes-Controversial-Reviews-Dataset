Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm so disappointed with this movie. Disney has ruined Star Wars. The most disappointing part of this movie (there are many)\\, in my opinion\\, is what they did with Luke Skywalkers character. In the original 3 SW movies\\, it was Luke seeing the good in Darth Vader and trying to turn him back from the dark side. Luke\\, a Jedi master\\, now sees the dark side in Kylo and tries to kill him in his sleep?!? wtf then disappears wtf again. That's not the Luke I know. And don't get me started with the Finn\/Rose thing.","true":true}
