{"101487":129653,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am still shell shocked at how off course the Star Wars episodic films have gone. Whilst the Force Awakens introdcued new characters and mixed Lucas OT elements with a tiny smattering of disneyfication\\, The Last Jedi is full blown sprinkled with Disney magic dust MCU bullshit.\\n\\nThe jokes\\, oh the jokes. The opening 5 minutes with prank call from Poe to General Hux is one of the most embarrassing scenes i've ever witnessed in a SW movie. More like a Spaceballs scene\\, It was awful and set the tone. Those tony stark\\, avenger style banter and quips do not work in a star wars film\\, it's not Guardians of The Galaxy but Disney have worked it in because that is their formula.\\nNot only terrible humour but the sheer amount of disgustingly cutesy disney animals throughout - the crystal wolves\\, furby type creatures\\, giant stampeding goats in a casino\\, the ridiculous creatures on Lukes temple island. My eyes were bleeding. The cutesynessin this movie made the ewok battle of endor look as serious as a vietnam documentary in retrospect.\\n\\nThe horrific treatment of characters. Snoke's rise to power is never revealed. No development\\, instead he wears a robe that makes him look like hugh heffner and disposed of in the stupidest way\\, wh ydid we care when he was killed. we knew him for a few minutes - the same goes for Phasma\\, who i think died from a bad rebel scum joke - OMG did Finn really say that shit !.\\n\\nRey is a nobody\\, but the most powerful nobody the galaxy has ever seen. Hey she's a woman\\, and no woman is going to be trained by a man who knows better- this has kathleen kennedys feminist stamp all over it. The constant polictical correctness\\, equality and diversity messages hitting you in the face every 5 minutes. Lazy and stupid commentary on arms dealing\\,animal cruelty and high society & class division - this is beyond awful. \\n\\nAs for characters\\,Luke Skywalker is the biggest victim. Now a alien milk tit drinking bum who goes against everything we knew he stands for in the original trilogy. Luke\\, a man who knew he could redeem the most evil villain in galaxy his own father\\, against all of the odds\\,even if it meant dying for that belief. Now he consideres murdering his nephew in his sleep after a brief vision\\, none of this story is fleshed out enough to have any weight. Its all flimsy fluff. His one big moment at the end has got to be one of the biggest let downs of the entire saga. Facing off against a fleet of first order walkers and Kylo ren\\, turns out to be just a force distraction so that the remaining resistance can escape but unfortunately Luke forgot to remove a pile of rocks first. Great plan Luke - you died for that. Only for Rey to conveniently show up and save the day removing said rocks. Horseshit and awful use of Mark Hamil's character\\, beyond terrible treatment. The actually story - the resistance starship is running out of fuel - yep for 2 hours. We have side plots of Finn and new character Rose trying to find a code breaker so they can stop the first order ships tracking the resistance through hyperspace - WHO WRITES THIS SHIT ? Ah sorry Rian - we know Kathleen kennedy and the execs had a chain around your neck to shape it in their executive vision\\, it's not all your fault. \\n\\nThe Finn and Rose mission leads to some of the worst scenes ever featured in the star wars saga. Stampeding giant goats in a casino riden by our 'heroes' like some disney nonsense of the highest (first) order. At this point i heard the final nail hammer into the coffin of star wars for me. It's no longer for me. its for the MCU crowd.  \\n\\nNot only has Disney utter contempt for the characters and the universe George Lucas created but his Lore and mythology surrounding the force.\\n\\nHere the force treated as a joke. In the Empire Strikes Back Yoda explained the force in such a way we were still in awe and wonder\\, here its ' a power that makes stuff float\\, laser swords'. It's the kind of dismissive terminology someone outside of star wars looking in would use in mockery\\, they've hurt the things we love about the saga at the expense of a dumb cheap joke. Now\\, Disney have suceeded in destroying what george lucas has created in just 2 movies. The evidence in wanting to burn and destroy the jedi history\\,that alone is symbolic of disney's intentions\\, which is to wash their hands of anything George Lucas has done and mold their own cute fluffy nonsense from now on in.\\n\\nI will not watch episode 9. I do not care for this saga anymore. It's a real shame disney felt the need to distance themselves of George Lucas's story treatments for episodes 7 & 8 \\, in a way burning them like the jedi scriptures so that they could create -THIS ! I can't help but feel the creator still had the characters best interests at heart\\, they were his baby. Instead we have disney's manaufactured souless\\, madein a boardroom meeting brand of filmaking. Welcome to the future of Star Wars RIP","true":true}
