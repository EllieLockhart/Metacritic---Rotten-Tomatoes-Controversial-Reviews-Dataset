Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"the only thing that saves this game from having a score of zero is its graphics and game play the actual story is lack luster and the killing of Joel would have great if used properly but takes the use of it and defiles any meaning you could have gained from it only being used to turn ellie into a \\\"villain\\\" i genuinely couldn't care that she's lesbian it was introduced in the first game and it makes sense but gleaning everything out of her personality to focus on it is abysmal story writing and frustrates fans of the series many of us would have been just happy with a transgender lead character *which naughty dog now says is actually a female* as a protagonist but its not used in anyway other than a sex scene which pulled me right out of my immersion of the game and trying to act like it was some sort of plot twist but its not its juts uncomfortable for people to watch now to a main complaint i hear and want to address i wouldnt have cared if Joel died in this game it would have been intriguing to see how ellie would have handled the loss of her surrogate father but they turned it into a revenge story where ellie became the villain and you had to play as the sick animals who bashed Joels brains in which was even more upsetting and gave me less reasons to root for them other than them being cardboard cut outs over all underwhelmed and severally angry at this game don't waste your money wait until its 10$ or less to purchase because it is just god awful and completely disrespects the first games masterpiece of a story line and characters\u2026 Expand","true":true}
