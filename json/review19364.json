Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It\u2019s pretty good. That\u2019s it. I don\u2019t know why so many Star Wars fans are acting so childish when it comes to this movie. If you didn\u2019t like it\\, thats fine but so many Star Wars fans are taking the hatred for this movie waaaay to far.","true":true}
