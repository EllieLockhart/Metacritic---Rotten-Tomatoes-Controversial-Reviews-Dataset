Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This latest Star Wars film confirms old fears of the franchise. While certainly well shot\\, it is lumbered with a script which mishandles many essential ideas\\, and cannot bring many themes to fruition. Dragging through the already infamous casino scene\\, it skims over many potentially interesting elements in order to make the quick and easy path to creating a sequel. Rey's training\\, a point which seemed as if it could be a major engaging element within the film is so underdone that it's as if she is barely taught any skills at all. This is an essential problem with the film\\, where things simply happen because the plot needs them to\\, so it breaks the immersion of characters earning their victories over the writer just handing them over.\\n\\nYet\\, perhaps the greatest sin of the film is how it completely squanders an opportunity to start anew. This was a chance to begin a new universe\\, to truly kick-start a new era and try things which had not been considered before. Yet\\, the world building is terrible and it's still desperately grabbing ideas from the previous Expanded Universe and mashing them together in a desperate attempt to create a new experience. We have seen\\, read or played through these ideas before\\, and in almost every case they have been done better.\\n\\nI am not judging what's on the script\\, I am judging what the writer did. Which in the case of The Last Jedi was to rip a lot of pages out of other creator's works and scribble out the names. Star Wars is too big to fail\\, but it's not immune to decay\\, and if this continues at this rate I am concerned it will become the new replacement for Michael Bay's transformers.","true":true}
