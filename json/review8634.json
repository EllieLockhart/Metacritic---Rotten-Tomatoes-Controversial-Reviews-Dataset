Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First third of the movie is liberal man bashing\\n2nd third is a bunch of bad CGI that seems to pay homage to the prequels \\n3rd third (??) is actually lots of awesome action and finally feels like a Star Wars movie\\nRian Johnson puts on a visually pleasing and fun movie. I'm wondering if the producers forced a certain narrative on him for the first part of this film.","true":true}
