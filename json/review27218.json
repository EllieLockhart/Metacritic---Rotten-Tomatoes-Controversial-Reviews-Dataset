Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One star for the CGI and actors who had to show up daily in order to deal with the embarrassment of being in a high school play. Plot holes everywhere. It can be summed up as a director\/writer having the ability of taking the story from TFA and just passing the buck off to the writers of IX to make something of this turd. I've seen all the SW franchise in the theaters\\, bought the books old and new. This one will not make it to my rental or movie queue and gives me pause to actually going to see IX in the theaters.","true":true}
