Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If J.J. Abrams has any sense he should back out of trying to salvage Disney's and Rian Johnson's total destruction of the Star Wars franchise and all of the momentum his first movie created. Even if TFA was a bit derivative of earlier movies\\, it worked by creating interest in several plot mysteries - all of which TLJ destroyed. Instead of having the fan base wonder who Rey's parents are\\, or who Snoke might actually be\\, and drum up interest in the next movie\\, the only Youtube videos TLJ will spawn are fans wondering how so much could have been destroyed by one horrible movie.   Much has already been written about how this is now Social Justice Wars under Disney\\, but to destroy the character of Luke Skywalker as totally as TLJ did is truly the unforgivable part. At the very least\\, Luke should have gone down in an epic light saber\/force duel with Snoke\\, or even Kylo - but they cheated us out of even that.  It is truly sad that Disney did not put George Lucas or someone who truly understood this franchise at its head\\, such as Kevin Feige with the Marvel MCU. Disney should enjoy the profits from TLJ because they have truly killed the goose that laid the golden eggs. The hundreds of millions this franchise will lose in the future will be the Revenge of the Spurned Fans. Seriously\\, J.J.\\, walk away now. Let Rian Johnson get the scorn he so deserves and let him suffer the blame when Episode 9 tanks at the box office\\, not you.","true":true}
