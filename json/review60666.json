The gameplay is lacking however.  It drags on with little to no innovation in this aspect.  The worst part of the game by far is the story it tells.  The story introduces a new characters that is not relatable.  The story places the new character in a scenario in an attempt for shock value.

Overall this game is average.  It\u2019s a game that will quickly be lost in the sands of time.  One play through is all this game will get from the majority of its consumers.  I would suggest you wait till this game is for sale by at least 50%.  It is just an average game worth an average price.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
