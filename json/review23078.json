Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it and I\u2019m a die hard fan. Warning: Don\u2019t read more audience reviews. Seems a lot of butt hurt fans are Spoiling hard. It was a fun movie and surprised me! I\u2019m not sure how I feel about how everything \u201cwas left\u201d but it certainly was a great movie and experience.","true":true}
