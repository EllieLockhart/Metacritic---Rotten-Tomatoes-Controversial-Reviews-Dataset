Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pros: Good visuals\\, OK score\\, unpredictable\\nCons: Poor story\\, off pacing\\, repetitive\\,  unlikable characters\\,  inconsistent with lore of series\\, pointless sub-plots\\, huge plot holes\\nSide note: I felt like the new director used poor judgement inserting obvious moral lessons which felt forced and completely irrelevant to the story. Also could have been shortened by about 45 minutes\\, which would have made it much better. In addition\\, it felt like the director intentionally sabotaged the story-line and character development of the first movie out of pure spite.\\nConclusion: My least favorite Star Wars\\, almost Christmas Special level. Wait for it on blue ray or on demand.","true":true}
