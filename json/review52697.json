Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All the men (including Luke) in this movie are wimps or idiots until they get a \\\"slap\\\" from a woman\\, and all the women are perfect saints. The Luke story is total BS. it would never happen. He spent the original trilogy trying to SAVE Darth Vader because he felt a tiny bit of good in him\\, and now he considers killing Ben Solo because he thought he 'might' turn evil? A shame to treat Luke's character this way.","true":true}
