Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's worst Star Wars movie so far. There's maybe content for 1.5 hours\\, but it's stretched into 2.5. It has more plot holes than a sponge.\\nSpoilers below:\\nThe main plot line is the main rebel ship barely staying ahead of the imperial fleet while slowly running out of fuel. First of all\\, in space you don't have to burn any fuel to keep going. Second\\, the First Order has plenty of fighters which are far faster which can catch it\\, not to mention torpedos. Third\\, they could come out of light speed ahead of the ship to block it.\\nFinn and Rose spent lots of time on a mission which is a complete failure. Zero impact on the plot. It only serves to demonize the rich in a society where wealth is only attainable by selling weapons. They also take a stand against animal cruelty. So brave of them. If I wanted to see moralizing like this I could have watched 3 bad episodes of Star Trek Voyager.\\nSure\\, Luke's in the movie\\, but he doesn't really do anything at all. I can see why Mark Hamill was so disappointed by it.\\nThis is the only Star Wars with no light saber duel. They are used\\, but not Jedi vs Jedi.","true":true}
