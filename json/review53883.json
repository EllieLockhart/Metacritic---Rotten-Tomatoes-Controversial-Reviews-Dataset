Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible\\, Horrible\\, Horrible. Hollywood seems bent on killing off anything good\\, especially good guys. What were they thinking? How is it possible that The Rebellion that defeated The Empire is reduced by movies' end to a handful (like\\, 10?) Rebels? What is the purpose of destroying every last iconic ship\\,\\, killing off every last iconic character\\, wasting ALL of the gains made by the Rebel Alliance and the resulting Republic?\\n\\nAnd why kill Snope? Seriously? And to be killed by a second-rate\\, conflicted anti-hero who is constantly being beaten by untrained\\, gifted-at-the-last-second-with-killer-Force-abilities \\\"heroes?\\\"\\n\\nAnd when did cut-and-run become a strategy? When did anti-matter generators develop critical fuel shortages? And here's the REAL question: when did it become necessary to denigrate men and glorify women? Poe is reduced to a brainless killing machine that needs to be knocked unconscious to control\\,  Luke can't be at peace with The Force unless he commits suicide and Han never develops past a conniving\\, thieving\\, scruffy-looking nerf-herder!\\n\\nHaving powerful women\\, heroic women\\, is the norm in Star Wars; destroying its heroes and icons is not. Out with the old destroys the universe Lucas gifted to the world\\, and proves Disney is too progressive to be trusted with guardianship of The Star Wars Universe. Shame on them\\, and shame on me for looking forward to this movie. \\n\\nOh\\, and to the critics: When are you going to write a review that is free of obvious financial gain? Where is your integrity? Rotten Tomatoes Critics Consensus states: \\\"Star Wars the Last Jedi honors the saga's rich legacy...\\\" What?!?! How? There is NOTHING left of the original universe! The entire Republic is destroyed in 5 seconds! The Alliance is 10 people! Horrible!\\n\\nI am betrayed by the Dark Side; the universe is not balanced\\, The Force is NOT with us. It has departed into a land of PC that has NOTHING to do with the Universe Lucas created.\\n\\nBitter\\, and considering being seduced by the Dark Side...","true":true}
