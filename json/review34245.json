Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"That was great movie.. Rian made an excellent job. He was so brave for creating the force bond between Kylo Ren and Rey. Their interactions was so gret.. the fight scenes especially in the throne room was amazing The way Kylo killed Snoke was amazing too. One finger move.. perfect","true":true}
