Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow where do I even begin with this movie...This is the kind of franchise that brings you into theaters wanting more. Unfortunately the more was replaced with mess! The story line picks up where Awakening left off. Instead of pulling the audience into the saga it stumbles about from scene to scene without any cohesive substance. The actors were great but the clunky script shattered any hope in this movie. Rey and Kyle seem lost in the dialogue and Luke it seemed was just there at times. What the first movie sets up as this mega and entertaining saga this next sequel totally unravels it. Such a huge letdown..Could have been a really good movie but alas it was poorly written. Oh yeah did I mention Leia flies!\ud83d\ude44","true":true}
