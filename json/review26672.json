Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok\\, I too could have lived without the cutsie creatures and the \u201cMary Poppins\u201d Lea. And\\, they probably should have come up with a better story line for Finn. But\\, the Kilo Ren - Rey scenes were well acted and sustained the movie.","true":true}
