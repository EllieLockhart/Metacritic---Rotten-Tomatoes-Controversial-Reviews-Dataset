Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a disgrace and it's far from good\\, I wish death upon Rian Johnson\\, the man that killed my childhood because he wanted to suck Disney directors off for a chance at fame and money. He is not George Lucas and he is a horrible director\\, I watched this movie and it was horrible\\, it is not star wars. It's just not star wars. The franchise is decades old and alot of us are not excepting this Disney as Canon. We have a petition on change.org and I personally donated five dollars and will donate more to see this fixed. Monopoly is not a good thing when you attack film history\\, this is not honoring the franchise.","true":true}
