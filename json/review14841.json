Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I heard some \\\"Professionnal\\\" reviewers are accusing fake accounts to give Last Jedi bad rating... well I will confirm that I did give a 2\/10 because it is as bad as fans are saying. Don't get me wrong LAST JEDI does have its moments but whenever it happened during the story that director decided to ruin it all. And on top of that its doing caused all the hopes we had from FORCE AWAKENS to be trashed. So disappointed... let's hope JJ ABRAMS WILL REVIVE THE SPARKS FROM EPISODE 7.","true":true}
