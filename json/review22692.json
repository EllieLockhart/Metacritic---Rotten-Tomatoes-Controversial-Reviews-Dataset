Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like Prometheus with the Alien series this film was well crafted but terrible in that it had a terrible story full of plot holes and inconsistent logic within the in canon universe and it ruined the series itself if you take what it put out as canon. I'm sure the many reasons this film is terrible has already been explained in detail elsewhere\\, I'm just here to add my vote that this film was awful in that it has effectively ruined not only what is to come in the series but the legacies of the original films.","true":true}
