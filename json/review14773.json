Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have seen it twice in theaters and I can say that I like it but it is not the right direction for the Skywalker saga. Decisions were made that were harmful to the mythology of Star Wars and I am hoping that episode IX will be a course-correction.","true":true}
