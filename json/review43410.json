Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was an insult to Star Wars fans. I have no idea what the studio was thinking. The story was a mess\\, it ignored the momentum of the first and vastly superior film\\, the humour was cliche and childish\\, and the writing in general was awful. Why would the director ignore Mark Hamil when he said that Luke was out of character? I'm baffled by so many of the choices made in this film. The book sea cow monsters scene was like spitting in the audience's face. The Kylo and Rey scenes were good and made it watchable\\, but the rest was just plain poor.","true":true}
