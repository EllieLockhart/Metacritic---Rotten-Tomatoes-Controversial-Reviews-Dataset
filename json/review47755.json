Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When Star Wars came out in 1977\\, it was new and innovative and had a positive message despite the rebel forces fighting overwhelming odds.  Now the Star Wars franchise has become a formulaic waste of bad plotting\\, bad character development and quirky animals -- which could only be described as product placements for sales of merchandise -- and fantastical (and not in a good way) story lines.  How many times should have Princess Leia died in this movie BUT DIDN'T despite the fact Carrie Fisher is actually dead?  Perhaps Disney (who owns the franchise now) doesn't care if they make a good movie as long as they sell merchandise.  Do NOT waste your time or money on this movie or any future Star Wars movies.  The magic is gone.  If you want innovative go to Netflix.  Try \\\"What happened to Monday?\\\" for a true Science Fiction movie -- though the message is bleak.","true":true}
