Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The entire movie felt confused about what it wanted to do. Are we in a slow chase away from Snoke's ship or are we training to be Jedi OR are we riding a dog thing looking for the best hacker? Seriously it was frustrating! It's unfortunate that Johnson thought it was a good idea to kill off one of the most influential actors and characters in Star Wars! Who is supposed to bring balcance to the Force now? Why would Luke ever give up the force and why would he give into the dark side to kill Kylo? It goes against all he was and ruins his legacy. Luke never gave up on Vader\/Anakin and Luke would never have left his friends or Nephew! Absolutely disgusting! Johnson single handily ruins Luke\\, ruins the mystery of Snoke\\, and Rey's past! This trilogy is shaping up to be the worse trilogy and is better off left forgotten.","true":true}
