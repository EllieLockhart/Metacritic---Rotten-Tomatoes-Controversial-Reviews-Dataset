Joel's death was terrible. He should have died saving Ellie one more time. Worst yet his death makes you feel like no character's safe but by the end\\, they literally won't kill any main character. It makes no sense that Abby wouldn't kill Ellie after she was done bashing Dina's skull in. It's not like Ellie was pregnant so there was no reason to spare her by Lev's sympathy and Ellie was the one who killed her friends in the first place. Equally\\, it makes no sense that Ellie spares Abby at the beach. She left her girlfriend\/baby and traveled across the country for nothing. I don't know how anyone can give this cesspool a 10\/10.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
