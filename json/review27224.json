Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One star for the special effects. The story and so called twists that so many who liked the movie are raving about are pure trash. The reason no one saw where this movie was going is because where it went is so completely stupid that no one in their right mind would have guessed it.","true":true}
