Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never done a movie review but I cannot let all these seemingly fabricated positive reviews not be countered. \\n\\nI don't wish the actors of this movie any ill will. But this movie was hugely disappointing to say the least. I can't begin to list out the many reasons why. \\n\\nBut I can summarize by saying that I was glad when the movie ended and my disappointment led to annoyance led to anger at the writer\/director of this movie. Plot was extremely weak and left me with no desire to ever see another Star Wars movie sequel in the future (but of course as a nerd\\, I will anyway... and will hate myself for it)","true":true}
