Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was so excited for this movie and I really love the Star Wars story from the movies to the tv shows to the comic books. This movie was a big disappointment and just weird at times. Disney has huge responsibility taking on this franchise and for the most part they have done it well I think but they did not live up to expectations on this one. Very let down. To all the people who rated it highly\\, I am glad you enjoyed it (I desperately wanted to myself)\\, but stop trying to discount and explain away the many reviewers who were disappointed they are not bots.","true":true}
