{"101487":174941,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2019-11-24","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi betrays the essence of what star wars is and is a bitter disappointment for anyone who still cares for the franchise.  \\n\\nJohnson and Kennedy have used this film to primarily promote their own gender & political ideology instead of focusing on good storytelling and a cohesive narrative. Subversion of expectation is the new norm\\, and poorly placed marvel like comedic elements lower the bar for the movie's dialogue and come across as a cheap way of attempting to appeal to modern audiences. \\n\\nThe cliffhanger ending JJ built towards in Ep VII is deflated for a cheap gag (lightsaber tossed away)\\, and is indicative of Johnson's disregard of the previous films. JJ even admitted in an interview that Johnson disregarded the draft narrative ideas JJ had written for Ep VIII and decided to write his own material instead. The result is film which tries to trail-blaze a new direction for the franchise but ends up burning the house down.\\n\\nOne of the more disappointing elements is Rey's character which hasn't been given any room to develop. Instead\\, we're presented with a character with little flaws and a mastery of the force that would usually take other jedi (male and female alike) decades to master. One must remember this movie takes place literally days after the events of Ep VII\\, meaning that in the space of a week\\, without training\\, she has been afforded a level of power that conflicts with what has been established in previous films and extended media. She's also incredibly hard to empathise with as she barely faces any kinds of struggle or adversity\\, and it's hard to name any notable development outside of her parental revelation that allows us to truly get behind her as a heroine. \\n\\nOther female characters like Leia and Rose Tico don't fare any better. Leia is sidelined for most of the movie and performs a mary poppins maneuver through space which has no grounding based on what we've seen from her character previously. It's incredibly jarring and comes across as cheap and unbelievable. Rose as character is quite likeable\\, but is only really ever used in the completely unnecessary Canto Bright subplot to talk about the dark side of capitalism and slavery. Her questionable high school speech and kiss on Finn at the end of the movement also has no gravity or development and is very hard to take seriously. A missed opportunity.  \\n\\nFinn as well was a strong character showing much promise from Ep VII. His redemption arc from a war criminal to a resistance hero was compelling. Despite this\\, Johnson chooses subverts expectation by stopping him from sacrificing his life to destroy the laser cannon at the end of the film. By denying his sacrifice and by already defeating Captain Phasma\\, his character is now in this awkward place at the end of his arc with nowhere to go. \\n\\nPerhaps the biggest misstep of the film is the character assassination of Luke Skywalker\\, who is reduced to a grumpy old hermit and a former husk of his idealistic self. Johnson wants us to believe that Luke\\, after seeing a glimmer of the dark side in his nephew\\, would murder him in his sleep. This is the character that previously put his life on the line to save his father because he saw a glimmer of hope in the heart of one of the most evil men in the galaxy. It's inconceivable that he wouldn't have behaved in a similar way with Kylo and betrays Luke's character arc from the original trilogy. \\n\\nWe were led to believe from the marketing of this film that the original characters\\, like Luke\\, would play a bigger part in the \\\"end of the skywalker saga\\\" trilogy. We were misled\\, and it is clear these now secondary characters were used for pure nostalgia baiting purposes only. One has to feel sorry for Hamill who gives the best performance he can with the material he was given to work with. One must only watch his interviews where he makes it abundantly clear that the direction of this Luke is a betrayal of the character he helped bring to life.\\n\\nThe prequels for all their flaws (script\\, character development) at least had a cohesive story line\\, interesting characters (despite having flawed dialogue and delivery in cases) and great world building which ultimately made one appreciate the original trilogy even more. The sequel trilogy is turning out to be a mess with no grand vision across all 3 episodes which is an utter tragedy given the resources and talent at lucasfilm's disposal. The fact that Kennedy\\, Abrams and Johnson disregarded Lucas's notes for what this trilogy says it all really.\\n\\nThe last jedi is a mediocre film at best when you take it as it's own thing\\, but ultimately fails as a star wars film. It's a big misstep for the franchise and a missed opportunity for giving us new characters to love\\, a new story to really get behind\\, and a good send off for our legacy characters. What a shame.","true":true}
