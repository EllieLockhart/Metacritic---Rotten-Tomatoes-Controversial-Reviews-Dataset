Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Long time SW fan. This is the first movie that I could not stand to watch and by the end of it I felt it was heading in the WRONG direction. What they did to Luke Skywalker was puzzling beyond belief. I honestly feel I could have written a better story than what they fed us. Talk about wasting the momentum from The Force Awakens\\, even if it unanimously agreed it was a straight rip off of A New Hope\\, Abrahms at least got the timing and nostalgia correct. TLJ was a failure on so many levels it almost deserves to be used a classroom material for new directors as an example of what NOT to do with a well known franchise. The magic was lost in TLJ\\, the force was completely lacking\\, the danger\\, the lack of dread\\, the lack of any emotion. It simply was a fail movie\\, and yet\\, Rian Johnson is still currently working on a new trilogy? I would yank the carpet from under his feet after what he did with TLJ. Disney\\, Star Wars feels far too positive\\, far too safe\\, far too happy and way too  boring. Star Wars always had great evil to fight against and frankly Kylo Ren is not evil enough\\, hell\\, I have a hard time taking that character seriously.","true":true}
