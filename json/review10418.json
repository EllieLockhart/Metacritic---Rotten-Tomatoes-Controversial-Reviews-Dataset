Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great movie\\, with many story changes that keep you interested in watching more. it's flaws are basically the screen time which is longer than usual\\, and the fact that every five minutes a joke had to be made.","true":true}
