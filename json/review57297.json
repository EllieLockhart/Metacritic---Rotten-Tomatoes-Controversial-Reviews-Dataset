Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a plague that should have never been released. I have no idea what they were thinking breaking the successful story threads of 40 years in the Skywalker saga. It also makes no sense to have broken the narrative threads from The Force Awakens. Disney could have made non Skywalker SW movies if they really wanted to change things. Instead they had legendary iconic hero's trodden out before us only to be shot and killed in humiliating ways and replaced with flat annoying soulless characters. Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson are clearly primarily responsible for this historic cinematic tragedy. Shame on anybody at Lucasfilm who didn't speak up during its production and have the humility and integrity to seriously question what was happening. Regardless of what happens in Episode 9 it almost seems inevitable now that one day 10-20 years down the road that Disney will eventually retcon this sequel trilogy and replace it with something better and more similar to the EU. Maybe the events of this sequel trilogy were never supposed to happen because Sidious was screwing things up somehow in an unfair way and so the Whills in a once off fashion decide to reverse all of it....... Boooom! The SW universe is reset to right after the Return of the Jedi. You can now begin making 20 good EU movies. Money. But this shouldn't be attempted until Lucasfilm knows what they're doing.","true":true}
