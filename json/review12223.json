Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am going to just imagine it all ends with #6 and pretend TFA never happened or anything more. I wanted more\\, but unfortunely Disney took a huge political dump on Star Wars and I feasted on the trash thrice. Shame on me this time and the last. I just wanted to believe that I was being too critical with TFA\\, but now I see that I have been played the fool. I am truly heartbroken.","true":true}
