The main theme of this story is around revenge - that violence begets violence. The players may not agree with the decisions made in the game by main character. The thing is... they aren't meant to. You form certain perceptions by the time you're halfway through. Although Ellie's actions are questionable\\, you understand the reasoning behind them. And then the writers flip the script. You (hopefully) realise that the actions of the antagonist are equally as justified - in fact\\, they show more moral restraint than the protagonist. You hated what they did but the reasoning of their actions is the same. It's a vicious cycle which can only end with forgiveness. The non-linear story telling and the pace conveyed this theme excellently.\r\rApart from the story\\, the game design and voice acting was some of the best in any game ever. The landscape shots and character work really are things to marvel at and appreciate. This game does not shy away from violence. It's brutal. Again\\, as it is meant to be. This is one of the most stress inducing games I've played. The score adds to each intense scene\\, raising your heart rate and stress levels with every beat. I'm seeing an overwhelming amount of negative reviews on this site and on YouTube. Majority of what I've heard people complain about is 1) the story decisions which they didn't agree with and 2) the LGBTQ aspects. To the first I'd repeat what I said at the start - you may not agree what decisions they took but they had a strong reasoning for each one. If you can't see that\\, you may have missed the point. And for the second\\, I've seen games in the past forcefully push forward similar themes and it's clear - it doesn't sit right and you can tell its there to make a point. The Last of Us 2 doesn't feel that way at all. It flows as naturally in the game as any heterosexual story arcs in any other game do. If you feel that the developers put this in due to an agenda\\, and that's your basis for hate on this game then I do think you should avoid it on the whole. Play it with an open mind or you aren't going to have an enjoyable experience.\r\rThis may not the sequel you wanted it to be\\, but it's a masterpiece regardless. For me\\, the PS4 generation ended on a high note.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
