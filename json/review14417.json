Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had never been so excited to see a movie before considering the Cliffhanger that was left with the last movie. With all the previews that were released this was going to be an epic movie. A little darker and edgier than the last movie etc.  Sorry to say folks this does not live up to the hype. I can see why Mark Hamill had issues with the story line. What they J.J. and Rian have done to Luke is really disappointing and pathetic. I was watching the movie thinking Like is nothing  more then a grumpy old man.  This movie doesn't live up to Rogue One. There are too many plot lines which made it seems like each plot line was rushed\\, half ass with little cohesion. There are some really good actions scenes but overall I was really disappointed considering how much hype and how little the movie was actually able to keep me captivated. Mark Hamill was correct in saying that this is not what I was expecting\\, but in a negative way.","true":true}
