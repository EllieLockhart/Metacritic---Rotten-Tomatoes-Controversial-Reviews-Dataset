Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hollywood - the industry that protects abusers and s-x offenders - also creates crap and then bribes critics to try to convince the public its actually good. Anyone who thinks this movie is good is \\\"a weak minded fool\\\" and is falling for an old critic \\\"mind-trick\\\".  \\n\\n90% and a Golden Tomato! LOL! What a joke! According to Rotten Tomatoes\\, its the best reviewed Sci-Fi movie of 2017! Think about that... In a year that gave us the intelligent and stunning Blade Runner 2049\\, this dumb pile of poop got better reviews. Just shows how WORTHLESS critics are (or corrupt?).  \\n\\nAlso the audience reviews are no way as high as 49%. This whole website is crooked.","true":true}
