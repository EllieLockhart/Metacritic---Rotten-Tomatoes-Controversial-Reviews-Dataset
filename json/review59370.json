{"40636":"This makes us still care more about Joel with also we have alot of screen time and over years learn more and love him as an icon while Abby butchers him no care even though he SAVED HER LIFE with no hesitation.And Ellie lets her live when I believe Joel wouldnt since she nearly killed her brother tortured him through pain killed him torture and hurt Ellie and killed friend(s) and more and eat some of her hand like wow really smart.Also Joel falls for obvious trap I think shouldve if they did it this way have built up.Also Abby neevr regerets like Ellie when she kills like Joel and we should like her.Also she dosent thank Ellie for saving her and sort of Sam but Ellie prob didnt thank her last time cause she was fine with killing her wife basically Abby is the wrostthing of this game and also they try so hard to make you feel bad for Abby when she dosent care who she hurts when shes mad unlike Ellie very smart but thats my main only big issue other than nitpicks and also Ellie character feels so different that takes awhile for you to grow on her.Also Abby dieing would've improved it to 8 stars for me.Also she tortures Joel who saved her and thinks he deserved more pain even her friend was like the -- got what he deserved like wow I really care for these **** there is great mirroring to the original.But Abby being Joel that boy being Ellie if it was just that 0\/10 wanted to break ps4 buy it on disc so you can sell or trade think so can get some money since it isn't worth digital at all. Recommend this game for Last Of Us fans Who KNOWS JOEL DIES ONLY IF great game well 60% basically everything without Abby...Dont attack voice actor Abby though thats messed up even actors like voice of Joel and Ellie have even talked about how Abby voice threats should stop shes innocent.Highly recommend visuals and character Ellie and killing is SOO GOOD 10\/10 killing though and visuals and some other standouts like Ellie and Dina and when Joel is voice acting its SOO good voice acting perfect highly recommend that part except for weak lines by Abby that feel bad which also why give her and her friend Ally think called once (Sam) 0\/10 in everything since they made me depressed mad never fun or clever or good at least no fun not even in kills.\u2026 Expand","TLOU2":"true","2020-08-05":null,"10":null,"The Last of Us 2 represents how games should be made.
