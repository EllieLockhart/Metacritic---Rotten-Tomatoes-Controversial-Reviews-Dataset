Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Enjoyable\\, fun and good. Not a perfect film\\, has many problems\\, but i can overlook them. Recommend if you're open minded and not a rabbid fanboy who claims lucas raped your childhood. Disney is not the worst thing to happen to star wars. Remember the holiday special\\, ewok films\\, clone wars film\\, EA's shitty games?","true":true}
