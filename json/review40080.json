Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not a good movie and it has nothing to do with them trying do things different. Any film made like this\\, be it a Star Wars film or not\\, should be considered terrible. It is terribly written\\, the characters have no well developed arcs (found myself realizing that I couldn't care less if most of the characters lived or died)\\, and they try to turn every serious scene into a comedy with slaptick jokes and cutaways. This is easily the worst Star Wars movie ever made (and yes it is worse than episodes I & II).","true":true}
