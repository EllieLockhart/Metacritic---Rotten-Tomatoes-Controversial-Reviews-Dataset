Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi's pacing was terrible. You're just starting to get invested into the characters interacting in a particular scene and it suddenly skips to another scene that completely changes the pace of the movie. I understand it's a movie tactic that helps the audience to see there are multiple things happening at the same time. However\\, that is usually leading up to a particular story peak in a movie\\, and it's not used through out the entire movie. This has made TLJ to be a messy movie.\\nIn regards to the story\\, there hasn't been much continuity from the Original Trilogy to the Sequel Trilogy. Unlike the OT and the Prequel Trilogy\\, the ST completely changes characters that had been developed and expanded upon for 40 years. In TLJ I barely recognised Luke Skywalker as a character. He is fundamentally a completely different character\\, and the justifications the TLJ's writer used were even more so far from who Luke Skywalker is. \\n\\nI have given this movie 2 out of 5 stars based on average editing and bad use of continuity from previous entries in the franchise.","true":true}
