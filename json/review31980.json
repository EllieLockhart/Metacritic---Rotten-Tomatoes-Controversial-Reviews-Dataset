Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"******SPOILERS FOLLOW ******\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst\\, the good:\\n\\nThe cinematography\\, music\\, sound effects special effects (except one mentioned below) are all top notch as you would expect.\\nThe cast all turn in worthy performances particularly Adam Driver. The opening battle scene is epic\\, and has a great feel. I really like the new bomber design\\, they arent Y-Wings\\, but still cool.  \\n\\n\\nThe bad... (AND BEWARE THE SPOILERS) \\n\\nWhile TLJ has some strong moments\\, too many of the dramatic and epic scenes are ruined by one liners. The comedy *does* work\\, theres just too much of it. Many points during Reys sojourn with Luke felt like a buddy cop movie and felt like her character had been dumbed down. \\n\\nThe momentous questions like \\\"Who Is Snoke?\\\" or \\\"Who are Reys parents?\\\" are unceremoniously thrown on the trash heap. Along this line on the 'no payoff train' is Leia\\, floating in space and then\\, magically\\, she's not dead. (I know\\, I know... \\\"the Force\\,\\\") except she has never exhibited Force powers. It felt like the \\\"Glenn Hiding Under The Dumpster\\\" trick The Walking Dead pulled on us. \\n\\nThe film jumps around to different locations for seemingly contrived reasons. The entire film ends up being a car chase near the end of the second act. Characters either conveniently (Benicio Del Toro in the prison) randomly appear 'just in time' with no plausible explanation (Phasma after the shipwreck) \\, including the entire First Order army near the end. Their command ships just got completely wrecked and they still land a coherent assault force onto Krait?\\n\\nFinally\\, the appearance of Master Yoda had much potential\\, but again was ruined by corny one liners and a not so great CGI. Again another instance where yes\\, the joke was funny\\, the audience laughed\\, but it felt out of place for the scene and for the character. \\n\\n\\nAll told\\, I liked TLJ less than Phantom Menace. Its the first time I've left a theatre after watching a SW film\\, not wanting to see it again immediately.","true":true}
