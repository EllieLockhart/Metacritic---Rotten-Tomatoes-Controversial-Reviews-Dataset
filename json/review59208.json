And that's all to it.\r\rAnd random plot twist that are created to be unexpected and shocking as major part of storytelling are genius is similar to that every screamer app is the best and most well-written horror. It's not\\, it's the easiest and cheapest way.\r\rBut problem with LoU2 don't end here. Games are not camping stories. There is no masterpiece movie that have bad camera work\\, bad acting and dialogues but great story so is 10\/10. No all part should work together. In LoU2 gameplay is almost unchanged and nothing to sing about. Unless you  consider ability to crawl a genius idea or companions becoming invisible to enemies when you sneaking\\, so developers don't have to create actual AI a great innovation\\, then do you even played action games in last decade? Gameplay is average.\r\rGraphics? It's decent.\r\rBut since gameplay is the same other games of genre have it totally disagrees with what story want us. The  \\\"violence is bad\\, and we should forgive\\\" that Lou2 story supposedly wants to show us is contradicted by it's own gameplay were we doing some garden cleaning. The gameplay that decides to give us several options to kill enemies so we don't get bored with killing them the same way. And there is random cutscene\\, when we get sad and contemplating. But after that it's return of gameplay. That's why if we consider that story-telling is the leading and most important part of LoU2 then gameplay is bad. Because it not only not support it\\, but activity negate it.\r\rIf there is something of lesson that LoU2 gives\\, is that show of how illiterate professional reviewers become\\, and how hard they try to please they friends from industry that from critics they become part of game their marketing. Because if you developer of big game and want to spread some leeks and keeping hype up who you would go to  give exclusive interview? Some additional info that no other have? And it's no brainier that for game magazine the exclusive info that others won't have is the most important. Reviews? Everybody would have them.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
