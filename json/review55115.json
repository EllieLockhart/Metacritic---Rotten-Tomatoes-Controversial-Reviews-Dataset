Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was extremely excited for this move.  Critical reviews over 90%. \\n Reviews saying it was the greatest Star Wars ever.  I went to see it opening night with high expectations\\, and I left the theater pretty upset.  There so many things I didn't like about the movie. I had trouble sleeping that night.\\n\\nThe next day\\, I turned on the TV and it just so happened that Empire Strikes Back was on.  After a few minutes of watching I realized... that movie was by no means a masterpiece.  In fact compared to masterpieces of film like The Godfather\\, or The Good The Bad and the Ugly... it's kind of awful!  Cheesy acting\\, hit or miss dialogue\\, iffy special effects at times.  The difference is\\, I'm willing to overlook those things with the old films.  Nostalgia has altered my perspective.  Maybe my expectations were too high for TLJ.\\n\\nWith that in mind\\, I went to see The Last Jedi a second time.  This time\\, I loved it!   \\n\\nYes\\, there is odd dialogue.  Yes\\, there are plot holes\\, scenes that seem forced\\, and some not-so-vague social and political messages.  Yes\\, your heroes are not perfect and don't always win. \\n But how is that any different than any of the previous films?\\n\\nIf you've seen it\\, and hated it\\, think it over\\, and give it another shot.  Everyone I know who hated it the first time\\, loved it the second.","true":true}
