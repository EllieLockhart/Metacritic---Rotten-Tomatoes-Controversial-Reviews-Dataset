Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie destroys everything we knew and loved about the original star wars trilogy\\, from its pointless sub-plots to its stupid plot-twists; this movie is terrible. The thing I hated most about this movie is what they've done to Luke Skywalker\\, they've turned his character from the last hope into the last nope! The only reason I haven't given this movie the lowest rating is because to be fair the visuals were stunning. But apart from that it's terrible.","true":true}
