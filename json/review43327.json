Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a great movie. The acting\\, the music\\, etc. Everything was great. Much better than a couple of the overrated original trilogy films (Empire Strikes Back). I don't know why some Star Wars fans are so p*ssed. Luke had to die sooner or later. Get over it.","true":true}
