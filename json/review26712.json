Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok\\, the Mary Poppins in space and the viva Las Vegas was a bit much. Oh yeah\\, THE question was a bit anti climactic. (Don't want to post a spoiler). I thought the movie was a great transition piece for a new generation and leaves many doors open for new characters and side stories like Rogue One\\, etc. This movie helps exit some of the old in a good way and makes room for new. They need to broaden galaxy of characters. Another point\\, they copy our history well where evil\\, while on top\\, often makes bad decisions to bring about their own demise bringing hope to those who fight evil.","true":true}
