{"101487":173870,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-04-30","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Death of the greatest Universe ever. \\n\\nI'm going to explain this\\, in 5 points. This is my honest review of this film\\, I watch it just once\\, and that was enough to get these points I'm about to explain. \\n\\n1: The total destruction of Luke Skywalker. Let's begin to say\\, I was born in 1999. I did not saw Luke's trilogy\\, rather I grew up with Anakin's trilogy. However\\, after years of studying\\, reading\\, and learning from the Original Trilogy and it's expanded Universe\\, I was able to learn how Luke\\, is one of the - IF NOT - the best Young-Male hero of all time. You know all that we went through in the movies\\, books\\, tv shows and videogames. We all know his story\\, and one thing is always there\\, is THE FACT that he is the MOST OPTIMISTIC AND HOPEFUL PERSON YOU COULD EVER COME TO MEET. It's truly inspiring how he's able to still have a strong sense and willing to live\\, learn more\\, and discover further more\\, to actually become a greater person\\, which he already was in the end of Return of the Jedi. \\nAll writers who have help to this character development\\, which took 40 years to do\\, it's just incredible. But then\\, comes this guy (Darth Johnson) and actually\\, in 2 hours and 30 minutes\\, kills in every possible way\\, the greatest and most HONORABLE HERO of all time. \\nAnd with his death\\, the childhood of millions of people\\, who grew learning from this character. Disney and Lucasfilm\\, destroyed\\, the most beloved Character EVER\\, without any sense of Mercy. \\n\\n2: The new characters\\, are just not likeable. Let's just say it\\, NO ONE LIKES REY\\, FIN\\, PO\\, AND THE TOP OF ALL\\, ROSE. NO ONE CARES FOR THESE CHARACTERS. The only Character that could actually be interesting\\, is Kylo Ren\\, and in this movie\\, it's even worse than in Force Awakens. All of these new characters\\, make Jar Jar Binks look like C3PO. \\n\\n3: The movie suffers from plot holes and mistakes every 5 to 10 minutes. This whole movie\\, is base on the plot-twist\\, a plot-hole could make\\, and takes advantage of it\\, overall forgetting to tell a great and epic story. I'm not saying a plot-twist is bad\\, we all love them\\, but! When a plot-twist takes the story to a hole that it cannot recover from\\, it becomes a major error in the story-telling\\, that even makes the next movie - Episode 9- totally disinteresting and uncalled for. I don't even care about how this trilogy is going to end\\, I don't. BECAUSE THEY KILLED THE LIKING FOR THE CLASSIC CHARACTERS AND CLASSIC STORIES\\, TO GIVE US CHARACTERS WE DON'T LIKE OR LOVE\\, AND A STORY THAT SIMPLY IS NOT INTERESTING.\\n\\n4: There's not flow and continuity between Episode 8 and Episode 9. This movie took\\, what made TFA somewhat interesting\\, throw it all away\\, to just give plots we don't really care about. What made Episode 7 interesting to watch\\, went all down the toilet\\, making -again- this movie and it's story not interesting enough\\, to actually wanting to see\\, it's conclusion. They could save this\\, in the scene where Kylo and Rey start fighting side by side\\, which actually made the movie interesting (finally)\\, but they decided not to follow this up\\, and just continue with a mess of a story\\, which -again for the third time- no one really cares\\, because is not interesting to see. Hell\\, a 5 episode Anime about a cute girl drinking a soda\\, can actually be\\, more fun to see than this. \\n\\nAnd 5: Star Wars lost its magic\\, mojo\\, beauty and epicness. The Original trilogy it's an epic Opera-saga about family\\, personal growth and seeing the light even in the darkest time of your life. It was good\\, it was beautiful\\, it was magical\\, it was exciting\\, it was something you could relate to. \\nThe prequel Trilogy (even with its flaws) had it's unique in its style\\, by giving the Star Wars saga a different and more darker perspective\\, giving it the seriousness it needed\\, explaining how the Galaxy works\\, how its rules and social structure works. Giving the chance to grow in levels that we never saw before\\, and the Novels\\, Comic Books and Tv Shows really took advantage to that perspective. \\nThis new Trilogy does nothing but selling crappy toys (And the funny thing is\\, no one is buying them)\\, and giving Social-Agendas to the audiences of how Women need to rule over Men. If you study all of the Female characters from this film\\, you can actually see\\, how all of them manage to embarras the Male characters. \\n1: Rey beating (without any training) the Greatest Jedi Master of all Time. Rey beating (not one\\, but twice) Kylo Ren\\, who has been training with Snoke all of this entire adult life. \\n2: Admiral Holdo whole plot. She decides not to tell Poe her plan\\, which gets: the whole Casino scene nonsense; multiple deaths caused by Poe and his \\\"own plans\\\"\\, which happens because of not knowing what Holdo was really thinking of. \\nTo her end\\, making a \\\"heroic-bold\\\" move\\, that actually instead of proving her as a likeable character\\, only makes her looks like a selfish-unworthy and untrusted person. And also destroys\\, the entire spaceships battles scenes in every Star Wars story ever.\\nFemale lead characters are awesome\\, we have a lot of them in the Star Wars Universe\\, but\\, \u00bfWhy are they awesome? Because they arcs-stories actually makes you care about their lifes\\, about everything about them\\, and you can relate to them. They aren't to slap you in the face\\, they are to relate to them and actually fall in love with them. You cannot fall in love with Rey\\, you just can't. You are making her see\\, as a Greedy girl who just happens to owns and do everything. She's not interesting enough to care. Her whole story\\, it's just pointless and plotless. The only Female character I actually started to like in this New Trilogy\\, is Paige\\, because we we're (even in her short screen-time)   able to see how all of her doing\\, is for saving her little sister. NOW THAT'S SOMETHING YOU CAN RELATE TO\\, if you had focus on Paige\\, instead of Rose\\, this movie would had a least a good sub-plot. \\n3: Leia's use of the Force. I have always wanted to see Leia use the Force in the movies\\, since in the Novels and Books\\, Luke actually trains her\\, and she becames a Master Jedi as well. They could use that story in this Movie\\, and they did. \u00bfBut how? By making her use it to: Making her unable to explode\\, EVEN WHEN AN EXPLOSION JUST OCURRED IN FRONT OF HER; Making her actually capable of survive in space without any oxygen; And she capable of using the Force to fly in the Galaxy\\, as Mary Poppins does with her Umbrella. \\nAnd 4: The movie Producers\\, actually claiming\\, the Force is Female. That's just stupid. The Force it's not a being. It doesn't have a Gender. It's an entity that \\\"Flows through all of the living things in the world\\\". It's like the Ki for Dragon Ball Z\\, the Cosmos for Saint Seiya\\, the Chakra for Naruto\\, the SuperPowers of Superman\\, Spider-Man\\, Wonder Woman\\, etc. I don't even want to know what SHE was thinking\\, the moment she said this. What Kathleen Kennedy's propaganda has done\\, to the Star Wars Universe\\, it's just a slap to the face. I can honestly say Star Wars dies here. \\n\\nI'm not interested in anyway on Episode 9\\, if I do see it\\, will be to waste two hours of my life. Star Wars it's not interesting anymore\\, and that is really sad to write.","true":true}
