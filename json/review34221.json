Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"That's how we're gonna win\\, not fighting what we hate\\, but saving what we love.\\\"\\nThis is how stupid the movie is.\\nEmploy some logical thought to this movie and it is truly astoundingly \\nhorrific in both its \\\"message\\\" and complete lack of storytelling . \\nBut it looks nice\\, who cares what happens in episode 9 .","true":true}
