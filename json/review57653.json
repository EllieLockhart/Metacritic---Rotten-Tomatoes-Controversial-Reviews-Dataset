Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Total demonization of classic characters. Changes that would have saved this movie and made it amazing to me\\, even better than TFA are: 1. Tell everyone Rey is a Mary Sue because Anakin's lightsaber passed on all of Anakin's previous force abilities\\, sort of a passing of the torch\\, but that she can't control them and needs Luke's guidance and training. 2. Show that the same ability to communicate cross galaxy between Rey and Kylo was done in the past and that's how Snoke influenced Ben Solo to join him and have that be the reason Luke pulled his saber out. 3. Have Carrie Fisher have a respectful ending by having her sent into the vacuum of space and cut to her using her last moments of life to reach out to her son through the force and tell him his mother still loves him\\, that would have made me cry like a baby because it would have added so much weight to Kylo's struggle and also be the perfect send off for Carrie. 4. No pointless side quest for Finn and Rose unless it isn't completely pointless and full of SJW propaganda. 5. No Holdo maneuver\\, just have her lightspeed in the opposite direction drawing the First Order away from the resistance as a final act of bravery. 6. Show more of Snoke! Or at least give us an end of movie scene like in Xmen Origins Wolverine where Deadpool grabs his own head so we have something to look forward to. 7. Show the Knights of Ren at the end of the movie gather around Kylo\\, again to give us something to look forward to. 8. Don't give us \\\"Luke cut himself off from the force and that's the only way we could explain his not saving Han or being involved in TFA\\\"\\, instead show that he couldn't come to their aid because his Xwing was busted beyond repair and show an emotionally driven Luke who felt everything they went through and saw his friend die but couldn't do a thing about it. I don't mind him having some doubts and showing some resistance to joining the fight\\, but at the end of the day Luke (even an unhopeful Luke) always saves his friends and family\\, example Empire Strikes Back he dropped his training despite warnings from Obi-Wan and Yoda to save Han and Leia at Cloud City. So as cool as the Snoke room saber battle was\\, it'd been 10x cooler with Luke and Rey struggling to battle Snoke and Kylo. Anyway\\, I have about a dozen other ways to make the movie a 1000x better seeing as how this is the worst Star Wars ever (in fact Ryan Johnson just hand the reins over to me next time\\, you can still put your name on it\\, I just want good Star Wars) but I'll end my post here.","true":true}
