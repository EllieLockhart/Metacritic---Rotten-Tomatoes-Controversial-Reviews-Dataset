Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie was a gut punch and totally ruined the mythos of star wars. all the setup jj did in force awakens was just dropped by rian Johnson. He just dropped it. movie had so much potential. overall left the theater feeling like rian johnson slapped  me\\, yelled \\\"surprise Mofo\\\"\\, and hoped i enjoyed it...zero stars....2 thumbs down!!","true":true}
