Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like it more than I dislike it. Felt pretty disappointed and not completely satisfied. Very good and interesting scenes with Rey\\, Luke\\, Kylo and Snoke\\, but unfortunately also some uninteresting scenes with Finn and Rose. This film leaves me not looking forward to IX as much as I'd have wanted it to since the plot could have taken a very interesting\\, refreshing\\, new turn but the film decided against it and so we're (probably\\, who knows?) left with the same story for IX as in the previous films. But... liked it.","true":true}
