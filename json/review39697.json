Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a fantastic movie\\, perhaps the best Star Wars movie yet.  I think many of the bad reviews are from people who just didn't get it. The fundamental message is about how spiritual non-duality is the only way to truly be able to overcome evil in the world.  It did a brilliant job of exploring the trials and pitfalls of trying to fight evil through Luke's story.  If you didn't like it\\, read a bit about Dzochen in Buddhism and then watch the movie again.  Heros and martyrs can only slow down evil\\, not transform it.","true":true}
