Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I give this 2 stars because it is a Star Wars Movie. They have completely destroyed the lore they built in the force awakens and have made this movie a mess! Awful stuff! The sub plot was awful and the resistance yo remove a character like Leia was terrible. Does she have force powers now? No! They made Rey way to strong with 0 training. I am scared for all future Star Wars films as this was very disappointing. Waited 2 years for nothing but more unanswered questions. Don\u2019t even get me started on killing off Snoke who (we thought) was the main villain. Awful! ","true":true}
