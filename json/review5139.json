Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Daisy Ridley is exceptional at playing Rey. I truly believe that no one can perfectly play Rey like she does. Also\\, she\u2019s really hot\\, so it adds to it a lot. This latest installment in the Star Wars franchise is amazing! ","true":true}
