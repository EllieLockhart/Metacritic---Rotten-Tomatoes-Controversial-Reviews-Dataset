Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars and I are the same age- I grew up on it and I am a lifelong fan. Not a Disney basher here\\, either.
