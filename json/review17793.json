Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It felt like 2 movies.  One was Rian's dark indie take on Jedi hypocrisy while the other was Disney's obvious attempt at pushing a PC agenda on a foreign audience.  Both were bizarre and distracting.  Rian's take on the force was bleak and subjective for the sake of being edgy\\, with bad humor and awkward edits peppered between every good moment.  And there were good moments - REALLY good moments that would make a second viewing bearable.  As a fan of the original trilogy\\, I couldn't help but feel Disney's rushed and obvious attempt at erasing all the things that make the franchise prolific.  They even have Yoda make a cameo to wink wink at the audience when reminding Luke it's okay to burn ancient books and forget about the Jedi.  They not only want Hamill's Luke out of the picture\\, they want to completely re-write the mythos of the force.  To what end?  Who knows.  But when it's painfully obvious your franchise hates its original heroes\\, it's hard to suspend disbelief for flimsy characters like Rey\\, Finn\\, Po and Kylo.  (And don't get me started on Rose..)","true":true}
