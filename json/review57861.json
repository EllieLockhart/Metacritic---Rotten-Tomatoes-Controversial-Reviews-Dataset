Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well for the little boy who saw the first film in Winnipeg in 1976 and raved to his school friends in Glasgow who hadn?t even heard of Star Wars\\, this was the most perfectly conceived culmination. Characters worthy of Euripides and Shakespeare\\, an almost perfect script and flawless performances. Much has been made of Carrie Fisher?s farewell and indeed it is intensely moving\\, but so is Luke?s and Han?s in the last film. It deserves to be seen for what it is - the end of a Homeric journey in storytelling which really has no parallel in our cynical culture. See it and be prepared to weep.","true":true}
