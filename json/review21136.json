Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was thoroughly disappointed at The Last Jedi\\, I have seen all of the Star Wars on release day since 2005 and this is the first movie that no one clapped at the end\\, everyone just had a look of confusion or disappointment.\\n\\nOne of the worst criticism i have is that the movie is filled with attempted humor which turns otherwise serious scenes into a joke\\, The humor mostly falls flat and just seems like a disrespect to the franchise.\\n\\nThe finn scenes are just complete fillers and turn out to be a complete waste of time in the end\\, They also botched Luke badly\\, They didn't give the character a proper story arch and just mess around with the character so much that you forget its the same Luke Skywalker from the original trilogy.\\n\\nThe movie was absolutely not worth the 2 year wait\\, The director tried to mess with the formula so much that it does not even feel like Star Wars.","true":true}
