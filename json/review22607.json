Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Life long fan of the franchise\\, long story short this ruined Star Wars for me. When I go back to watch all the movies in order this one will be gladly skipped\\, it's a shame Rian didn't watch the force awakens until after writing the script. TRULY DISAPPOINTING:(","true":true}
