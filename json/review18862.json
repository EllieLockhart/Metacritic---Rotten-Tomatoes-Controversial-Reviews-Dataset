Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's another remake.  Copies Empire scene for scene and ROTJ Luke\/Vader confrontation where the bad guy kills his master. Nothing original and no risks. Played it safe to a fault except w\/ the Luke character\\, which ended up backfiring. Messages are constantly contradicting themselves and are muddled. Do Not See.","true":true}
