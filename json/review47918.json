Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While I didn't find this installment to be the worst star wars movie ever made\\, I also didn't find it to be the best either. It was sort of meh for me. I like how Disney isn't just copy and pasting like it's been doing the past 2 years and they're expanding their horizons though. I don't want to spoil anything\\, but some parts seem badly scripted\\, slow\\, and boring whilst other parts were pretty entertaining. I would rate this as about similar in entertainment value to Attack of the Clones.","true":true}
