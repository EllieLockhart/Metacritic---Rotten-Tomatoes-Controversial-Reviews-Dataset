Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First time reviewer\\, and only postig because I shockingly believed the so called professional critics reviews. They are so obviously bought.\\n\\nWhoever made this movie obviously does not love Star Wars\\, or understand it. \\n\\nI'm grossly disappointed in more or less every aspect of this movie\\, but most off all how it destroys the star wars universe.\\n\\nYou no longer have to work hard and long to master the force\\, it's doled out like candy\\, the younger the more powerful. I'm sure that is appealing to all millennials out there...\\n\\nInstead of a coherent movie disney stuffed it full of stuff they can merchandise.\\n\\nThe awful treatment of the original characters\\, and the almighty and \\\"perfect\\\" Ray who is not really likeable. Only Kylo Ren brings out any feelings at all of the remaining characters.. \\n\\neveryone else has said all these thingsand more so much better.\\n\\nBut some aspects of this movie are so disturbing\\, it frankly pisses me off. I would be just as pissed off if superman started farting cruising missiles\\, or batman suddenly became bulletproof without his suit\\, or spiderman regrowing cut off limbs...   Or the hobbit movie featured minions just because they are cute and merchandiseable.\\n\\nYou don't even need to be a hardcore SW fan to see the flaws and that the universe is broken...  and an unsalvageable mess. There is no reason left to see any more installments\\,.","true":true}
