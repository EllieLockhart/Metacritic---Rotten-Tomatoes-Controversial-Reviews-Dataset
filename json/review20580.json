Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never left a review on rotten tomatoes before. In fact\\, I only logged in to leave some love for perhaps my favorite Star Wars movie to date. This movie does not deserve the hate it's getting. Rian Johnson did an excellent job of shaking up the Star Wars universe we know and love by adding layered storytelling and complex characters while still staying true to the overarching classic themes of love\\, hope and redemption. The acting is incredible\\, especially from Driver and Ridley\\, and the comedic moments made me laugh out loud more than once. Honestly this was just a well-crafted film and a breath of fresh air to the Star Wars saga.","true":true}
