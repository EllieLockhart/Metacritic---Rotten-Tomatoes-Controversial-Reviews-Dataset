Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cheesey lightsaber duels\\, poor special effects\\, weak story\\, this film was a failure in so many ways! Luke's story is awful. Projection duel? What a weenie way to kill off the franchise's most iconic character? Rey is all of a sudden afraid of Kylo Ren? She beat the snot out of him in the previous flick! Story wandered aimlessly into plots that went nowhere and\/or were just dull. I.e. Luke training Rey\\, The pointless trip looking for the codebreaker\\, Kylo trying to nuke Luke. This is by far the worst film in the whole franchise!","true":true}
