{"101487":199884,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-03-16","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yikes\\, this film is so controversial with fans. Either this is a masterpiece or a heap of garbage. It sure isn't either of those. It is quite flawed\\, but has no ridiculously offensive changes from the previous entries. Rey\\, Phasma\\, Kylo Ren\\, Finn\\, and Poe Dameron return after a rather enjoyable previous film. Despite a jarring\\, but exciting cameo\\, Mark Hamill returns as the iconic hero\\, Luke Skywalker\\, and so does the sadly deceased Carrie Fisher as Leia. The action is quite impressive at most parts\\, especially the duel between Kylo and Rey versus the Praetorian guards. This film goes in so many crazy places that I'm surprised this wasn't cut to shreds like say\\, Justice League. The sudden caring side of Kylo honestly took my surprise\\, but to be totally honest\\, why?? He was so close to returning to the light side\\, and just went to back to evil warlord again. Also\\, Rose and Holdo were totally unneeded additions. I know diversity is important\\, but their performances were pretty boring. Phasma had a little more screen time than in TFA\\, but went out almost as lamely as Boba Fett. Rey gave a decent performance\\, but wasn't as exciting as before. Finn's dynamic with his peers is just as present\\, and is far more heroic. Poe is more of an idiot\\, and was written poorly. Luke was amazing. He embodied what it meant to be a Jedi knight. Dare I say\\, he was a better mentor than Alec Guinness's \\\"Ben\\\" Kenobi. Kylo Ren was great as well. He was amazingly villainous\\, and was truly intimidating and powerful. He wasn't as edgy and defiant as he was in TFA fortunately. Serkis was a fine Snoke for his limited screen time\\, but he deserved more background\\, maybe lots of background would have helped. Sadly\\, the Rey parent reveal was disappointing. She couldn't be a nobody. She is a great warrior. How could she just be the offspring of some wasted alcoholics? All weaknesses aside\\, it is a good Star Wars movie\\, but not on the same level as say\\, Sith or Empire. 7\/10","true":true}
