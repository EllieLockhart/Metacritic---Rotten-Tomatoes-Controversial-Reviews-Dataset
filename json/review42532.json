Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was an absolute flop for multiple reasons. (SPOILERS AHEAD)\\n\\nTo start\\, dry humor is continuously forced down your throat in the beginning of the movie\\, only to suddenly drop off without warning. It is awkward and poorly paced.\\n\\nPeople outside of the Skywalker family having Force abilities IS NOT new. It has been established in canon multiple times. It is nit groundbreaking or revolutionary. It is just untasteful repitition in attempt to be quirky.\\n\\nThe destruction and regression of the charatcers is another huge thing. Remember\\, this movie takes place a day after TFA and is about a span of a week. Rey\\, who absolutely DESPISED Kylo to begin with\\, ships herself into the enemy's hands because she has apparently forgotten all of the stuff Kylo put her through. Leia barely bats an eye after losing her husband AND her brother literally days apart. Also she suddenly gives you on her son\\, literally after stating that she believes there is still good in him?\\n\\nLuke. Possibly the worst. A man who saw the good in his father\\, who killed children and innocents atop many other things\\, when no one else would. Luke would never DARE think about killing a SLEEPING CHILD\\, who hadn't even turned to the dark yet\\, because he was \\\"scared\\\". \\n\\nFinn barely developed and that is sad. Have you all forgotten that Finn came from nothing? And yet Rian reduces him to practically nothing.\\n\\nGeneral Hux did not fear Kylo or Snoke and was terrifying\\, yet he's reduced to a coward and a comedic relief.\\n\\nSnoke and Phasma were unceremoniously killed off after greatly teasing their importance and the mystery surrounding them.\\n\\nAlso\\, the forced romance was NOT needed\\, it was actually repulsive. Kylo abused Rey and manipulated her\\, yet she feels compelled to help him and symphathize with him? Rose suddenly loves Finn after knowing him for two days? Yikes.\\n\\nAnd ultimately\\, Star Wars has ALWAYS been about family. If you want something new\\, then the Skywalker epilogue isn't for you.\\n\\nLet me make it clear that the reviews for this movie aren't bad because some \\\"men despise the female lead\\\". If it was truly about that\\, then TFA would have suffered the same way. This isn't just a bad Star Wars movie\\, it is just a bad movie in general. Rian Johnson has poor writing abilities. It was his job to tie TLJ to TFA\\, yet he chose to ignore almost everything and made something that lacks continuity.\\n\\nI would suggest not wasting your money and time on this movie.","true":true}
