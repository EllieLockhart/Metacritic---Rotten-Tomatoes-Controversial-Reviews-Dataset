Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After TFA\\, I was kind of worried that nuWars would supplant Star Wars in peoples' hearts and minds. Would the Resistance replace The Rebellion? Would the First Order replace the Empire? Would BB-8 replace R2?\\n\\nAfter the dumpster fire that was TLJ I realized I need not have worried. Rian Johnson took what was a guaranteed home run\\, and tripped over his own dick. Instead of a movie\\, I got a 2+ hour PSA on feminist and anti-capitalist ideology - from the freaking evil empire Disney no less!","true":true}
