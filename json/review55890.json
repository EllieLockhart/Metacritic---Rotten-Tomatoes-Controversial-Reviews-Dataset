Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really? People thought it was good? Seriously! No one was bothered by the dire dialogues\\, lack of any kind of originality and a new version of the Ewoks!? I mean the whole Luke teaching Rey how to be a jedi last for forever and in fact he refuses to teach her\\, she leaves\\, yet still becomes a Jedi\\, the last one\\, without any training. Snoke's dialogue was possibly the worst tripe ever spewed up in a Starwars movie! \\\"Pathetic child. I cannot be betrayed\\, I cannot be beaten. I see his mind\\, I see his every intent.\\\" yet 2 seconds later he's dead and for someone who is equal to the Emperor for power\\, his death was the cheesiest-script-wrote-in-1-min cr@p I've ever seen in starwars\\, like I'd prefer to listen to Jarjar. The whole plot is just lacking any depth\\, any character development\\, originality (they couldn't even think of a new base for the final fight\\, except they replaced the snow with red sand hidden by snow until you walk on it... WTF???)\\, you name it\\, it ain't there. Talk about using an existing franchise just to make money... they really could have done something great\\, but no\\, it was put together in 5 mins... starwars I was bad\\, but at least Lucas tried to do give the franchise a new look. Episode XIII offers nothing at all and half a star is very very generous.","true":true}
