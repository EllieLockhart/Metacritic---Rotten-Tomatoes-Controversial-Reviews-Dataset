Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One character's substantial lack of logic made way for the second half of the movie. Which is very annoying and not at all in character for Rian Johnson. \\n\\nDespite that I still liked it.","true":true}
