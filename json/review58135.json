Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wouldn't say the best star wars movie. Bringing up new characters but abandoning old ones or making serious characters a comic relief made the movie distasteful. Rian Johnson could have done a lot of things differently. This had the potential to be one of the best but ended up being equal to the prequels.","true":true}
