Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is amazingly BAD! This is NOT a Star Wars movie\\, it is a JOKE! Every single aspect of the Mytology is destroyed for NO REASON\\, there are PLOT HOLES everywhere\\, there is a very evident feminist agenda\\, absurdity everywhere\\, misplaced humor\\, the characters are NOT well developed\\, and the movie does not go anywhere. It is really bad.","true":true}
