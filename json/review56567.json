{"101487":175177,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2019-02-19","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a good \\\"mindless entertainment\\\" type film. Despite the \\\"themes\\\" found within the movie\\, it feels like it wants you to watch it without really thinking about what is going on. When I watched it\\, I would question why the characters are making the decisions they make and the only logical solution I could come to was that it was happening because the plot needed\/wanted it to happen. Holdo not telling Poe the plan drives the story forward. There is no reason why this doesn't happen\\, it just does. Rey wanting to save Kylo after hating him in the Force Awakens and first half of the Last Jedi doesn't make no sense and yet we need Snoke to die\\, we need the throne room scene. The characters make poor decisions which enables the plot to move forward (removing the shields from the Hanger and Bridge for instance\\, Hux not hyperspacing ahead of the Resistance\\, Holdo hyperspacing the First Order fleet...). The movie is visually stunning and the acting is good but the plot does not work when you start examining it. When you examine the context of Luke and Rey's joke\\, it does not make a lot of sense considering the fact that they know their friends are depending on this mission. Your best friend is dead\\, but instead of mourning\\, your gonna make a joke\\, going from a serious grumpy old man to a funny old man and then back to a serious grumpy old man. It is bloated with jokes that conflict with how you should feel as you watch it. They come not from a comic relief character but from every character at some point in the movie. If you like to not think about things\\, this is a movie for you. But if you like to analyze things while watching something in order to enjoy it more\\, this isn't for you. Finally\\, it has\\, arguably\\, the worst choreography in Star Wars. It tried to combine the speed of the prequels with the heart of the OT and it failed. It comes off more as a dancer then the prequels. A dagger is edited out which enables Rey to survive\\, a guard throws his sword away before he is stabbed by Kylo. Rey doges a swing to late so the sword is arched above her so it doesn't kill her. Kylo stabs the ground and a guard hits his lightsaber because it needs to happen. Three guards aim at the same place only to be all kicked away by Rey. The prequels had force sensitive people battling each other which made them work more then this.","true":true}
