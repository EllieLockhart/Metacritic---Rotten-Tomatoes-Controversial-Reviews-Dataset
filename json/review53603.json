Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Felt the whole movie was a rushed with too many pointless or open ended plot twists. Lots of CGI and action scenes that looked really cool but felt like empty movie filler and didn't do the film much justice on the whole.  Don't get me wrong here there were a lot of beautiful scenes in this movie but Rian Johnson doesn't hold a candle to George Lucas in terms of how to make those scenes more impactful. Disney was trying so hard to sell toys in this movie which made everything feel so cheap. In my mind this is the first star wars movie that wasn't a real movie. It was just an advertisement to sell toys for children. I feel star wars is over for me now cause I can't watch a 2 hour ad for children's toys. That's not what star wars movies are about. Something Disney clearly will never understand. Sorry guys. I've watched these movies my whole life but its over for me now. I'm ready to let it go.","true":true}
