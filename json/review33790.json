Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie.  The plot holes were glaring\\, too many characters were killed off with the remaining ones not having enough depth to replace them\\, and it made Luke out to be an emo crybaby and Kylo out to be some goth kid mad at mom and dad.  It was like a movie made for 8-year-olds\\, or\\, better yet\\, to sell as much march as possible to 8-year-olds.","true":true}
