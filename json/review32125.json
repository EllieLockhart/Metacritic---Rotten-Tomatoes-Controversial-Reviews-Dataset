Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(Spoilers) This movie was really amazing\\, and even brought a couple tears to my eyes when Luke died\\, I can't believe some people hate it so much\\, I can't wait till the 9th movie comes out. Don't listen to the judgmental comments out there because they are just being critical. Plus\\, you shouldn't expect Luke to be the person he was when he was 20 or so because this is like 40 years later! So please just remember that you can't expect a movie to be the way that you want it to be.","true":true}
