Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The actual plot has some weakness and problems\\, but there are some really nice moments\\, so I'm not willing to drive a bus over it. That may be damning it with faint praise\\, or not.","true":true}
