Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi has so many opportunities to make a great story that would leave fans and newbies satisfied\\, yet every single time it failed. It had useless plot lines\\, characters that were unimportant yet were given the spotlight\\, and frankly just bad storytelling.","true":true}
