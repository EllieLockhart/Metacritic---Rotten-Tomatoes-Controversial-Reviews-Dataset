Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Boring from start to finish. The only character with any development is Kylo Ren and the movie is just downright cringeworthy and ridiculous in many places. And logic was completely thrown out the window with things such as the character of Luke and Leia's abilities. The vast majority of sub plots were nothing but wasted time and often bogged down by an obvious agenda of social commentary. You could cut everyone out of this movie but Rey\\, Luke and Kylo\\, and so long as there were some extras running around it'd be the same ending. Also Snoke might as well have never existed.","true":true}
