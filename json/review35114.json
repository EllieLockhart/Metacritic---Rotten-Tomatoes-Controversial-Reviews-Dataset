Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The force awakens did nothing original and was a disappointment. Rogue One was amazing and deserves its place alongside the original trilogy\\, The Last Jedi destroyed the characters that were part of my childhood. I'm not disappointed with the movie\\, I'm mad as hell about it.","true":true}
