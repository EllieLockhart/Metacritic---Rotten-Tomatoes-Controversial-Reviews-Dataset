Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely horrible.  Completely ridiculous.\\n\\nI know there's been claims of a hijack of ratings for the film.  If that's true then it's silly.  This film is terrible enough that I can't see how it wouldn't get bad rating.  Although the critic scores do amaze me.  Clearly they're being paid for ratings.\\n\\nIf Kathleen Kennedy still has a job after this\\, I'll be amazed.  And if Rian Johnson gets handed the keys to a full trilogy of his own then Disney execs must be smoking something insane.  I won't say don't see it because people will go see it naturally.  But when the next one bombs they shouldn't blame JJ\\, or whoever does it.  It'll be this movie that did it and no amount of box-office figures argument will be able to hide this movie's terrible failure.\\n\\nQuick message to JJ Abrams.  Don't do it mate.  It's a trap.  Step back and leave it to some other idiot.  It might be savable on an individual movie basis.  But this trilogy is down the pan and the best that could happen now is the last movie is decent as a stand alone and I'm not sure why any director would want to be associated with it.\\n\\nAlso the reason they didn't put \\\"I have a bad feeling about this\\\" in the movie must have been because a lot of us had that before t came out.  It wasn't exactly what I thought might happen.  It was much worse than that.","true":true}
