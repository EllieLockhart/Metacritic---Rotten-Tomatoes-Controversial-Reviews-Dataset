Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such a wasted opportunity. They got Luke completely wrong. They gave Leia superpowers in a scene they stole from Guardians of the Galaxy. The whole casino planet was straight out of the prequel trilogy. They killed a major character for no meaningful reason... I could go on. This is the worst Star Wars movie since Phantom Menace. I can't believe they gave this hack a new trilogy.","true":true}
