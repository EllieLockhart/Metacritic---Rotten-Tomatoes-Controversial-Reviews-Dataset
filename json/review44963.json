Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Uh\\, guys... I think I just saw The Empire Strikes Back all over again. I've seen the negative reviews here on Rotten Tomatoes and wanted to dismiss them\\, but it's true. ALL OF IT. From the opening onwards\\, I find that there is too much forced humour for what should have been the darkest part of the trilogy. Snoke's reveal was terrible. I was expecting someone as menacing as Emperor Palpatine\\, but instead we got Goldmember. There's also a lot of slapping in this movie\\, which is ultimately what us\\, the fans got for their money; a slap in the face. You don't even need to watch Episode IX to know how it ends. The First Order is defeated\\, and Kylo Ren is brought back to the light side of the force. After all\\, there's only one person controlling Kylo Ren's destiny now; himself.","true":true}
