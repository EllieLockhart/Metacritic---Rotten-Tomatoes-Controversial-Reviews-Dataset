Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't believe how shitty\\, soulless and cheesy this movie is... the dialogues are just stupid... the good characters are killed in dumb ways and bad characters get all the attention... The whole time I was like \\\"the fuck is going on here?\\\" No! Just no! The Force Awakens was really awful... but this movie is a hundred times worse! Don't waste your money watching this garbage\\, believe me\\, only a blind crazy person can defend this huge pile of bad scripting and dialogues.\\n\\nIt's just a perfect sample of Sloppy and lazy storytelling\\, really can't believe what I just seen\\, don't waste your money in this garbage","true":true}
