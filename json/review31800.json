Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So you have to give at least 1star for your review to count?  I'm done with Star Wars\\, you couldn't pay me to go to the next movie. Kathleen Kennedy has ruined the franchise and it's characters. Perhaps if they focused more on telling a good story with continuity rather pushing far left politics and bad toys Star Wars wouldn't have been destroyed. I can't believe they gave a new trilogy to the director who made the worst Star Wars movie of all time.","true":true}
