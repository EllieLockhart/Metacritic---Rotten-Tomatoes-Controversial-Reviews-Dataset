Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have enjoyed watching Star Wars since I was young but watching this movie was more painful than enjoyable. I was finding myself wondering when it would be over. Way too much poor comedy for a Star Wars movie and some very odd scenes. This whole movie was very upsetting to me. I don\u2019t recommend this movie at all for any Star Wars fan it will only upset you. Hopefully Disney will get its act together for the next movie. ","true":true}
