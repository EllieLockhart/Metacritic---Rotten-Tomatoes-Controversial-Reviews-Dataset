Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie. You can tell the director has never seen a Star Wars movie. The plot holes are countless and ruin all the other movies. Also the slapstick humor is ridiculous. It had great potential\\, but everything they set  up in Episode 7 is gone. I feel bad for JJ Abrams working on 9\\, since he has nothing to work with and most people have now lost interest. Ignoring the plot holes...The actual plot and subplot were stupid and boring too.","true":true}
