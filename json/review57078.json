Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film will age horribly.  The politics are far too current and on-the-nose\\, which practically spells disaster even in the short term.  The plot holes are gaping and utterly distracting around every turn.  The subversion for the sake of castrating adult male nerds who adore the franchise was a bold decision in the sense that it was a monumental mistake.  Classic cinema lives on as generations make way to new ones\\, which means we need our nerdy dads and moms and aunts and uncles to show us what is great.  And there's no way in hell im showing this to my son or daughter in the future.  What would i say to them?  \\\"Hey kids\\, strap in\\, this is a fun ride that teaches you about constant failure and that's life\\, constant failure\\, unless you only take lessons from your mother and female figures\\, then you'll be ok in the end\\, although most people around you won't matter at all.  Matter of fact\\, screw them\\, what does it matter anyway? We're all just a drop in the pond\\, so dont try to elevate who you are as a human being\\, because its a waste in the bigger picture.\\\" I honestly feel sorry for the parents who took their ten-year-olds to see this.  In Star Wars\\, they should be able to witness the construction of a hero\\, not the rapid deconstruction of a villain who murdered his father.  Anyway I digress... My assumption is that Johnson brought a solid foundation of ideas but was quickly swallowed up by the sudden iron fist of feminist hollywood currently dethroning and defaming any male who refuses to conform.  He is now digesting slowly in Disney's sarlacc pit of despair and i wouldn't hesitate to doubt that we will never again see an interesting film out of Rian Johnson.","true":true}
