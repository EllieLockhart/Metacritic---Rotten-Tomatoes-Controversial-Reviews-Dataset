Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I expected so much more from this film. Talk about character assassinations. I have no idea how the third movie of this trilogy will make any sense of this disaster. A slow-motion space chase and have our hero die on an island in a galaxy far\\, far\\, away from any action whatsoever. Yikes that is bad!
