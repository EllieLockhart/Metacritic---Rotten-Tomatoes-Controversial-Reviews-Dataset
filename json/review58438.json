Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Agree with Mark Hamill on this one...\\n\\\"I said to Rian\\, I said\\, \\\"Jedi's don't give up. I mean even if he had a problem he would maybe take a year to try and regroup\\, but if he made a mistake he would try and right that wrong.\\\" So right there we had a fundamental difference\\, but it's not my story anymore. It's somebody else's story\\, and Rian needed me to be a certain way to make the ending effective. That's the crux of my problem. Luke would never say that. I'm sorry. Well in this version\\, see I'm talking about the George Lucas Star Wars. This is the next generation of Star Wars\\, so I almost had to think of Luke as another character. Maybe he is Jake Skywalker.\\\"","true":true}
