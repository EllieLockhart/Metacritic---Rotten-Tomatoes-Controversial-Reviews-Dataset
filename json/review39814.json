Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a pretty movie\\, with nice cinematography; however\\, the story tries to be too against the grain and ends up being overly preachy at times\\, uneven in tone\\, and unbelievable in bad ways.  The cast is stocked with great actors who turn in solid performances\\, but they're performing a bad script.","true":true}
