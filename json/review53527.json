Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Entertaining movie\\, just like the last one\\, but I didn't wait all of this time to see the return of the beloved characters from the original trilogy just to see Disney kill them off one by one. New characters are great\\, and obviously necessary to keep a franchise going\\, but not at the expense of the last\\, and certainly not just so a one-shot director can put their mark on the franchise using cheap and convenient devices and tropes.","true":true}
