Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"lol this movie was so bad how did it get a 92% rating the script was shit from random jokes to cringy partnering hate how the killed main boss so easy i did like that part where the dumb lady takes forever to smash the massive ship with a kamikaze attack almost puked when i saw milk drinking part so cringy","true":true}
