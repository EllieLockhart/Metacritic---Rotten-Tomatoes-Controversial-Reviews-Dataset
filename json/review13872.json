{"101487":132395,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-02","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I fundamentally disagree with the \\\"critic consensus\\\" that Star Wars: \\\"The Last Jedi honors the saga's rich legacy while adding some surprising twists -- and delivering all the emotion-rich action fans could hope for.\\\"\\nRian Johnson failed to deliver on ANYTHING that TFA set up. He could have made this a truly epic movie\\, but he chose to rip up Star Wars and deliver this 'hunk of garbage'. This movie takes us nowhere and effectively ends Star Wars as we know and love. Maybe that would have worked in his new trilogy\\, but as part of the Skywalker saga\\, episode 8 fails to deliver. The supposed twists are Rian Johnson trying to be clever for clevers sake\\, but his choices lessen and shrink the galaxy. I've read so many 'fan theories' the past two years that have more depth and gravitas than what the clever Rian Johnson managed to barf up. His story telling does absolutely NO justice to not only the old\\, beloved characters\\, but also to the new characters\\, and that is an absolute travesty in itself. Poor Rose is now 'the new Jar Jar' to many people\\, and that is HORRIBLE! she is a beautiful\\, spunky actress. It's obvious that this trilogy was not thought out as a whole and they are just winging it as they go. They really dropped the ball with this one. Shame.","true":true}
