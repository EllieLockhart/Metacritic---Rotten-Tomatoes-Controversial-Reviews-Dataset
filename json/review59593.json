Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I can't say I enjoyed every minute of this game\\, but I did want to play every minute of it. I have never played a game that led me through so many contrasting emotions. There were moments I really loved and moments I truly hated.

I could list a lot more. Two days after finishing it and I\u2019m still not sure how I feel about it. The only thing I am sure of is that I've never thought about a game as much as I have thought about this one.\r\rGame play wise\\, it is solid. I played on moderate and felt it was a little more forgiving than the first game when it came to resources\\, but the areas are larger and there is a lot more to discover and explore. I had some truly wild surviving 'by the seat of your pants' spells in the game\\, expending my resources and  going hail Mary to survive which was incredibly satisfying and adrenaline filled.\r\rThe game is a lot more open that TLOU\\, there are some large expansive areas which can be explored or ignored\\, which in my eyes is something of a double edged sword. There is so much to be discovered in the optional areas\\, sweet\\, funny\\, touching\\, bleak and harrowing world building moments that really add to the game\\, but could be easily missed. If you\u2019re playing just for the main narrative\\, and head for that next 'checkpoint' at every opportunity\\, there is a huge amount to be missed.\r\rThere is no other game like this. You are forced into situations that you do not want to be in\\, you are forced to do things that you do on want to do. You do not get a choice how these characters behave\\, you are pulled through a story against your will and forced to contemplate who these characters really are. It's not a game to make you happy\\, but it is an experience like no other game will give you.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
