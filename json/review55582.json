Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"NOT A STAR WARS MOVIE!  LONG\\, BORING and UTTERLY DISAPPOINTING FROM START TO FINISH!\\nLike chocolate; a little humour is a good thing...too much makes you sick!  This film is riddled with missed opportunities\\, terrible WTF moments (including Carrie Fisher as Mary Poppins\\, poor character introductions & development and stupid force projection nonsense...to highlight only a few) and is simply awful.  It manages to take any suspense or mystery provided by previous outings (both old and new) and pour it down the toilet.  \\nSome twists are great ideas (Ray heritage) but so poor executed in such a nonchalant way.  Rian Johnson has clearly thought it would be funny to pee on the 'Luke Skywalker' story line and instead of using his end to enhance the story - let him LITERALLY fade out with a fizzle that makes no sense.  No wonder Daisy Ridley (the female lead) cried when she heard JJ Abrams was coming back for episode 9.  \\nSadly\\, that's a film I wont be paying to watch.","true":true}
