Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good Stuff-\\nAction Scenes: Fantastic fight scenes in and out of space\\nSound and CGI: Great CGI and soundtrack\\nBad Stuff-\\nActing: Stiff and wooden\\nPlot holes are everywhere\\nand finally\\, the last straw for me was the damnation of Mark Hamill's character Luke Skywalker.","true":true}
