Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While there were a LOT of things to enjoy about the film\\, and Rian Johnson does a good job packing the film with those things\\, there are a few things that could have been slightly stronger. Still a great addition into the franchise and it stands head and shoulders above Force Awakens as a new entry to the Star Wars saga.","true":true}
