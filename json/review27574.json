Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall this movie is garbage. It is total nonsense and illogical. It would have been better to put all the new characters into a new trilogy or even standalone movie and not try to put them into the skywalker trilogy. I don't have a problem with Ray or any new female characters.It is the story line and the rubbish jokes in this film\\, the storylines from FA that are binned and the amount of wasted time in the film ie the sea cows or whatever. Its good to have new characters and move on but It wasn't necessary to destroy the old characters and the old mythology to do that.  ","true":true}
