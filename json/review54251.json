Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you want old story lines to just be torn from the 70's\/80's\\, and pasted into 2017\\, then this movie won't satisfy your nostalgic needs.  The Force Awakens put us back in the Star Wars universe we wanted to be\\, and The Last Jedi has shot us into a part of that universe we have never seen. There were set ups that gave us that \\\"Oh cool\\, cookie cutter story line time\\\".  Then the cutter and cookie were sliced in half or crushed.  It has made the old school fans (those that can handle well done change) happy to see and say goodbye to old friends. Then\\, meet new ones and let them guide us through future (hopefully new) stories. More importantly\\, a whole new generation can now claim these stories as their's and not something there parents always loved.  As for that so called \\\"Mary Poppins\\\" moment\\, one can only wish Mary had been that bad ass\\,","true":true}
