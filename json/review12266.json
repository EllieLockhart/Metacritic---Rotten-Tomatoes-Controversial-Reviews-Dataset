Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am not exactly sure how Disney has killed Star Wars (which a lot of people are saying) The movie was great maybe a little slow but good. The Star Wars universe is vast and isn\u2019t all about the Skywalker\u2019s... read some of the books.. this movie was about sacrifice\\, redemption\\, and growth for multiple characters. Way better then 1\\,2\\,3 especially 2... i am excited to see what Disney does next. Also Lucas sold the rights and Disney wants to do their own thing like with Spiderman.. so everyone who hasn\u2019t seen it give it a chance and see for yourselves.. don\u2019t let these Debby downers influence you!","true":true}
