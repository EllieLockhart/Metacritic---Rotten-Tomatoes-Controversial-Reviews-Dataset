Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a great movie and is incredibly better that TFA and Rogue o\\One. if you like star wars you should definitely go see this movie now it is worth it. also most of the people are giving this movie bad reviews are racist and sexist men who do not want women or minorities to not play a lead role in star wars or any film. I would like to remind them that women and minorities have played major roles in star wars since the first film in 1977 and if you cant handle that this franchise isn't for you.","true":true}
