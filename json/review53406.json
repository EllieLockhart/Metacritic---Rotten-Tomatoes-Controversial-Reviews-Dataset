Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing  SPOILER ALERT!!! A movie that leaves you walking away wondering why they made it. There was no real story\\, except to prove that Luke screwed up and lost Ben to the dark side.. It showcased a supposed next \\\"supreme commander\\\" Kylo Ren as a spoiled\\, tantrum ridden adult sized child who has temper tantrums and no real control.   A movie that was so badly written that Fin and Rose had to have a whole subplot that was useless and gave us nothing. And when they arrived back at the \\\"base\\\" their word \\\"Is this all that is left\\\" when faced with about 30-50  people. Then there are HUNDREDS of them in the trenches - who mysteriously appear and then mysteriously disappear again\\, because everyone fits in the Millennium Falcon.  There was way too much nothing in this movie. I wasted money and my time seeing it.","true":true}
