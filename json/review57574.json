Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the worst Star Wars movie since Episode 1\\, which is saying a lot                                     especially since Episodes 2 and 3 are some of the worst movies ever made. The Prequels ruined Vader\\, at least until Rogue One resurrected him and this movie ruined Luke Skywalker. The clowns who wrote this incoherent mess and the director should never have been allowed to get their hands on these iconic characters. It's more than obvious that Mark Hammill (you know Luke himself) agrees and hates what they did to this beloved character as well. Beyond ruining one of the greatest protagonists in the history of film\\, the movie was absolute garbage. Way too much humor and reliance on special effects to cover up for lack of plot and characterization. Disney\\, just let John Nolan or Dave Filoni write the movies going forward and let Garreth Edwards direct. I won't be going to see the Solo movie\\, because it was a dumb idea in the first place and Episode 9 is now ruined. Nice Job Disney","true":true}
