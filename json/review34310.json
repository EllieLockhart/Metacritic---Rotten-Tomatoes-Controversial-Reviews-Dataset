Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The acting\\, visuals and audio were all crafted to perfection. The story\\, dialogue and direction were abominable\\, incomprehensible and unforgivable. This movie destroys all credibility within the series and removes any reason to watch the next instalment\\, other than to see if anything decent can be rescued from this trash fire. The last Jedi actually retrospectively harms the last movie\\, it was so poorly conceived. A special mention should be made about the professional critics here\\, who seem to have left their job description at the door.... were you drugged?","true":true}
