Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a disappointment!  Not only was this movie terrible\\, but it even managed to ruin some of the prior movies for me.  I actually quite liked Episode VII.  Sure\\, it was a bit of a rehash of Episode IV\\, but I really liked the new characters and there was a ton of promise at the end.  Lots of interesting ways they could have gone.  But THIS is where they went with it?!  I actually find myself disliking Episode VII now.  This one is so poorly written and poorly edited\\, with no regard whatsoever for the franchise\\, that they've probably killed it.  Just a complete hash of a movie.  I have no idea how so many critics could possibly like it.  Unless\\, I suppose\\, they just don't like Star Wars generally.  If you hate Star Wars\\, you might like this one.","true":true}
