Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Okay\\, where to begin for this movie's review.  I'll start by saying if this was a complete standalone movie\\, it was ok I guess.  The bang-bang action was wild and the characters had no depth\\, but as an box office blockbuster\\, it was ok.  As a Star Wars film along the continuum\\, it was possibly up there with Phantom Menace.  I mean\\, from the very beginning\\, it makes no sense.  This whole thing of the First Order having an endless supply of resources of men and material and the \\\"resistance\\\" having to cobble together  two sticks of firewood is tiresome.  WHY? And WHERE are all the ships and forces of the Resistance?  This movie starts basically at the very end of the last film...but you'd think the First Order Hadn't lost nearly everything in that big bang explosion.  And it goes downhill from there\\, with Hux the idiot and just continues to devolve.  Rian Johnson doesn't seem to have a clue as to Star Wars lore\\, or just doesn't care\\, as he completely butchers it.  I don't want to see him touch anything else Star Wars\\, but of course his going to arc another Trilogy\\, that I will probably be skipping.  Luke is worthless as the elder statesman\\, brooding and whining the entire film\\, Snoke is a joke\\, so he much be Hux's dad\\, as he was an even bigger joke.  Ren is I don't know what...an anarchist in some weird love connection with Rey.  Finn and his new friend are like huh?!?!  Poe is an idiot.  This movie was terrible for an arching story\\, just horrible.  The reach back to try and mirror Empire are laughable at best\\, and like I said\\, key Johnson AWAY from Star Wars.","true":true}
