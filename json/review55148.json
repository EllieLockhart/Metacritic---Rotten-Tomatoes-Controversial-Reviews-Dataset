Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was very excited to see how all of the cliffhangers from The Force Awakens would play out.  What I witnessed was nothing but disappointment. The movie was nothing but a Social Justice Warrior propaganda film.  I know many millenials loved it\\, but for those of us who watched the Star Wars franchise growing up\\, this movie looked familiar due to the ships and cinematography\\, but the story lacked movement\\, cohesion\\, and excitement.\\n\\nI don't go to the movies to be preached to\\, I go for entertainment.  This movie was not entertaining.\\n\\nI would give this a zero star rating\\, but Rotten Tomatoes does not factor into their scoring scores below 1 star.","true":true}
