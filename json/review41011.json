Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie exceeded my expectations. I'm sick of timid emotion\\, there needs to be a commonground between the stoic modern approach to cinema and the likes of episode ll and lll. This movie just about hit the spot. If episode nine follows through with the relationship between Ben Solo and Rey built up here\\, and it goes full-out\\, no fear\\, I will be pleased. The Last Jedi provides just enough twists and turns to be original and unexpected\\, but not too many that it is unrecognizable in the Star Wars world. Most complaints about the movie have to do with lack of nostalgia\\, not quality. The Last Jedi accomplishes what The Force Awakens failed to do: take new paths. And Rian Johnson chose the right ones.","true":true}
