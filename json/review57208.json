{"101487":183445,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This move is awful for so many reasons\\n\\n1. Leading men all resemble a bumbling Homer Simpson or Fry\\n    popular media wants us to believe all men are like this\\, but we aren't\\n    shame on you Hollywood \\n2. Rey looks like a ballerina\\, not a jock soccer player or softball player \\n    her fight scenes are not believable\\n    I hated the Divergent film adaptation for the same reason\\, loved Hunger Games because it got it right\\n3. Yoda and the animals are stupid looking puppets\\, not CGI\\n4. The movie ends\\, then you sit through 40 minutes of poor storytelling to clean up loose ends and prepare for the final episode\\n5. The funny parts are so campy and imitate scenes from previous episodes\\, they aren't funny\\n6. The Phasma story is never told...\\n7. Phasma dies a super lame death after a super lame fight scene. Are you kidding me???  \\n   * Phasma rose to become a general in the First Order\\, \\n     she actually looks like a tough beast competitor and she falls to two bumbling idiots with no story ever telling us how she crawled to such great heights\\n8. Finn's story doesn't make sense unless he's schizophrenic\\n    He's really still fighting an inner battle lacking grit and fortitude after the last episode? \\n    Does he care enough for Rey to go looking for her or does he really want to bail on the rebellion? You can't have it both ways and the depiction in this episode does not resemble confusion\\, it plays much more like schizophrenia and we lose compassion for him instead. I did.\\n9. Luke abandoned the Force - are you kidding me? Once again\\, you reduce a leading male to bumbling fool lacking self-confidence after a lifetime of hardship?\\n    again the storyteller wants us to believe a storyline whose foundation is complete horse crap and set up terribly. You really want us to believe it is Rey's actions and Yoda appearing which restore his confidence? This was completely bungled in the portrayal. Dumb and illogically played out.\\n\\n\\nI have loved Star Wars since I first saw episode 4 from the back of the family van in a run-down drive-in way back in 1977. This film is a betrayal of trust and worries too much about being politically correct. \\n\\nGo shoot this one over with a different director.","true":true}
