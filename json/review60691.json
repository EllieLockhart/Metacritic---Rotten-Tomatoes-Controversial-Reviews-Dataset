Even if you don't necessarily like the story\\, the gameplay and technology on display here is insane. I played through very stealthy on the default difficulty the first time and it was fun but standard stealth action fare; it was when I let loose on a custom difficulty and just faced the music head on that the game really shined for me. You will see bits of gameplay that you'd swear were a cutscene. It's mesmerizing. It's a very violent good time.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
