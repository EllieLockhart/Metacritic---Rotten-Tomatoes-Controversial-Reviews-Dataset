I never played the first game till it came out as a remaster. So perhaps my standards are higher than most fans of the series. But the jump in visuals and game play seem very minor for a new AAA game.

I never played the first game till it came out as a remaster. So perhaps my standards are higher than most fans of the series. But the jump in visuals and game play seem very minor for a new AAA game. That alone was what earned the 2 pity points.\r\rEvery thing else about this game was pretty much a disappointment. How Sony and Naughtdog handled themselves leading up to it's release\\, the false promises and misleading trailers left a pretty sour taste in your mouth once you sit down and start playing the game. It was no surprise that I managed to get this game used about 24 hours after it's release\\, mostly so I wouldn't support the company with my purchase.\r\rThe story is bleak\\, depressing and pretty much the core of the game. No one plays a single player story driven game to hate the story. So while the graphics\\, music\\, game play are some what average the main focus drives the score down imo. I thought about giving it a zero just to off set all the all the fake positive reviews but in the end decided it would be unfair.\r\rOne of the features I found the most annoying is the complete by the rails story telling your forced into. This is a super linear game with pretty much no player choices that affect anything. Given the almost open world nature of the game and long slogs between story elements this seemed odd to me. It's like it wanted to be a Bethesda game\\, but couldn't be bothered to have branching story options or multiple endings.\r\rIn the end this game is a mediocre game at best with a beyond disappointing pay off and story. If you love watching people and animals be tortured\\, mutilated and killed for 25+ hours this is the game for you. Otherwise give it a pass and watch the news  for a few hours and you'll be just as depressed.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
