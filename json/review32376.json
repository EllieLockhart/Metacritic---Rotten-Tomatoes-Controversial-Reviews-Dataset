Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star wars is dead disney killed it the rotten tomatoes score is a pack of lies by paid disney shills to afraid of the mouse to speak the truth cause disney owns half of Hollywood.The last jedi is The final nail in the star wars coffin my favorite franchise Has been raped by mickey mouse and screw kathleen Kennedy and rian Johnson. I bet George lucas is laughing his rich arse off at all the prequel hating twats who bullied him.Rest in peace star wars.","true":true}
