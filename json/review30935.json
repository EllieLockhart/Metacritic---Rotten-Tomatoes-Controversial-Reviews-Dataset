Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointed in this movie slow boring storyline Luke seems like a different character to the one we know and have waited so long to see again\\, at times he seemed almost cowardly and selfish. Who is Snook and why is he so scarred. Why did Yoda return as a ghost but not obi wan? So many unanswered questions. #thumbsdown","true":true}
