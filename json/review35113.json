Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The force awakens did a decent job of setting things up and creating excitement for the next installments.. this was a complete disaster and paid nothing off.. congratulations you subverted my expectations of viewing a good movie well done","true":true}
