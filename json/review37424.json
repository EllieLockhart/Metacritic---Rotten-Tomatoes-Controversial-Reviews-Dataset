Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are a lot of aspects of The Last Jedi I don't think general audiences will like. But general audiences also fueled five Michael Bay Transformers movies. The Last Jedi will challenge you. This is a beautiful film\\, moved me to tears. The Last Jedi proves you can honor a series and it's legacy\\, while still blazing new story-telling ground.","true":true}
