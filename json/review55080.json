{"101487":146185,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-04","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I walked into the theater with an open mind\\, no biases\\, and no theories needing to be fulfilled. I left disappointed\\, unfulfilled\\, and empty. I wanted so bad to like this movie. I really did. Over an hour into it\\, I almost prayed that something\\, or someone would change the course of where this movie was headed\\, but it simply didn't happen. Star Wars these days is like an aging famous rock band\\, with its devout followers\\, who are obsessed with its merchandise\\, arguing pointlessly over whose theories have more substantiality\\, and whether Disney should be allowed to guide the franchise as it races (or limps) forward. I am\\, and always will be a Start Wars fan. I am not obsessed with Star Wars\\, nor do I feel the need to bash Rian Johnson or petition to have The Last Jedi removed from the Start Wars movie canon. \\nMy conscious will not\\, however\\, prevent me from telling the truth- this is the worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen. Star Wars is supposed to be fun\\, emotionally gripping\\, and give you hope\\, even when hope itself seems to have died. Instead\\, what I saw was a movie that tried to lecture me\\, insult my intelligence\\, and get me to laugh at jokes meant for a Monty Python picture. Worst of all\\, just as some aging rock bands have made the mistake of accomplishing\\, The Last Jedi not only isolates the Star Wars fan base for the worst possible reasons\\, it goes one step further and divides them. This move will obviously never affect Disney's checkbook\\, but it proves that quality has become overlooked in favor of what the Star Wars name itself is worth. \\nDare I say\\, somewhere\\, most likely in the California Bay Area\\, George Lucas is feeling vindicated.","true":true}
