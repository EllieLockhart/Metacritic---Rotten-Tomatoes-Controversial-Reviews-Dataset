Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was absolutely the worst ever made. Absolutely threw away all of the original goodness and made it a movie for kids and to make money. It might be better than a half star movie vs all movies but within the Star Wars franchise this is a more than fair rating. Save your money and wait for it to be free on tv....in like a week. Disney should put out an apology for making it and put it on free tv so everyone knows what a mistake is. ","true":true}
