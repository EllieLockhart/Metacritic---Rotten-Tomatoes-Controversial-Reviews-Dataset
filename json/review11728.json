Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How could anybody at Disney think this would go well? We'll just ruin the Luke Skywalker character and kill him off\\, fail to utilize one of the best villains to come along in quite sometime in Snoke\\, make up ridiculous new force powers with no context or development\\, fail to develop any new understanding of the force or the Jedi at the original Jedi temple\\, fail to put any thought or development into Rey's lineage\\, and make the entire movie about the most ridiculous slow-speed chase in movie history. They'll love it. Well played Disney. Well played.","true":true}
