Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT DISNEY PAID OFF THIS SHILL\\, HACK ROTTENTOMATOES CRITICS. The art of Film criticism has been replaced by illiterate\\, movie junkies. The Last Jedi is a travesty to the cannon and legacy of star wars and an example of what a billion dollar corporation like disney will do with something like star wars -  they look at the \\\"financial bottom line and treat it like a stock on the stock exchange.\\\" No true star wars fan will truly like this move\\, its for a target demographic of marvel superhero fans\\, and millenials that binge watch shite like Dexter etc. This movie is mediocre at best and has changed the next 50 years of what we have to loo forward to of star wars\\, forever\\, all in the name of one thing...the bottom line which is dollar bills.","true":true}
