Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was so incredibly disappointed in this movie. I love Star Wars\\, I consider myself a huge fan. With that said\\, to be frank I am absolutely furious with Lucas Films for producing this movie. This film has destroyed continuity in Star Wars. I understand that plenty of people are trying to point out how this film VERY subtly sets up episode 9 in which we will learn everything we have wanted to know since episode 7. This is entirely my opinion\\, but the Last Jedi developed so little that episode 9 is tragically doomed. episode 9 will have to be 5 hours long in order to develop and explain everything we want to know; why Rey is so powerful\\, everything Snoke\\, what's up with Po and Leia\\, where is the rest of the Universe while there are new Death Stars and Dreadnaughts are being built\\, etc.? I dont even care if anyone reads this. I've seen this movie twice and read loads of reviews and such. Nothing can convince me that this was one of the biggest series bombs in film history. in summation The Last Jedi is the most frustrating movies that I have ever seen.","true":true}
