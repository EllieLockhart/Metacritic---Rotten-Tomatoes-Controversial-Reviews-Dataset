Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pros: - Solid acting all around\\, especially by Mark Hamill\\, Adam Driver\\, and Donhnall Gleason. - Very interesting dynamic between Rey and Kylo Ren - Beautiful cinematography Cons: - Sloppy script and dialogue - Too much teasing and not enough payoff many times. What did the Jedi do wrong? Who is Rey? Who is Snoke? NO new information regarding Star Wars lore. - Zero reason to have Finn\\, Rose\\, DJ\\, or any of the Canto Bite scenes at all. Forced in a pointless plot line just to have a confrontation between Phasma and Finn. ","true":true}
