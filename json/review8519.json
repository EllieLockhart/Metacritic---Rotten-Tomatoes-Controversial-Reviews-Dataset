Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First 2 times i saw this\\, i felt enjoyment in all the flashy cool things.. but after that 3rd time i tried to focus to story and flow of the film\\, how its written\\, how this works as a movie... it doesnt. its almost unwatchable because of plot holes and nonsensical cuts and story\\, nothing is taken seriously\\, Rey can do everything without effort\\, perfection with everything she does... no faults\\, no passions\\, no character... all male characters are just jokes\\, Hux is slapstick general\\, Kylo Ren is back to emokid\\, Luke is a hermit\\, that im ok with\\, but give us something to understand why\\, something more than just few seconds of... whops didnt mean to do that... Noooo... \\n\\nwhole thing is starting to feel like a huge Trollfest....","true":true}
