Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie to date. Absolutely awful. I am a huge Star Wars fan and Disney ruined it with this one. The humor was trash and the whole feel of the movie was just bad. There was no sense of immersion to the universe.","true":true}
