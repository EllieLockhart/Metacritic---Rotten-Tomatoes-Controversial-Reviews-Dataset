Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I created a Rotten Tomatoes account just to say that I wish I had never seen this movie. It's one of those movies where the creators felt a need to be \\\"original\\\" but didn't actually have the talent to match their ego\\, so they decided to be ironic instead. They ended up making a movie that's original in the same way a painter who doesn't know how to draw must create something deliberately bad so they can't be accused of trying to make something good.\\n\\nThe whole movie is a sequence of storytelling gimmicks that are meant to surprise you without actually telling a story. None of the story lines lead anywhere\\, and none of the characters learn or do anything meaningful. In the process of shot-gunning gratuitous plot twists to keep you from following asleep\\, the creators pretty much made a joke of Star Wars. It's just another Transformers franchise now. Even the Harry Potter sequels knew when to let things end.","true":true}
