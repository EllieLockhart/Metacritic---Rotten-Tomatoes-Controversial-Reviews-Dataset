Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Filled with plot holes\\, didn't explain anything we didn't already know\\, had way too much comedy and was a very bad plot. I'd say the prequils are 100% better then this. I hope all you \\\"critics\\\" are viewing this\\, stop looking at this movie as a Broadway show with deeper meaning\\, or a show with flashy cgi. Start watching it as an actual sit down with your friends\\, grab your popcorn movie. Let's be honest Disney didn't just kill the horse with this\\, they chopped it up\\, threw it in the burger mix and expect us to keep eating.","true":true}
