Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie critics need to rethink their impression of this movie in that it deviates from the original formula of the George Lucas saga.  Credit should be given to the fans who voted it in the 40s%.  The critics may rate it high\\, but in the end the fans bring in the profit and ultimate support.","true":true}
