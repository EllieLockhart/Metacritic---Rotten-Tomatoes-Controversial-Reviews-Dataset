Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a Big Stars wars since it started in 1977...I'm disappointed in this movie\\,it is as said to be the best ever..It's not..not enough action \\,battles \\,light saber duels and Snokes dies early..what's that all about??? The Emperor lived longer than Snokes..if 9 isn't any better..I will stop seeing anymore after this..and stick to the originals\u200b...","true":true}
