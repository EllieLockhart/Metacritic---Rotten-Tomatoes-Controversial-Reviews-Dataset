Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Say what you will about the last Jedi\\, but I enjoyed some of the parts of the film\\, it was average. The Last Jedi is not like Ghostbusters where the audience gets too much pandering towards the tough female crowd. If George Lucas secretly write this film with Rian Johnson I can really agree with everyone. The cast from the last film is good with Rey\\, Finn\\, and Poe these people are the next generation of the sequel trilogy. The cinematography is fantastic and so does the music by John Williams does a great job if it weren't for John this film would've sucked really hard\\, the music is the heart of the film. \\nThe bad guys are alright no one wants Snoke aka Paplatine knock off to be involved anymore\\, although Andy Serkis performance sells it. Adam Driver (Kylo Ren) really tries in this film after seeing him from the force awakens and Lucky Logan he can really nail performances like Kylo Haden Christensen feels so cliche and does not hold up. It was really nice to see Mark Hamill again and so does Carrie Fisher after what the prequels dragged and at least were not the main characters of the sequel trilogy this time\\, not since what happens to Kingdom of the Crystal Meth. Here are the problems of the movie the casino scene of course everyone talks about. Rose Tico and the rest of the cast including Laura Dern and Benicio Del Toro get's no introduction. Rian is an inexperienced director by making two films Bricks and Looper then did episodes of Breaking Bad in which gains cult status. ","true":true}
