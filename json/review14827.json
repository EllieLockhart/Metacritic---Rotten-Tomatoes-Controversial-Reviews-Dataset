Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have watched all the Star Wars movies up to now. I have the first six (in order of production) on DVD and\/or Blu Ray at home and enjoy watching them. The last few have been lame but I kept the faith and went to see them anyways. They suck now ... Hollywood has infected the best movie franchise of all time and their bought\/paid-for critics give it praise like predictable lap-dogs. And Disney? please stick with cartoons and keep the PC crap out of them. Let kids be kids at least for a while.","true":true}
