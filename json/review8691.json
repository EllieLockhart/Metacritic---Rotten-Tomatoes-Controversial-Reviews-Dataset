Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Flat out loved it; easily one of the best Star Wars movies. I have to knit pick as I'm not a fan of What they do with Luke at the end of the movie.","true":true}
