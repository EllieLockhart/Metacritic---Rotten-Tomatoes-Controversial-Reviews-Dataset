Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great movie! Went against the grain for what anyone expected\\, but done brilliantly. You have to think about the original films and what happened to understand Luke's direction in the film. I wish it followed SW EU\\, but disney is cherry picking. I wish Finn had a bigger part\\, but that's it.","true":true}
