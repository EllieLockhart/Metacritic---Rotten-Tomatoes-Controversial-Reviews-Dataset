Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"And this is where it all went down hill for SW. This movie is absolute garbage\\, More unanswered questions and most from TFA aren't answered. Plot holes. plot holes and more plot holes. Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy both helped destroy the franchise with TLJ. It's not funny no matter how hard it tries (sorry Rian but leave the comedy to others). it's more cliche then TFA and that was not good either. It rips off both The Empire Strikes Back and Return of The Jedi. It destroys the lore of the SW universe and kills Luke Skywalker before he's on screen. The luke you saw in the movie is not Luke. That's the Luke that Rian Johnson wanted to see when he was a kid watching the originals. Rian Johnson is that weird guy at the party. When a group of people are talking about what would happen next in star wars\\, Rian Johnson was that guy everyone looked at and said \\\"WTF are you talking about\\, go away.\\\" Critics want to have you believe that this is the best SW movie ever made. It's not. How is ripping off episode 5 and 6 fresh. I honestly wish that episode 7 and 8 were never made. Back to the drawing bored everyone.","true":true}
