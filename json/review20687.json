Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've watched this twice. If you're looking for a continued feel of the original trilogy\\, the Last Jedi has no soul. It is so bad that you may not want to ever watch another movie again let alone a Star Wars movie. But\\, why just redo the past? Just watch the original movies. \\nIf you are looking for an evolution of the theme you will probably see The Last Jedi as the best of the series. If there are any plots holes\\, there are very few and they are minor. It's pretty clear that many things will be revealed in the next installment. It all centers on getting rid of our obsession with the cult of personality. You will soon see what Kathleen\\, Rian and their team have done.\\nI love the original trilogy and I love this new vision. Well done and thank you. \\nps. I doubt that there is a conspiracy for low ratings. Rotten Tomatoes is not a random sampling. If 60\\,000 people give the movie 0 stars\\, isn't that something like 0.1% of those who watched it? Isn't it possible that there are that many fans who are outraged because they wanted something else? Nothing wrong with that but this movie isn't that.","true":true}
