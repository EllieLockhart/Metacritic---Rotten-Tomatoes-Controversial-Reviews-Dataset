Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not Star Wars anymore. Is only a \\\"tribute film\\\" made to win money because it says \\\"Star Wars\\\" on the titles... The new \\\"story\\\" is pure garbage with no creativity and plot holes everywhere. It have no sense.\\nStar Wars is not a movie that you need to see it twice so you can understan it.\\nThe only good thing is that John Williams is behind the music and you can feel that Star Wars essence that also was missing on Episode VII. BUT THATS ALL!!! Its like a slap on the face to Star Wars fans...\\nThe scene of Luke throwing the lightsaber over his shoulder feels like the way Disney sees the complete saga and George Lucas's story.\\n\\nThey can do a lot of spin-off movies using ideas taken from the expand univers like \\\"SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE\\\" and with that build a great story like they do with \\\"ROGUE ONE\\\". But no by taking the story of six movies and throwing it to the garbage traying to do \\\"something new\\\" for the new generations...\\n\\nFor me and a lot of people to; Episode VII and VIII never existed.","true":true}
