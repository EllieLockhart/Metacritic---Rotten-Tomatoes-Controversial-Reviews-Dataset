Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No Star Wars feeling or atmosphere. Too fast\\, too many groups of characters and I don't seem to care about most of them. I used to care about Fin and the pilot Pow in the previous movie.\\nAt least Kylo Ren improved.\\nEpisode VII was better\\, not mention the original trilogy.","true":true}
