Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic addition to the canon. This is a great movie that redeems the series and pulls it out of the doldrums it has been in since Return of the Jedi. The fact that pathetic DJT fanboys are freaking out about its positive messages is just icing on the cake.","true":true}
