Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only interesting characters in the entire movie were Rey and Kylo. Finn and his story arc was unnecessary. Leia flying in space is the dumbest thing I have ever seen. We waited all these years to see Luke fight as a hologram?????? SERIOUSLY!? Terrible","true":true}
