Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"if i could give this 0 stars i would. if this wasn't star wars\\, it would still be a BAD film. weak plot and story lines that go nowhere. our favorite characters reduced to the least amount of screen time. \\nand they REBOOTED mid trilogy. very confusing.","true":true}
