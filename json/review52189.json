Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After watching it and being caught up in the nostalgia of all the trailers and talk I had such high hopes....\\nBut the story just wasn't well thought out little or nothing was build upon the positives aspects of the last film. \\nGeorge Lucas had it write when he said it was beautifully made but Rian Johnson is responsible for the lack of imagination that went into the story.. \\ndisappointed!!!","true":true}
