The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Best game ever. No other movie\\, game\\, book\\, etc. has ever made me feel like this game. If you are turned off by the game's twists and turns\\, notably playing as Abby\\, then I'm unsure you even played the full game. This game is a masterpiece. The violence and loss of life is remarkably captured that allows for the player to reflect on the characters\\, what they meant to you\\, and how they are presented in TLoU universe. Someone's hero is someone else's villain\\, and this game captures this perfectly. Revenge drives the game's plot\\, and the swap over the Abby may have originally seen out of place. When Abby killed Joel I was so ready to travel across the face of the earth\\, to do anything\\, to kill anyone in order to avenge Joel. When you are forced to fight Ellie as Abby it felt so wrong\\, but that's the beauty of the game. It takes you to a place that is so uniquely uncomfortable. YOU get to view both sides of the plot. This game is not like other stories\\, so don't try to view it as something as simple as a revenge plot soured by playing as \\\"the bad guy.\\\" There is no \\\"bad guy\\,\\\" or rather\\, every \\\"good guy\\\" can be someone else's \\\"bad guy.\\\" This game is so hard to play at times because of how immensely powerful it is. You have to be very open minded to enjoy it and not leap to hate it as soon as a dramatic change is the story-line occurs. Ellie will always be my favorite but I was able to grow to also love Abby. I think the game makes this transition quite beautifully\\, and I beg you not be so critical of it. Crowd think is very powerful and I think the hate towards the game is mainly due to Joel's \\\"premature\\\" death\\, along with Abby's character build being so controversial that it manifested into a witch hunt\\, in other words\\, a scouring of the game's plot to find every potentially controversial aspect to serve those who are unhappy about Joel or Abby's confirmation bias. It's a truly magnificent game\\, and if you haven't played it on your own\\, please do. Go in with an empty mind (after playing the first game) and expect a great sequel to one of our generation's finest games\\, and you won't be disappointed. Actually\\, I think you will be blown away by how powerful it is.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
