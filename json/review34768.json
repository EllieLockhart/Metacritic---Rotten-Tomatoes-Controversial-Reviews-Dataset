Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the direction taken by director rian johnson and his team in my opinion is the direction needed by the  beloved franchise in this modern world of entertainment  in my opinion. i find this movie enjoyable and interesting  as it takes a different  direction from previous star wars movies","true":true}
