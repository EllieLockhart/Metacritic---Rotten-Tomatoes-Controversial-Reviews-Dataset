Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a bait and switch.\\n\\nSubversion: \\\"the tendency or intention to subvert or overthrow\\, destroy\\, or undermine an established or existing system or a set of beliefs.\\\"\\n\\nBait and switch: \\\"the ploy of offering a person something desirable to gain favor\\, and then thwarting expectations with something less desirable.\\\"\\n\\nSubverting expectations\\, Rian?
