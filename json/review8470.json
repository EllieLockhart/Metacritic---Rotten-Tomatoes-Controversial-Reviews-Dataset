Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Finally got around to seeing this and..... what an awful movie! I see why the fans are so hateful of the director\\, it's like he went out of his way to shove two finger up to the original movies. If you want strong female characters\\, make them good ones\\, and believable ones\\, like say the lead in Rouge One\\, or Ripley in Aliens.... don't just throw in random characters with no weight or point and expect them to work because they represent a minority. Who would've thought Luke Skywalker would turn out to be a miserable old coward? It's clear that Rian Johnson didn't have a clue how to go forward with this story. I don't think I'll be seeing the new one this christmas\\, there's no way forward from here\\, other than a reboot.","true":true}
