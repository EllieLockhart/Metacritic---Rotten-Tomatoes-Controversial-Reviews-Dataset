Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My sincere condolences to everyone who hated it. \\n\\nI am a long-time fan and I LOVED the film. It was great to see something new and not just a reboot of IV (yes I'm talking to you JJ). \\n\\nThe thousands of fan theories during the past 2 years had a negative impact on many people's experience of the EVIII. I don't think any other entry has devided the SW community as much as EVIII and I guess for the majority of us it will be either a hit or a miss. \\n\\nMay the force be with us.","true":true}
