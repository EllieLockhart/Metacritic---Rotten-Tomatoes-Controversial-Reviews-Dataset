Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Garbage!!!\\n\\nI still remember watching Empire Strikes Back at drive-in theater in 1980 as a wee lad... most of my life this Saga has to me\\, and so many others\\, been a very defining part of our generation and a hero \\\"Luke Skywalker\\\" who every kid wanted to emulate........ Now\\, regrettably\\, in one single movie\\, it has been swept away and the entire thing is ruined. I'm not the only one who feels this way. A many number of Star wars fans will be alienated by this and not bother to see ep IX. \\n\\n- For what it's worth though\\, the visual spectacle of this film is amazing. Well done to the production team in that aspect. Every single frame\/ screen shot was amazing. Lighting\\, colours\\, effects blending...the lot\\, just brilliant. I only wish the writing and plot had employed even a fraction of your efforts and this movie may have had a chance with fans.","true":true}
