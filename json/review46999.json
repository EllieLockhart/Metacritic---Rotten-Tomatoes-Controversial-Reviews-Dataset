Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a disappointing installment to the Star Wars saga. While the pacing\\, scene cutting\\, unnecessary characters and story arcs\\, and questionable plot decisions alone would make this a disappointment\\, the worst part by far was the Disney mainstay to inundate every scene with cheap\\, crowd-pleasing humor. Not a single moment goes by without an out-of-place joke. Every time a scene draws you in and connects with you\\, it kicks you back into reality with some halfhearted attempt at humor.\\nThis isn't a \\\"well\\, Empire was poorly reviewed at first\\\" kind of movie. It's just bad.","true":true}
