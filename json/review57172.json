Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is  such a bad movie: poor script and most of the acting was underwhelming\\, the message some lines presented to us  were idiotic  (\\\"kill the past\\\" \\\"just obey\\\")\\, and pictures with burning books   (especially for a germanl like me)  evoke really bad moments from history without giving them a sattisfying meaning for our present time if not for Star Wars. There was on the whole no redeemng quality\\, I would never  like to see this garbage again. I  really do not know what the so called critics have learned or studied\\, maybe they have just  a bad taste. Disney\\, I would recommand You to sell the franchise to somebody with a better managemand and sufficient artistic skills.  \\nOn hte other hand\\, Maybe its is simply  true that Hollywood in generell does not know any more how to entertain nomal people. Well\\, obviouly we cannot write Symphonie like Mozart any more or skapespearean Sonnetts. Maybe the time is just over. \\n\\nOne wish I do have: let the old characters\\, out heroes\\,  alone\\, put Your hands off from polititic propaganda\\, because some \\\"characters\\\" in \\\"Last Jedi\\\" were pure feminist or -  philisophically speaking - even worse nihilistic propaganda.","true":true}
