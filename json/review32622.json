Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\u2018Star Wars: The Last Jedi\u2019 is another epic and satisfying entry in the Skywalker saga where director Rian Johnson touches all the nostalgic bases\\, and then wipes them all in the past to push the story forward in new ways\\, all the while reminding the fans that Star Wars is allowed to be funny too\\, and Mark Hamill deserves more credit.","true":true}
