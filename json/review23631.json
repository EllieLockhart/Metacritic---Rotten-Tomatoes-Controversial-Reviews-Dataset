Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Love Star Wars. Parts of The Last Jedi are Epic Star Wars. A scene calls up back to Return of the Jedi. New force abilities are explored. New characters do things that are astonishing. One scene is directly out of my dreams as a child. All that being said\\, movie suffers in pacing\\, story\\, and how it handles lore. Humor at times just doesn't work. Overall a good time at the movies\\, but should have been about 30 min shorter. ","true":true}
