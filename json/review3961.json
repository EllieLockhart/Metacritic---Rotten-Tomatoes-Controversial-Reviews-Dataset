Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Boring garbage\\, it's so fragmented and filled with feministic-pussy-odder that it disturbs the force itself (White Men vs. Woman). \\n\\nWhere the fuck are the female villains in this movie?\\n\\nJust leave fucking political statement at the door \\\"Disney\\\". Star Wars shouldn't be infested with any ideology it's should be for everyone. Yet they paint the Empire as the White Male side trying to supress the Female feminist agenda.\\n\\nYou can clearly see this with Holdo character\\, pure personification of that political view that Disney is trying to force across its audience to stay politically relevant\\, a character forced into place just to get that feminine view across and put everyone in their place. \\n\\nFunny enough\\, majority of female viewers don't like Holdo\\, it just too forced.\\n\\nThis is\\, Star Wars Lego - The Last Jedi on the big screen. The story is so bad in The Last Jedi\\, it tears apart the very fabric of the Star Wars lore. The pacing is so off and lifeless\\, it literally bleeds your curiosity dry.\\n\\nAs a matter of fact\\, Disney manages to take established-franchise characters\\, which are beloved by millions around the world\\, and successfully extinguish their significance.\\n\\nLegendary characters deserve\\, epic conclusions to their story lines. These characters are the bread and butter of your franchise\\, by delivering unsatisfying-below-average endings you are not giving the decades old characters a deserving closure proportionate to their stature\\, a prestige that has been built up thru the ages by fans.\\n\\nEvery heard of the expression\\, \\\"To die a heroes death\\\" Disney has disrespected a large majority of its viewing base by having Luke\\, try to send a projection of himself across the galaxy\\, which leads to a heart attack while meditating on a rock. It's stupid\\, shameful and disgraceful ending to a hero. \\n\\nWOMEN \\n\\nLeia- Strong Leader \\nPurple Haired Chick- Strong Leader who becomes a martyr. \\nAsian Chick- Strong Leader\\, tazes Finn for being a coward and makes him ride backseat in escape scene \\nAsian Chick's Sister- ONLY bomber alive\\, broken back and sacrifices herself for the cause. \\nRey- Jesus Christ of Star Wars Finn's Commander- Strong Leader \\n\\nMEN \\nFinn- Fucking\\, spineless-traitor clown \\nPoe- Bloodthirsty 'flyboy' \\nLuke- Almost kills a child (Kylo Ren) due to a 'moment of weakness'\\, Rey's bitch\\, killed by a heart attack \\nKylo Ren- Whiny little bitch with anger management issues DJ- Dirty thief who backstabs The Resistance to make a profit \\nSnoke- An evil weird old man whose existence is pointless.","true":true}
