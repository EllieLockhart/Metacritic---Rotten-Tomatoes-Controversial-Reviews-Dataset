Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst star wars movie ever made. I will never give Disney a penny again. This movie is like the genocide of a culture. Poor writing\\, no character build\\, terrible comedic timing\\, otter disrespect for every writer character and storyline that came before it\\, if you love The Story of humanity that is captured in the original trilogy of Star Wars that shows us who we are and how it takes hard work and dedication to become better then you're looking at the wrong movie this is not that movie. This movie was made buy a bunch of bigots that are pushing a political agenda at the expense of all storyline completely. If you decide to watch this movie all I can say is I'm sorry and May the force be with you cuz it's not in this movie.","true":true}
