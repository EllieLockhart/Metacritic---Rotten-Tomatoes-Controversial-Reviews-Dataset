Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson made terrible choice after terrible choice. Every decision seemed lazy on a directorial standpoint and the writing made me care so little about every character. The characters I came to love from JJ Abram's ep. 7 were horribly underutilized in this movie and there was too much of a focus on Johnson's new characters that were introduced for this movie\\, which all were weak. How Johnson could let Del Toro play the same character he played in Snatched when they aren't in the same movie universe is mind boggling. This movie was a jumbled mess and I hope he is not given another Star Wars movie let alone a whole trilogy. He single handedly took all my excitement away for this trilogy and made so I don't care at all about ep. 9. If Abrams can salvage the conclusion of this trilogy he will be the greatest director of all time. ","true":true}
