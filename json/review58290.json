Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely horrible. What they did to Luke was an abomination. Kathleen Kennedy should be fired from Lucasfilm immediately. Rian Johnson you ruined Luke. \\n\\nI didn't wait 30 years to see Luke become this crap. Mark Hamill you are still amazing and clearly you knew Rian was clueless... as did Daisy.\\n\\nThis is the worst Star Wars movie ever. ATOC sucked but at least it felt like a SW movie.\\n\\nI am one of the biggest SW fans you'd ever meet with a massive collection and my son is named after Luke. This a cruel joke. Terrible plot\\, no payoffs and worst of all... I don't care if what happens next. I don't care about 9 or \\,johnsons trilogy. Anyone who knows me would be shocked. \\n\\nThis isn't going to go the way I think all right. Because I was thinking it was going to be a great movie","true":true}
