Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think that the movie could have been a little shorter. Some scenes\\, like the casino one\\, and some of the action scenes could have been cut out. But overall is an entertaining movie\\, and a good continuation to the Star Wars saga.","true":true}
