Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It made me hate Star Wars. I didn't think that was even possible but it did. \\n\\nCountless plot points that don't make a lick of sense\\, all the men are portrayed negatively but not the women\\, older non-female characters are treated in a dismissive manner with Admiral Ackbar being disrespectfully killed off screen and I was forced to watch Luke Skywalker jerk off a a giant alien-cow-elephant and drink it's excretions.\\n\\nI still love the old movies but everything under the Disney name is now just sjw tripe to me. As far as I'm concerned\\, Star Wars ended when Ahsoka walked off into the sunset with both middle fingers raised backwards.","true":true}
