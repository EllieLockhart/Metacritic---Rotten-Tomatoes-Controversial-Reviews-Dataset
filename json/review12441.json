Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can live with the plot holes\\, even though they are many. I can live with the bad jokes that start at the very beginning. I can live with rey parenthood (that i kinda like)\\, or Snoke lame death. What kills it to me is that I can't buy Kylo \\\"bad guy\\\" acts. He barely suffered in life\\, there is no reason for the conflict. Make him a bad guy altogether\\, a psychopath. But don't try to sell me conflict and love story where there is nothing to back that up. \\n\\nStilllll\\, its star wars and like it. But the worst star wars ever.","true":true}
