Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Insulting. An utterly wasted effort\\, but moreover\\, just shockingly awful script structure\\, dialogue\\, continuity... common sense\\, for any film\\, not just Star Wars. Completely tone deaf to the world and its history. Maybe these are a reflection of the times\\, but it seems purposeful\\, like a calculated and conscious attempt was made to slap the audience down\\, to remind them that what they love\\, whether it's Star Wars or just going to the movies in general\\, that they are of such little regard ($$$) any flaming  bag of shit will do. Idiot class\\, know your place... I bet you won't ever forget now. What are you gonna do about it?","true":true}
