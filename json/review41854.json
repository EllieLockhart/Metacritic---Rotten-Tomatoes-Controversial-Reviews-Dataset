Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is terrible.  I will not spend another nickel on a Disney produced Star Wars movie.  I've never been as disappointed in a franchise as I have been with Star Wars as of late\\, I'm done.","true":true}
