Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not a huge fan of the prequels. This is still my least favorite Star Wars movie. I could not stand the gambling planet\\, low speed space chase\\, Rays parents. They blamed the low audience rating on trolls\\, but I don't know a single person IRL that liked this movie. Making the movie surprising bad is not a twist.","true":true}
