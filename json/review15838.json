Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love Star Wars.. I loved every movie from part 1-6. \\nStar wars episode 7 was ok\\, it wasnt what i learned to love over all these years\\, but i hoped\\, they would get back on track with this one... oh boy was i wrong!!\\nRey is a \\\"mary sue\\\".. as much as i want to like this film and rey\\, you cant deny that she is \\\"perfect\\\".. she is stronger then kylo ren with no training at all... and the people who saidshe only beat him in the 7nd part because he was already hurt. Now when they both fought against Snokes guards\\, it was rey wh needed to help kylo ren\\, because he would have gotten killed by them.. but luckily the girl is so strong to beat them herself and help kylo with his opponents.. and the best part is\\, she trained about 2 hours to get this strong. I know that there was a feminist involved in all that happened\\, which explains a lot... i loved the idea of a female lead etc. but not if the most beloved luke skywalker and everyone else is made looking bad\\, just so she can show that a women is stronger then anyone else...\\n\\nI could writte a novell what i didnt like or liked about the movie\\, so im just going to point out some pro and cons.\\n\\nPro:\\n- Its star wars\\, star wars is always awesome\\n- Kylo Ren!! He unlike rey is believebale \\\"Human\\\" not overpowered and relatable\\n- Special effects \/ visuals\\n- Cool planets etc.\\n- Death of Snoke! Once again the student kills his master\\n\\nCon:\\n- Rey \\\"mary sue\\\"\\n- Luke!!! They destroyed his character completly\\n- Too many love stories...This is star wars not the notebook darn it :p\\n- Lea is Superman in Space\\n- Not enough lightsaber action...\\n- Too cringy it times ( i know its supposed to appeal to kids etc. but at certain points its a bit too much)\\n- Way too much comedy... again this is star wars not the big bang theorie\\n\\n\\nNeutral:\\n- Forced racial diversity ( I like finn etc. but i cant help to feel\\, as they wanted to get in everything\\, which felt forced but allright\\, still cool :)!\\n\\nSorry for my bad english\\, i rushed a bit while writting this.. just had to get some of my thoughts out there","true":true}
