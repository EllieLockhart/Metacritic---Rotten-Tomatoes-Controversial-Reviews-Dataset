Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie left more questions than answers. Who is snoke by the way he's dead . Rey's parents or background. Captain phasma who she never in the movie . By the way she's dead . Then Luke sky walker we all I think wanted something epic too happen with him never got it and he's dead. The comedy works in the marvel movies not in this movie . These movies should of more like the batman begins \\, Dark knight Christian Bale series . Dark \\, intense\\, gripping. So too me this movie was very big disappointment. So question is number 9 in the series . Only main characters left are Rey and kylo how your going too make a movie out of that have no idea ","true":true}
