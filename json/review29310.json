Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian John and Kathleen Kennedy should be ashamed of themselves for ruining a franchise that has lasted 40 years. The only people who liked this movie are the types that don't think much and are easily amused by bread and circuses\\, or those that were more tied up in the subversive political messaging that runs amok in this film.\\n\\nThis movie should be struck from canon and remade. It's that bad. It's not just the political messaging. It's the storytelling that doesn't make any sense. The movie is filled with so many plot holes and inexplicable actions and decisions\\, that any thinking reviewer should walk out going\\, \\\"Wait... what???\\\" I started listing them out here\\, but this post got so long\\, and I hadn't even scratched the surface.\\n\\nNo - this movie is trash. If Rian Johnson never works again\\, it will be too soon.","true":true}
