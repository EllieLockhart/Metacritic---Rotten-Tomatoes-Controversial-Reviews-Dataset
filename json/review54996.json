Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was horrible\\, it made no sence and what little hope i hade after The Force Awakens is now gone.. they hade so much potential\\, they hade great characters to work with and build up.. Snoke? All the suspence about who he is.. gone.. a fat little chinese girl becomes the new JarJar.. and Luke Skywalker the idol of several generation becomes a laughing stock and an embarrassment... This cannot be saved\\, i will not be paying to see more Star Wars... and i LOVED star wars.","true":true}
