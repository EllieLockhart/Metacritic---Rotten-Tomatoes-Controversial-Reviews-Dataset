Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A good movie I enjoyed good action some good character development with Rey and kylo. I see a romantic vibe coming from then I see why snoke was killed of it made sense it fuelled kylos hate. Yes the movie had bad things like the plot it wasn't that good and the finn rose thing well that was bad. I don't get how people can say this is the worst star wars its probably the4th or 5th best maybe 3rd! \\nThe reasons for it being bad are some dumb reasons\\, Yes that leia scene was dumb the ending was bad as well but the rest was pretty good it also shows that star wars isn't just about the sky walkers  and I think its time for people to stop being whiny about it the movie cant always be what you want it to be!","true":true}
