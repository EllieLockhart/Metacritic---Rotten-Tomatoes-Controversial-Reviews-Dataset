It was brave move that didn't work out at all. I have this feeling that this was someone exclusive idea which he really liked but didn't want to understand that majority of people are going to strongly dislike it.\r\u201cI know you wish things were different (10\/10)\\, I wish things were different but they ain\u2019t\u201d\rYou can extract everything that is best in this game: excellent graphics\\, superb audio\\, superior gameplay\\, awesome acting\\, strong feelings and give it 10\/10.\r\u201cWhen lost in darkness\\, look for the light\u201d\rYou can also grab everything that is the worst and give it 5\/10.\rThis seems like two extremes but maybe not necessarily. Not all of the players played tlou1 before\\, not all of the people are emotionally attached to the game or maybe does not want to (professional reviewers). Without doubt you can stick to something you like or dislike and this is another issue of TLoU2\\, it\u2019s polarizing to extremes. That wasn\u2019t the case with tlou1\\, some liked the story\\, some didn\u2019t but everyone got it\\, understood and appreciated. This was a story at the end you could say: \u201cWow\\, this was a ride\u201d no matter if you agreed with the characters decisions or not. I personally love tlou1 and I know that I\u2019ll return to it someday\\, sadly I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case with tlou2. That being said it\u2019s 7 out of 10 (good but with serious storytelling problems).\u2026 Expand","true":true}
