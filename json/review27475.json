Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall\\, better than The Force Awakens\\, which doesn\u2019t hold up on repeat\\, and planted seeds that poisoned The Last Jedi\\, particularly with regard to Kylo Ren. Not as good as Rogue One\\, and below Return of the Jedi. It\u2019s difficult to imagine how Episode IX can remain interesting with a universe this narrowed and a set of compelling characters reduced to a grand total of two: Kylo and Rey.","true":true}
