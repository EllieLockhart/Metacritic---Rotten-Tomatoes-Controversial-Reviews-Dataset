Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"RJ has never seen star wars\\, has never looked at EU or fan fiction\\, has never played a star wars game or read a comic. It's one thing to go in a new direction. It's another thing to COMPLETELY IGNORE EVERYTHING IN STAR WARS LORE! \\n\\nVisually beautiful\\, but story is terrible\\, character development is non-existent\\, key characters reversed nature and totally disrespected. This critic score is bought! SJW nonsense\\, you guys lost in 2016\\, America culture is not yours to write.","true":true}
