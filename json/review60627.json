We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"An incredible achievement. This game elevates narrative to a level never reached before\\, while delivering tense stealth\\, satisfying combat\\, rewarding progression\\, and some terrifying set-pieces. I don\u2019t buy that anyone actually believes this is 0\/10. Clearly they only rate it that low because they feel upset by it. Why are they upset? Well ND makes some controversial decisions with the story. Chiefly\\, Joel is killed early on and many players seem to feel betrayed by this. There are good reasons why this choice works: Joel has been living a more comfortable life after his recovery from injury in TLoU. He is surprised by the ambush at the house\\, and sure theat is a mistake on his part\\, but he has walked into ambushes before in TLoU\\, so there is a precedent for  this failure.\r\rAlso\\, Joel achieved his redemption in TLoU when he saved Ellie\\, but this action costs him his life. Some reactionaries might not like it\\, but that story makes sense. They think that SJWs are coming to take away their action heroes\\, but Joel was never really that. He was just a dad who lost his kid and was broken by the loss.\r\rAnyway\\, anyone reading through all these 0\/10 ratings should notice that they are all weirdly hostile and aggrieved and not take them seriously. The game is great\\, and is even better on a second play through.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
