Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian must hate JJ to destroy everything The Force Awakens set up and end with the story in shambles. You could try and justify the narrative choices\\, but the sloppiness of it shows the incompetence. They wasted 30 minutes on a side quest just to show a bunch of people in costumes. All the TFA characters are lessened and the pointless Rose character adds very little. ","true":true}
