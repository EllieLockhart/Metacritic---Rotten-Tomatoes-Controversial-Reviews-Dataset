Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I needed this movie to accomplish a few things for me and it did none of them\\, the most egregious being the handling of Luke Skywalker.  Unforgivable and a waste of the strongest Jedi of all time.  Simply put there is just not enough homage paid to the powerful history of Star Wars lore bordering on blasphemy.  You get one lightsaber fight in a 2.5 hour movie and the majority of the movie is a fake out.  My biggest issue with this film is the direction that it puts this Star Wars arc... which is where?  Hopefully right off a cliff so it can just start over.","true":true}
