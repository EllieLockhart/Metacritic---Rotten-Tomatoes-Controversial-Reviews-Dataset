Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Last Jedi resulted in being an abysmal film; the worst Star Wars film of all time\\, topping The Force Awakens.  A horrendous direction has been taken by the new creative heads for this wonderful franchise and story .  Their plot and character decisions have been horrid.  George Lucas is missed.","true":true}
