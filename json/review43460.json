Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this was a terrible movie sacrilege obvious effort to minimize luke  overpower Rey seemed to take more of its story from space balls  we have never hear of ships running outa fuel till now\\, hyper speed attacks\\, the purple hair chick is an obvious nod toward feminism I think it should be deleted and rebooted after the firing of Kathleen kenedy.","true":true}
