Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pros:\\n- Intro space battle scene.\\n- #reylo\\n- Joker-faced Mark Hamill.\\n- The Lanais\\n- Cameo and callbacks done right.\\n- \\\"It's all a machine man.\\\"\\n- Throne room.\\n- Rey's \\\"backstory\\\". Say it.\\n- Hyperspace meets anime.\\n- Samurai-influenced wideshot.\\n- Matrix Luke Skywalker.\\n- Crait.\\n- \\\"This is how we're going to win - not by fighting what we hate\\, but saving what we love.\\\"\\n\\nCons:\\n- MCU-influenced comedy is so out of place.\\n- \\\"Best movie since Empire\\\"\\, says no one ever.\\n- Where is the Rian Johnson who gave me my best TV moment?\\n- John Williams.... what happened to you..??\\n- Did Zack Snyder come to direct a scene?\\n- Feel free to blame Poe Dameron for everything.\\n- Canto Bight is a waste of time.\\n- Phasma is pointless. Bring back TR8R.\\n- Doesn't matter if Snoke was Darth Plagueis or not. Pointless.\\n- So is the Jedi teaching necessary to save the universe\\, or not? Make up your mind\\, Disney.\\n- The Porgs are a money making scheme.\\n- Chewbacca needs more screen time.\\n- May the force be with you\\, JJ Abrams.","true":true}
