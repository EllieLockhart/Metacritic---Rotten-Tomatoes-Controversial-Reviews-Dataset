Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is awful. It's way to comical and the entire movie is a bunch of stupid one liners. They waste 2 very powerful characters that had a ton of potential to be cool. Rian Johnson and Disney can really go suck a fat one for ruining starwars","true":true}
