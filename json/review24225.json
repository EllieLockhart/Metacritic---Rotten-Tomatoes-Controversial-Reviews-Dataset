Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Meh!...Just Ok..nothing special. Could've waited till it got to HBO","true":true}
