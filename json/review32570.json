Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi ... Hopefully the last movie. I went into the theater expecting a darker Star Wars movie\\, major space battles\\, some epic force using by Luke\\, finding out who Snoke is but what I got was far from that. \\\"SPOILER ALERT\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSnoke was completely cut from the plot\\, never finding out who he was or where he came from or what he planned\\nLuke was turned into a coward that barely resembles a Jedi. I was hoping that he possibly bridged both the dark and light sides and taught from that stand point\\, but nooo! He was ruined.\\nReally only one or two cool moments of combat\\, but mostly a running dialog of political correctness and anti-capitalism. Movies are supposed to be an escape\\, not a platform for your political views.\\nBut besides that\\, the movie has what the last one has\\, characters that are poorly developed and no one cares about\\, poor writing\\, poor villains\\, shockingly poor heroes\/heroines\\, SJW bull crap\\, and no story arc.","true":true}
