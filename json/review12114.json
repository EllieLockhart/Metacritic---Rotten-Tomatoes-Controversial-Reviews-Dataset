Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a fan of Star Wars and have always been but this movie makes me want to throw popcorn at the screen. What they did to the hope of the original series was horrible. Not to mention the plot holes it created and took the force awaken questions and threw them out the window. Rian Johnson seems to only care about making this movie set up for his new trilogy.","true":true}
