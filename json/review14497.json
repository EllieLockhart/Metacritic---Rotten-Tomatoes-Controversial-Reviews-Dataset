Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hated this movie. This is a franchise breaking film. This movie is such a slap in the face for anyone who waited 30 years to see Luke Skywalker on screen again that I threw away my copy of the force awakens. The turned the greatest hero in Star Wars into a cowardly loser that refuses to help his family\\, then he pointlessly dies at the end\\, such a huge disappointment and insult. ","true":true}
