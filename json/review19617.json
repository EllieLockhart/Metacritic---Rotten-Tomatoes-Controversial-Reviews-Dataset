Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a bit of a disappointment. There was a lot of comedy aimed at an audience too young to be watching a movie like this. It felt almost like an after school kids comedy at times like Saved By The Bell. The plot wasn't great. It seemed as though the writers and directors found the pre-existing plot of Star Wars an inconvenience they needed to find ways to work around. On a positive note the actors gave a great performance.","true":true}
