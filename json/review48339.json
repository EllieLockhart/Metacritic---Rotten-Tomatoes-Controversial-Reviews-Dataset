Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Why we cannot get a real villain\\, someone dark\\, with a real history\\, something to remember?\\nWhy we cannot have real Jedi\\, with standards about being a Jedi? Do they really need to make fun on every part of being a Jedi?\\nWhy everything needs to be made on Marvel way where everything is a joke? In that case\\, get Joss Whedon and everything will be like FireFly.\\nMay we get a real writer who can build characters a real story to stay with us for years to come? A lot of SW books have good stories and characters\\, get one of those writers and make them write the story\\, not these wannabe writers\/directors.\\nAnd now we have to endure 3 more SW movies with this guy??? I mean\\, really? God saves us\\, RIP Star Wars\\, welcome Marvel second universe.","true":true}
