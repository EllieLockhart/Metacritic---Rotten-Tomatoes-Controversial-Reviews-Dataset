Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke Skywalker isn't the kind of person that will try to kill his own nephew. The way he just throw away the lightsaber is like a parody of star wars.\\nLike Force Awaken\\, we can see Disney trying hard to push out feminism\\, female hero\\, everyone in the Resistance leadership is woman? It is just too obvious and unacceptable. how is it possible for Rey to overpower jedi master Luke Skywalker? This doesn't make sense at all. The choice of actors and actress they chose is just ridiculous. Kylo Ren's face make him look like a villian from Highschool musical than a sith. It is better if he never took of that mask.","true":true}
