Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Legitimately questioned whether the film I was watching was actually The Last Jedi or if the cast had filmed an elaborate spoof. This is a hideously bad film\\, the dialogue is atrocious and the plot makes little to no sense. I found myself laughing all the way through but not at the parts that were supposed to be funny\\, the humour in this film is cringey beyond belief. I am completely at a loss as to how Disney actually let this monstrosity be created. Supposedly this 'director' has been given another trilogy of Star Wars films to make. Well\\, they will certainly crash and burn.","true":true}
