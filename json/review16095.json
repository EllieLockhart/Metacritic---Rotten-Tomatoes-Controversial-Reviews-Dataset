Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a star wars fan since about 25 years and I never thought I could ever hate a star wars movie nor that it could be ever that bad\\, that I have to. I loved Rogue One and was positive surprised by episode 7. Even for me as a big fan of the expanded universe it was a movie I can live with. But episode 8 I will try to forget. I just have to. It looks like Star wars and has great effects\\, no question. But the story is lame\\, the cheap jokes made my beloved characters just ridiculous. I dislike the way they present Luke Skywalker. I dislike how they present Leia. I dislike how they present the force as overpowered at the one side and as source of bad jokes at the other. I just dislike almost everything in this movie. It felt like more Spaceballs 2 and seriously I had to ask myself a few times\\, if I'm awake or have a very bad dreaming. They just can't mean this crap for serious...","true":true}
