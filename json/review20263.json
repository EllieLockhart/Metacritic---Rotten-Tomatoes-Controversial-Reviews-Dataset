Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was sad to see my husband and my 13 year old son\\, both Star Wars fans since birth\\, walk out of that movie theater so disappointed after walking in with so much excitement.  I can see that if you have never watched a Star Wars film how this one could be good\\, but if you are a fan of the story and legacy this movie just didn't live up to that.  Especially if you love Luke Skywalker and everything he has stood for for 4 decades.  The team that put this together totally missed it and judging by the all of the negativity surrounding this film lots of people would agree.  I really don't know what else to say except boo and shame on Disney.","true":true}
