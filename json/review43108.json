Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This nocie is the most un-starwars movie in existance. It is absolutely awful in its execution creating numerous plot holes and laying waste to anticipated characters such as luke skywalker. We learned nearly nothing of the main characters in the film and had 1\/2 hr of rose and fin on the casino planet (the most un-starwars moment in the entire film) only to have that part be undermined by he betrayl of the hacker guy. Overall the experince was unimaginative and unenjoyable. If you're after a good starwars sequel rewatch Empire Stirkes Back.","true":true}
