Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi built up so many moments that could have actually been amazing with slight changes. By staying inside the box and being vanilla (as Disney probably wanted) the movie dragged truly angering anyone who is more than a casual fan. The disrespect shown to character development and actual plot is nothing short of disgusting. The plot goes nowhere leaving an unsatisfied taste in the viewers mouth. No questions were answered and clearly Disney is only in it for the money. Since Revenge of the Sith I have seen every Star Wars in theaters multiple times. This like the jedi\\, has to end. Slowly if no major change is made Disney will kill Star Wars and their loyal fanbase. JJ Abrams is a monster and should be led as far away from these films as possible. I don't think he has ever had an original thought and certainly does not have the balls to actually put it on screen.","true":true}
