Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to like this movie\\, I laughed in a couple of jokes that the movie suddenly cracked\\, my main concern is that it doesn't feel like a SW movie\\, it feels like something completely new. Not everything needs to be Empire Strikes Back\\, I embrace directors to take chances but lot of scenes feel just off\\, in the end there is a lot information\\, that was not revealed on episode VII and it was unnecessary held for this movie. The main characters did a great job kudos for Mark Hamill and Adam Driver\\, but there is at least half hour of the movie that can be cut. Love the franchise but this will be an inflection point\\, for me.","true":true}
