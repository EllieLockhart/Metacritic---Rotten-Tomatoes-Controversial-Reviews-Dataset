Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dropped 40 years of character development for no apparent reason. there were elements that were cool\\, and visually interesting\\, but overall made me feel like the Star Wars had finally been Disneyified. An EPIC saga of a GALAXIES struggle reduced to 20 people on a cargo freighter. The scope is reduced to 3 feet in from of viewer instead of the massive arcing story Lucas started telling 40 years ago. Too many jokes\\, people dying and then jokes - WTF? Giant plot holes and tons of stuff that doesn't make sense. Could have called this movie \\\"Other space stuff\\\" and it would have been \\\"OK\\\" but this is bad stewardship of the Star Wars brand.  Missed opportunity to continue to be the cultural guide for a new generation all in the name of more merchandising. I think the fan base will start treating this movie just like any other - nothing special - something you might do if the kids are bored\\, but otherwise will wait until it shows up in cable TV. - I generously give it 3 stars because it's star wars and I like the cast - bur the story was a huge disappointment.","true":true}
