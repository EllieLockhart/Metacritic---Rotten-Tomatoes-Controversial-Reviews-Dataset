Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good special effects for the most part. Story it'self is a hap hazard series of dumb events that have little to no connectivity to the saga its meant to be continuing\\, and in its place are new characters with no back story involved in events that have little relevance. It's basically 2 hours of social issues wrapped in very thin coating of star wars that lacks all the depth\\, all the magic\\, all the story telling of what star wars is. Absolute massive fail as far as star wars goes. But hey\\, millennials and the instant gratification generation lap that shallow crap up like the star wars ignorant sheep they are.","true":true}
