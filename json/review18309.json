Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought they hit rock bottom with The Rehash Awakens. I was wrong...Please Disney\\, scrap these two movies\\, pretend like they never happened\\, ya know\\, the way you did with the HUNDREDS of Star Wars books you now call \\\"Legends\\,\\\" and for the love of Star Wars give this franchise BACK to George and let him tell us the REAL STORY...this is gargabe.","true":true}
