Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Total letdown. (SPOILERS AHEAD) It\u2019s like wtf movie were these reviewers watching? Luke is a whiner and a failed master who doesn\u2019t even cross blades before dying. Leia flying through space like Ms. Marvel. Snoke dying without any backstory. Then compound this with the dreck from TFA like the utterly lazy concept of the first order. Not to mention that they chase the rebel fleet for hours and can\u2019t destroy it because they stay just out of range? Wtf? Terrible movie on so many levels. ","true":true}
