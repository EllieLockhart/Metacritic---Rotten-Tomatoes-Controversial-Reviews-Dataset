To put in plain and simple wording if you're looking for a repeat of the critically acclaimed The Last of Us in Part II\\, you unfortunately won't find it. While visuals and musical composition are frankly stunning the writing and pacing of the story finds that many characters fall flat. We revisit characters from the previous entry in Joel\\, Ellie and Tommy to name a few\\, but what we find is a vastly changed dynamic leading to some pretty questionable character direction.\r\rThe game attempts to introduce new characters on it's quest to subvert expectations and \\\"challenge your perception of justice and empathy.\\\" Instead of doing that in a way that's reasonable\\, by dedicating a similar amount of time to the character introduced in TLOU2\\, what this entry does is barely give us an idea of who the new entry to the line up is and then have them fundamentally change everything about the story.\r\rWhile we are meant to identify with this character instead they become a target of hatred and anger which is understandable given the journey of TLOU and how they impact it's meaning. That's not to say that their story direction can't be understood\\, their motives and efforts are in fact reasonable\\, but it's presented in such a way that feels so hollow and meaningless. Many likely knew that reprecussions from TLOU were on their way in one form or another\\, but the shady marketing and questionable direction of characters make it all the more unforgiveable.\r\rThis game is not worth a 0 review\\, and it will be polarising depending on who is playing\\, this game is far above average\\, but it just misses the mark on so much of what made TLOU special. Whether the game's director believe it or not\\, Joel was not the cornerstone of what made TLOU iconic in it's genre. It was the exploration of identifiable\\, human traits and the journey two people had together in a world unforgiving to them. It was the identification of what made people\\, people and how that played out in the story that made TLOU so interesting and addictive to play\\, but TLOU2 seems to have hollowed itself out from that ideal and falls short of the original as a result.\r\rI do hate assigning a number\\, and tried to provide one that reflected my thoughts after my most recent playthrough. I'd recommend lovers of the original TLOU to purchase cautiously and perhaps either second hand or when on sale\\, as I imagine there will be -a lot- of second hand copies available shortly.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
