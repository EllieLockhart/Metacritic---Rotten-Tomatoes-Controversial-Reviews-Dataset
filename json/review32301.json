Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"star wars has always been a mysterious movie. The fifth episode ended with the revelation that Dart Vader os Luke's father and ldea of ??how it happened .. who and the mother\\, how he became that. these things are also not explained soon\\, and a construction. Expect the film to be like this and go against the principles of the saga. Do not fill the bag. The film needed to create its own story and disassociate itself from the old trilogy.","true":true}
