Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok so as movie it's a really great movie\\, as a star wars continuity it's up for debate\\, yea there were some answers that were never answered and some side plots we didn't ask for but then again in the original star wars I didn't really care much for Palpatine or for some of the Jedi in the prequels\\, I wanted more Darth maul\\, boba fett and Darth Vader cause they were cool\\, now saying that this movie was eye candy\\, it's just to bad we didn't see some more phasma\\, what I consider the new boba fett in this trilogy\\, hopefully we get a really cool fight scene in the next movie ","true":true}
