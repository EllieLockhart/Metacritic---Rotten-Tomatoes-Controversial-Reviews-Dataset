Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too light a film and has gone a galaxy far far away from the originals that were darker and had more depth. From the opening joke phone call like banter direct to the general. This was aimed as Disney films are\\, the younger audience....we now even have a cute toy I am sure.\\n\\nI left the cinema thinking \\\"what was the point of this\\\" I hoped with the return of Luke this was going to be back to the greats.\\nAverage at best","true":true}
