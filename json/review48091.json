Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the last jedi is very good in terms of imagery\\, the story is a straight-line plot designed for kids\\, not many twists. While enjoyable\\, it lacks the impact the other movies had.","true":true}
