Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie does not deserve the hate it's been getting. Though I love the Star wars movies dearly\\, this is probably the first Star Wars movie that had a truly compelling overall message. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous and it's beautifully shot. There are plot conveniences and plot lines that aren't completely necessary\\, but that's present in many movies and I found it rather easy to look past\\, especially since I think the side plots really helped strengthen the movie's themes. I would rank this movie right up there with A New Hope and The Emipire Strikes Back.","true":true}
