Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It has moments of resonance and brilliance\\, and those moments make the movie worth seeing.  However\\, outside of those flashes\\, the movie is a mess-plot\\, tone\\, and characters never settle in.  For all of the stakes (the battle for the soul of the force and the survival of the rebellion)\\, the characters don't ever seem to take it too seriously.  Quips and gags abound even when a situation would be better served by real pathos and character development.  The plot is muddied and seems driven more by necessity than logic.  Side plots seem to exist solely to give otherwise underused characters some screen time.  There are also cameos by beloved characters (new and old) that seem to be inserted to provide fan service rather than add to the film.  The Last Jedi is two and a half hours long\\, and it feels every minute of it.  Much of the movie feels drawn out (and thin).  But for all of its flaws\\, there are wonderous parts.  The acting is superb-Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher provide gravitas and carry the emotional center of the film. The action and battles are spectacular\\, not quite Rogue One label\\, but close.  These positives are not enough to save it\\, but they are enough to keep hope for the franchise alive.  And as long as there is hope\\, not all is lost.","true":true}
