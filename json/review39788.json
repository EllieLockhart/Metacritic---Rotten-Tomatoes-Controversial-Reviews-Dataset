Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is an excellent\\, exciting stand-alone\\, action\\, adventure\\, science fiction film. Unfortunately it just isn't star wars! \\nThe characters are all over the place\\, Leia has become super-woman\\, Snoke is killed long before the end of the film\\, so no antagonist for the next one and phasma has been one of the biggest character let downs in recent cinema history\\, apparently a man who used to mop up can beat her. As I say I really enjoyed this film on its own terms\\, it just doesn't make any sense within the larger star wars mythos.","true":true}
