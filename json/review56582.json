Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is an odd film that does not try to \\\"fit in\\\" with the existing Star Wars films\\, but rather expects you to follow it where it leads -- and this is an excellent thing. \\nFirst and foremost: This film is not a rehash of The Empire Strikes Back. While there are several scenes that act as homage's\\, in nearly every case you will find that the story has tricked you into an expectation that is about to be shattered.\\n\\nIf the Force Awakens can be criticized for being \\\"too safe\\\" of a film\\, The Last Jedi is the polar opposite. It takes many risks with the Star Wars formula\\, lore\\, and characters. While viewers entrenched in old expectations or \\\"sure-thing\\\" fan theories may find themselves thrown into the deep end\\, any Star Wars fan ready to open their mind to a completely new experience is in for a treat.\\n\\nFitting with this\\, the film's major themes include finding oneself\\, learning that change is inevitable but not always bad\\, and\\, most importantly\\, taking responsibility for one's past mistakes.\\n\\nHighly recommended film for any Star Wars fan\\, just be sure to go in with an open mind and clean slate. Expect new changes and not just \\\"more Star Wars.\\\"","true":true}
