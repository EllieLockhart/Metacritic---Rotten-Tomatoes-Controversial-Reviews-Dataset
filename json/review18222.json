Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought liking the Phantom Menace was because I could like anything \\\"Star Wars.\\\" The Last Jedi has proven that to be false. I understand this is the new Star Wars\\, but to achieve it we saw the franchise flipped on its head. And people love it. Maybe my time with Star Wars is at an end. Disney is taking it down a path that\\, at this moment\\, I can't follow. Maybe Episode IX will bring it all together. Maybe a second showing of TLJ will make me feel better. But Star Wars has finally disappointed me and others\\, and it seems we are simply the small Resistance to the greater threat of the mysterious Episode VIII.","true":true}
