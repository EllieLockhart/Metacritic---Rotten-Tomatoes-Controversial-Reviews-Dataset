Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not what I expected or wanted. Not entirely unwelcome but I did not get any of my questions from episode 7 answered. Didn't feel as interesting or epic as episode 7. This could have been an anthology movie and had a 'real' episode 8 instead. Very little gravity to the movie aside from character deletion.","true":true}
