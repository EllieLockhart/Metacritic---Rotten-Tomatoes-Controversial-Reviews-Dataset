Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Though I can understand why this is a unpopular opinion\\, I think most of this game were amazing and well developed.  Yes I do believe Abby's story was drawn out and input some pointless details and the while time we were still angry because she killed our protagonist from the first game.  However her story shows that she may not have been a bad person or at least no better than any other human trying to survive.  And then theres how Joel died\\, I know some thought it did not do him any justice\\, but in a real apocalyptic scenario\\, it's unlikely he would go out a hero\\, or guns blazing or in some way that made players ls happy.  And then there was the end of the game itself\\, I know personally I was broken\\, I was sad\\, and there was no happy ending\\, Abby lived\\, Joel was dead\\, Tommy was injured and begrudging toward Ellie\\, and Dina and JJ were gone\\, the last image we see is Ellie walking into the distance not knowing was happening next.  Now I thought this ending (though it hurt) was genuine and realistic\\, Ellie lost more than what she started with\\, it would be impossible for her to have come out on top\\, and we see that\\, we see the price of revenge.  And more importantly we see there are not always happy ending. The whole game is a beautiful\\, sad\\, and dark masterpiece of storytelling\\, and an insight into the price of revenge.  Though I saw it was highly unlikely I believe that this ending sets up another sequel where we may see\\, l the ending we want.  But until that is announced we must deal with the  what we got and understand\/ process this unique and realistic form of storytelling.  *THIS IS AN OPINION*\u2026 Expand","true":true}
