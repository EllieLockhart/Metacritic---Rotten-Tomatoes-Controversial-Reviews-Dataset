Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the most EPIC Star Wars film so far!! The action was nearly non stop. The script was very solid and Finn character finally stopped being the joke of the crew and seriously stepped up and refined his character\\, he grew a pair. I\u2019ve noticed lot of haters\\, can\u2019t see why. Perhaps because it had some serious body count. Not gory or graphic but let\u2019s just say it was serious stuff but easy enough for the young to watch. Perhaps that was the disappointment in so many people. No gore. Besides that\\, it was heavy heavy action. ","true":true}
