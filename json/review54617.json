Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I must admit... I had a great time with the last jedi. Being really excited about the movie leaving the theater for the first time\\, the first thing I wanted to do when I got back home was to share my experience of the movie with other people that had seen it. This eventually left me really down and depressed. Being met with outrageous claims that \\\"Star wars is dead\\\" and all those 1000 other outbursts currently dividing the fanbase. And here I am feeling that here is this really great film that I really liked\\, but which I am told I have no business liking at all. I have my own gripes about the movie\\, who doesn't? All I'm saying is that we can't all be directors in the star wars universe.\\n It's easy to wish that things were different\\, but at the end of the day it is what it is. Oh boy I'm glad the internet wasn't around when return of the jedi came out. I mean... imagine all the ewok memes\\, complaints about Leia kissing her brother in back in Empire\\, Boba Fett's death\\, complicated carbonite Han rescue plan\\, deathstar rehash and beyond... Growing up\\, Rotj was my favorite star wars movie\\, and I'm sure that future star wars fans will be more forgiving about the last jedi than what we are now.  \\nI sure am really excited about episode 9. Anything can happen now. Just that fact alone\\, that we are 8 movies into the Skywalker saga and I have no idea how the next movie will be like\\, really makes me excited about being a star wars fan in these modern times.","true":true}
