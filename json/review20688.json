{"101487":146144,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-26","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've watched TLJ twice... I still don't know if what to think of it overall. It's a great Sci-Fi action movie but it's just not Star Wars. The visuals were great\\, and the music score was better than TFA!\\n\\nHowever it doesn't fit in the current trilogy as it does nothing to advance the overall arc. I mean it failed to answer most of the questions from TFA\\, and the few it did answer left me thinking WTF???\\n\\nAs for the strong female lead; my daughter is starting to question how Rey has become so powerful without having any of the training that Luke from the original trilogy or Snips from Clone Wars had.\\n\\nPhasma was underused.. I mean her death was worse than Bobba Fett being knocked into the Sarlacc Pit. The purple haired lady was a waste... Why not give Admiral Ackbar the cool death? As for Luke... seriously?\\n\\nUPDATED: Yep.. Rian dun did good...\\n\\nHe just forgot some basic rules to making good stories...\\n\\nSetup without payoff.\\n-Showing Luke's X-Wing but never doing anything with it.\\n-The appearances of the fem stormtrooper and Akbar. You expect something cool\\, and they die like chumps.  \\n-Purple Hair's reason for not telling the evacuation plan. Everyone wants to know why she didn't\\, but we get no answers\\, so it just looks moronic.\\n-Knights of Ren were talked about but never appeared. \\n-Golden dice might count. My guess is that this is a setup for something in the Han Solo movie\\, but it really should have been a payoff to something that already has significance.\\n-Rey's connection with the lightsaber. We don't know why she could see images from touching it\\, and it seems like we never will. Probably it was just to give her a reason to search for Luke. \\n-Luke leaving the map to find him when he never wanted anyone to do so. I believe this one was retconned away.\\n-Slave children are found\\, but left to rot while the animals are saved instead (PETA may disagree with this one).\\n\\nPayoff without setup.\\n-Having Luke Force project w\/o any hint that it's even possible.\\n-The hyperspace ramming scene. You can't just throw a tactic like that when no one has EVER considered it a viable move before. Also\\, why can't the autopilot be used?\\n-Yoda using lightning\\, which completely changes how we view the power of force ghosts. \\n-The Force becoming a super power that requires no training. Fans assumed Rey was able to do what she did in The Force Awakens because it's impossible for it to be done without training\\, but it turns out she can because she is the Chosen One. Which makes no sense because Anakin\\, someone created by the force\\, wasn't able to to this stuff without training. Then a random slave is also shown to be able to do a force pull\\, and then Star Wars became Marvel. \\n-Rey being better at lightsaber fighting than Ren. Fans said that she only won\\, in Episode 7\\, because X reason\\, but it turns out she really is just that good. Annoying thing is that they could have explained it as psychometry\\, since this is a specific power she has. Just have it that she can use the skills of the previous lightsaber wielder\\, and when it was destroyed\\, she suddenly wasn't able to fight well. \\n-Killing Snoke. How was Ren able to do this when he can't really hide his emotions? Why did he consider Snoke to be his true enemy\\, and not Rey?\\n-Ren becoming the new Ruler. You can't just kill the head of state and become the new ruler without some significant backing.\\n-Rey's interest in Ren. Episode ended with her HATING Ren\\, but she had a 180 with little justification.\\n-Ren embracing the dark side. Killing Han didn't work\\, he couldn't bring himself to kill Leia\\, then he kills Snoke and goes full evil? What?\\n-Space gas. Since when was fuel an issue? If you want to trap the fleet in some way\\, use an existing mechanism. There are ways to stop ships from going into hyperspace. \\n\\nStole many of these ideas from a poster in another video (one of many) that explain why TLJ was not as good as it could've been....?\\n\\nRecap TLJ is not complete crap. The visuals are amazing\\, and I really did love the musical scores. The weak story however has left even my daughter not interested in seeing the movie again. Unlike TFA this movie completely misses on the \\\"Star Wars\\\" Magic. Sadly I don't know if I will be able to convince my daughter to come with me to episode 9 after this. Just in case it matters to you my daughter is 8yrs old and over all really likes Star Wars overall with Clone Wars being her favorite show. She really likes Snips...","true":true}
