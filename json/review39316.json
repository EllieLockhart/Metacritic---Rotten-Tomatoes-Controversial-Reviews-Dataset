{"101487":180974,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is almost like a parody of Star Wars. \\nI was lead to believe that this was supposed to be dark\\, serious\\, emotional; yet it turned out to be half sci-fi half comedy. (SPOILERS AHEAD)\\n\\n- Luke's character is completely wasted\\, there was so much potential for him to have a grand entrance\\, change the lore\\, further the plot\\, and have a meaningful conclusion. Yet they chose to make his opening scene start out with comedy\\, and kill him of exhaustion\\, or whatever..?\\n\\n- Leia officially has developed her force powers to the point where she can sustain herself in the cold void of space\\, and force pull herself through that space like superman. Vader could not live without his mask\\, despite being one of the most powerful force users ever\\, even after being turned into more machine than man. \\n\\n- Rey still does not get any official jedi training other than audio lessons about the force and the hypocrisy of the Jedi\\, yet takes out multiple praetorian guards at the same time\\, and lifts thousands of pounds of rocks. Luke could not lift the X-Wing after training with Yoda\\, who has been teaching Jedi for centuries. So\\, Mary Sue much?\\n\\n- WAAAAAAYYYY too much comedy in this movie. It's not that the comedy wasn't funny\\, it's that it felt like almost every other scene of this film was a comedy bit. The opening dialogue of the film is comedic. Also\\, Yoda is comic relief. Sigh.\\n\\n-  The film is very inconsequential as a whole. It doesn't really world build much at all or further the general story\\, other than the rebellion being in the same boat it's almost always been in\\, which is losing some and winning some. It does not expand upon the lore very much\\, other than the new abilities like force skype\\, and force astral projection(which apparently kills you\\, no matter how powerful of a force user you are). \\n\\n- Characters Finn\\, Poe\\, and Rose did not actually progress anywhere. Finn and Rose's sole purpose was to be filler in this film\\, then fight phasma\\, and kiss (come on?! seriously with the cliche?!). Poe is there to be annoyed with the stand in for Leia\\, a good pilot to win against any odds\\, and say\\, \\\"we're the spark that will light the fire to the rebellion\\\" in a cool way to play on the audiences emotions and provide exposition as to the point of the film.\\n\\n- Speaking on that ^.. What is the point of this film? Is it so that we can watch a 2 1\/2 hour lock in between the rebels and the first order? Could you really not come up with a better story than that? Like idk\\, using the last of the fuel reserves to land on a planet(take us to another world with interesting dynamics perhaps?)\\, defend the fortifications long enough to refuel the ship so that you can light speed through the ships (which was cool by the way\\, thank you) whilst being in an interesting place other than a cruiser? \\n\\n- ^ That's just the rebellion side of the story too. The mysticism side of the story\\, or the lore of the jedi\\, sith\\, and the force went pretty much nowhere. We found out that Luke knows of the Jedi's failures and hypocrisy\\, that Snoke is still just a random villain with no other motive than to simply kill the rebels\\, Rey is incredibly powerful with almost no effort. Again\\, could we not have used Luke's masterful force potential for something more cool? \\n\\n- The film mainly doesn't set well with me because I was led to believe that this was going to be a seriously dark toned story\\, (the trailers\\, the red and white drab colors on the marketing\\, \\\"it's time for the jedi to end\\\"\\, the dark\\, menacing music and tone of the trailers) and then we got a film that dumps on the lore\\, spits on Luke\\, is stationary throughout half the runtime\\, drags on\\, uses every opportunity to get a laugh(Thanks Disney)\\, and disrespects all of the fans who expected the star wars movie that you lead them to believe was to be. It doesn't matter to me if every fan theory was wrong\\, it doesn't matter if i didnt get what *I* wanted\\, what I do care about is you giving me what you lead me this film was going to be.","true":true}
