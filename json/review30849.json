Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So as a big star wars fan i have seen this movie twice\\, once with my wife\\, and once with whole family. Too be blunt i wanted to like it a lot\\, but  my expectations were so high the first time\\, I think it was a major let down in some ways. Upon a second viewing however\\, i liked it more and saw the appeal for the new Star Wars generation. While i think Rian Johnson took a crap on everything JJ Abrams set up\\, it is still a decent action movie and we get some some good development\\, even if it was way outside anything i was expecting. Also i Love !!! all the actors in this they do their best to convey the story\\, all of them including the new additions are fantastic. But what i really don't like about this movie is  the fragmented story telling ( with plot lines that don't go anywhere)\\, Some of the humor is way over the top\\, so much so i think it reminds us this is just a movie vs trying to transport us into this other universe for the long 2 and half hours we are watching this movie...  Finally i think while trying to make a major Carrie Fisher tribute ( which i think was a great idea)\\, they ruin it by giving her probably one of the dumbest and goofiest things to happen in  Star Wars..","true":true}
