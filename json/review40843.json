Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie collectively made Luke Skyealker look like a total wimp and essentially threw away his story arch from the original trilogy. Johnson wants us to care about the \\\"new\\\"characters\\, but doesn't give us anything to actually care about. There were so many scenes and moments where this movie could have excelled\\, but decided to go down a path that made it nearly unwatchable and cringeworthy. I think that it is time for Star Wars to get directors that are not only fans of the movies\/franchise but want to honor and enhance it...not destroy it. They need to understand the balance of nostalgia\\, parallels\\, and new stuff while keeping true to what started it all.","true":true}
