Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many point (many already stated)\\nCons\\n- Luke Skywalker ending\\, and character let down. Organa Solo let down.  \\n- No real villains left\\, No real character develeopement\\n- Major plot holes (a chase that didn't need to be a chase\\, possible quicker ending that could have saved lives)\\n- Unnecessary plot detours (ya... that casino part -_-)\\nPros: \\n- Special effects","true":true}
