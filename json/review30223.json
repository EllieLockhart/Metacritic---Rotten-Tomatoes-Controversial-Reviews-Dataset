Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw it. Tried to like it. Tried really hard.\\nThis movie has no direction\\, no understanding of its characters and its pacing was aweful.\\nThis move was on par with Indiana Jones and the Crystak Skull kinda bad. Justice League\/ Suicide Squad bad.\\n\\nThis movie was phantom menace and attack of the clones kinda bad.\\n\\nThanks for shitting all over Luke and turning Carrie Fisher into the most powerful jedi fpr absolutely no reason.\\n\\nTruly. Fuck you Rian!!!\\n\\nThis movie was awful","true":true}
