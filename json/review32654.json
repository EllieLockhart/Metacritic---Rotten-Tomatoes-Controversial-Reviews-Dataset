Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is not only a good movie; it improves the Star Wars canon. \\n\\n(NO SPOILERS) \\n\\nTLJ had to meet impossible expectations: it had to be on brand for a Star Wars movie and yet unpredictable\\, unexpected\\, and surprising. It had to avoid the pitfalls of the Lucas-era prequels (too different from the original trilogy) and that of the JJ Abrams reboot (too similar to the original trilogy). \\n\\nTLJ met all those expectations. It *felt* like a Star Wars movie but expanded what it means to \\\"be Star Wars.\\\" \\n\\nJohnson made his name writing and directing movies from all the most brain-bending genres\\, such as a time-travel film (Looper)\\, a noir whodunnit (Brick)\\, and a film about two professional con men (Brothers Bloom). TLJ had enough twists and turns to keep audiences guessing the entire film\\, complete with a surprise ending.","true":true}
