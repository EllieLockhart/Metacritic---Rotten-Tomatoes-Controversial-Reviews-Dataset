Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great film. I'm a bit disappointed at how art focused it was instead of plot focused. I felt like Disney put too much of their own style to the film\\, when they should have kept more of what Star Wars originally was.","true":true}
