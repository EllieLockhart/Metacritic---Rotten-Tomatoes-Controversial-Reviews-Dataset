Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The character DJ was underutilized.\\nThe film could have explored the Grey Side of the force\\, but seemed to get scared of deviating into interesting story telling.\\nLuke Skywalker died unnecessarily.\\nLeia should have died\\, but she suddenly became a green lantern and flew through space.\\n\\nI loved the climax throne room scene\\, but it let me down in the end. Half of the movie ended up being unnecessary. In fact\\, it was like the whole movie made a point of Finn being a useless character.\\n\\nPoe got almost equally terrible treatment. He was just a useless idiot.\\n\\nI know I said it already\\, but I liked DJ a lot. I wanted more of him. I'd watch a show based entirely on him.\\n\\nLazy writing... The studio seems to have a great third movie planned\\, and this installment in the trilogy feels as though it was meant to kill time. It sort of seems like the stuff you'd usually see in the scrolling text explaining a time skip between previous Star Wars entries.","true":true}
