Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can see why people are mixed on this\\, because this movie is deliberately burning a lot of the tropes of star wars around it.  Sci-fi fans (re: nerds) aren't really great at embracing change.  I can say that\\, because I'm one of them.  but once you realize that the movie isn't literally setting fire you your action figures but is instead telling a story that is deliberately and sucessfully undermining all the tropes of the genre while sucessfully subverting ALL of your expectations\\, how could you not like it?\\n\\nUnless\\, you know\\, those expectations are part of your identity.  then you have some issues.","true":true}
