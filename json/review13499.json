Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I feel as though critics have been screened a different film than the one I watched. \\nId like to say that I am by no means a fan boy. I did not watch trailers leading up to this films release nor am I emotionally involved with the Star Wars legacy.\\nThat being said ... this was a flat out terrible film. And I really mean that. This is the first movie I've ever watched that made plot decisions at the EXPENSE of its own audience. Nothing more needs to be said.","true":true}
