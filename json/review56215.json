Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars is the most influential franchise for boys in America for the last 40 years.  Was Disney incompetent with this movie\\, or were they trying to actively ruin the Star Wars that fans loved?  Serious question.  Sometimes the timing and delivery of humor is off\\, and it just does not work.  Sometimes plot twists are telegraphed\\, and big reveals are predictable\\, sometimes actor chemistry just does not work.  sometimes bad luck happens to a movie\\, but this is bad enough to question whether it is by intent.  \\n\\nI am suspicious that Disney wanted to break the masculine influence on Star Wars in an attempt to make it more inclusive.  In so\\, they have destroyed many significant characters to the franchise\\, and abandoned its traditional narrative of action\\, adventure\\, and escape.  I understand that if you want to bring in a new group of female characters to dominate the show you will have to kill off the men\\, literally and figuratively\\, but did they need to kill off all of the male fans in the process?  This has gone beyond inclusion\\, and turned into a cultural genocide of brain cells.  Poor story\\, poor characters\\, poor humor\\, drags on far too long\\, trying so hard for diversity it forgets to be a good movie at the same time.  We all think diversity is a good thing\\, but this terrible movie may have set the cause of inclusiveness back a full generation.  Where are the girls to take the mantle when a man fails\\, where is the female to take leadership when her male commander falls.  Where are the females characters uniting people?  Star Wars fans deserved a great and inclusive movie\\, Disney just forgot about the \\\"great movie\\\" part.","true":true}
