Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All the critics this is the middle of the series did you really expect answers to anything. Luke was Luke go back and check he always been I can't do this kind of guy. Remember back when Yoda trained him it was always I can't do this or it's to hard. Same with Anakin in the first three before he became darth vader his constant whining. So you can't tell me that wASN'T Luke. The Movie covered all the parts needed in a middle movie. Now we wonder who else is coming back Yoda\\,Luke\\, or who Rey's parents really are. Hopefully all will be answered in 2 years.  I have seen every Star Wars movie when they originally came out and all of them went to the last part of the trilogy to find out all the answers.","true":true}
