Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are so many things wrong with this film. It shows up primarily in the story & its continuation from its predecessor. Yes\\, its a direct sequel but answers very few questions posed from the 1st movie: Who is Snoke? How does he seduce Been to become Kylo? How did he come to power. Why was there a Resistance in The Force Awakens when there was a functional government in place? Why wasn't that government openly opposing The First Order. Other issues include character development. It seems that only Poe's character shows any growth from TFA to TLJ. Rey is still searching for direction & Finn is still searching for Rey. The legend of Luke Skywalker was handled perfectly\\, until the end. The choices made to end his arc were almost criminal. As always\\, these films look beautiful but it lacks substance.","true":true}
