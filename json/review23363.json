Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it. Story was solid\\, fun and well delivered. The dynamic between Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley was amazing. Mark Hamill\u2019s return as Luke Skywalker was worth the wait.","true":true}
