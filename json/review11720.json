Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"how can you make 2.5 hour movie and not conclude the chapter. Oh wait! they made a trilogy so its not just 2.5 hours. I give up man. I don't want to keep watching only to leave with a feeling that I have to wait a few more years and another set of trilogy to see the conclusion. Sucks","true":true}
