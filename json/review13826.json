Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If someone asked me to spoil him this movie i really would not know how as nothing happens\\, plot is so bad that even \\\"The Phantom Menace\\\" has better plot than this. Luke the guy who believed in Vader just decided that he wants to kill his own nephew just because he \\\"saw\\\" something\\, give me a break. Yoda casually summing lighting to burn down the tree even though he is just a force spirit. And do not even make me to start about Rey classic \\\"Mary Sue\\\" with zero trainer lifting rocks like they are nothing and fighting like she is a fully trained Jedi Master. Fin\/Rose plot is so useless and they have 0 chemistry. Overall the worst Star Wars movie i have ever seen.","true":true}
