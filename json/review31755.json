Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Space fuel\\, pointless porgs\\, no backstory for Snoke\\, Rey's parents weak reveal.. not sure where to start. If you're a die-hard fan like myself\\, you have no choice but to go see it just don't expect much.","true":true}
