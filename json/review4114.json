Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Brilliant subversion of expectations. Shocked by Rey being a \\\"Nobody\\\" but the more I think about it the more I can't see any other option being more important for both the plot and the future of the franchise. Rose saving Finn was a strange scene as there is no guarantee that such a maneuver would have not ended up killing them both and the kiss scene was quite awkward and out of left field. Admiral Holdo was powerful and brilliant\\, and still heartbroken that Carrie won't be back to cap this trilogy after Leia's scenes in this one.","true":true}
