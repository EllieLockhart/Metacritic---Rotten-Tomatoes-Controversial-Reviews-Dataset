Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best\\, behind Empire and Rogue One. Very meaningful movie to me. It was about failure\\, hope\\, finality\\, new beginnings. It was about\\, even when everything has gone wrong and it's your fault\\, we all make mistakes and it's not the end. It's about how we are all good and bad. We can be reckless\\, impulsive\\, trigger happy\\, but can also be full of hope\\, resolve\\, passion\\, and devotion. Amazing movie! Watching it once it's not enough! ","true":true}
