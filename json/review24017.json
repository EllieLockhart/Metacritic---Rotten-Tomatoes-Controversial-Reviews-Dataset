Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mark Hamill did a good job despite being given such a worthless script. Actually\\, I like the actors\\, all of them\\, but the entire movie is awful from beginning to end. I watched The Force Awakens and Rogue One twice in the cinema\\, The Last Jedi once... and after I now recently watched it on blue ray too I feel like I'm probably never gonna watch it again. I feel very sorry for Mark Hamill for what they did to him with this movie.","true":true}
