Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm shocked! I'm freaking shocked!!! I'm torn between a burning hatred towards Rian Johnson and pity. I really can't determine if this terrible film was intentional and a giant FU to fans and cinema or if Rian truly thought it was good?!! I mean how could anyone think that was a good Star Wars let alone a good film?!?! Holy sheeeeet","true":true}
