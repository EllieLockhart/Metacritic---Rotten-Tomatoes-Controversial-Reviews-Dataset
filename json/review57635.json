Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many plot issues. 1) DToo many plot issues. 1) Despite portraying the story otherwise\\, Poe actually saves the Resistance:  Poe destroys the fleet killer dreadnaught\\, only to be demoted for this action.  However\\, if he hadn't done so\\, the Resistance would have been destroyed by the dreadnaught when it came out of light speed. The movie goes out of the way to put Poe in his place\\, but never acknowledges the simple truth that his decisive action prevented the complete annihilation of the Resistance.\\n2). Leia uses the Force.  Somehow Leia can use the force to save herself from the void and vacuum of space\\, but can't be bothered to use the Force to save anybody else.  Selfish . . . but just goes to show that you can drop \\\"princess' but not the privilege.\\n3). Leia must be a military awful leader\\, but she is portrayed with high esteem.  It appears the Resistance suffers nothing but losses under her command.  The only real major victory against the First Order was the doing of Han Solo.  Notice that the rest of the galaxy can't be bothered to respond the Resistance call to fight (even with her portentous insistence that the communication be sent with her personal code).  This shows you what the Galaxy actually thinks of Leia.\\n4) The escape plan is nonsense. You really have to go out of you way to add some silly elements to make this plausible\\, like the First Order wouldn't just immediately destroy the Resistance fleet coming out of the light speed or introducing \\\"cloaking\\\" (are these transports Birds of Prey from Star Trek?).  Plus\\, the escape plan is to paint yourself into a corner in an old\\, defunct base?  And just to rehash Leia's ability to use to Force\\, she is literally just sitting around while the base is under attack (waiting for somebody to come the rescue)-wouldn't it be a good time to demonstrate some of that force ability?\\n5) Final Jump to light speed: I guess we are just supposed to ignore all the discussions of running out of energy\\, and the ship running of fumes. \\nI won't go too far into a helpless Rey being choked out\\, and needing to be saved by Kylo Ren.","true":true}
