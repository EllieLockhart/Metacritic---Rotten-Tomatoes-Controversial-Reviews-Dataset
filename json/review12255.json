Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am not a bot or a troll.  I just did not like that movie.  I could give a list (a long one) of reasons why this movie didn't sit well with me\\, but that has already been done extensively on this website by other reviewers and I agree with most of them.  \\n\\nAmong this movies biggest failures were: Pacing - giving too much time and attention to plots with holes or that go no where.\\nCharacter development: neglecting Rey\\, Finn and Poe and wasting time on new characters that are unlikeable (Rose and Porgs).\\nInconsistencies: It is like this movie forgot it is part of a franchise.  It doesn't behave like a Star Wars movie and fails to connect any dots with past movies and where it could logically go from here.\\n\\nI am very confused how this movie is still holding at 49% audience approval.  It looks to me that for every 5 star review there are at least double the amount of 1\/2 or 1 star reviews.  Something fishy going on with the tomatometer indeed.","true":true}
