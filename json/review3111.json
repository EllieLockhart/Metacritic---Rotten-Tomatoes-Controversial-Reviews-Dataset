Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bad writing. Bad acting. Bad plot. Stupid sub plots. Terrible character development on characters you were supposed to care about. Mary poppins general Organa. Plot holes galore. Killing off some of the mystery of characters such as Snoke. One of the worst of the franchise.","true":true}
