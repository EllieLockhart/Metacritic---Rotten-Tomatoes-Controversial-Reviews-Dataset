Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi breaks all the conventions of good movie making. It is a terrible Star Wars movie and a terrible movie full stop! You don't build up an entire plot line for half the movie and then abandon it completely prior to The Final Act. And that is just one example of the terrible scripting in the last Jedi. There is so much wrong with this movie I could go on forever. How you go from Looper to The Last Jedi\\, I just don't know.","true":true}
