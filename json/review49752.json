Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"WTF!!!!!\\, This movie could have been so much fucking better\\, i love star wars and when this movie was announced i was excited to see one of the best movie heroes  (luke skywalker)  back in action again\\, but instead he's a crotchety old motherfucking coot\\, this whole mother fucking movie is an sjw fuck fest filled with crylo ren\\, leia poppins \\, and MAREY FUCKING SUE i honestly dont know what else to say about this pile of shit that is clearly not star wars that hasnt been said already\\, a much better title for this fuck sjw fest is disney wars the shit jedi\\, i really fucking hate this movie and for this reason since i cant give this piece of shit zero stars im just going to give this shit hole a fucking half star\\, after i saw this film i was done with star wars untill kk and ruin johnson are out of office im fucking done with disneys version of lucsfilm and star wars until they finally get their shit together","true":true}
