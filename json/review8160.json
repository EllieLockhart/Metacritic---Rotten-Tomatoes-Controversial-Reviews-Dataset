Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic movie but not without its flaws. The depth of character that Rian Johnson gives to everyone in this film of great. The visuals are great and the storyline itself isn't perfect but it's good.\\nI can understand some of the dislike with the plot and the Finn storyline but all in all a good movie.\\n\\nWe got a lot of epic scenes and story to dissect as fans.","true":true}
