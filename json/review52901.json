Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great movie. Continues the saga and I look forward to the third movie in this trilogy. FX are excellent. I won't comment on scenes so I won't be a spoiler. A couple could have been deleted w\/o effect and a couple could have been embellished a bit. That's the same with all movies though so who am I to judge.","true":true}
