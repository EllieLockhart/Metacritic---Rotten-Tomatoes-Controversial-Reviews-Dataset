Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Okay\\, so there were things I'd rather not happen in a Star Wars film\\, but TLJ is incredible!  I think any hate is directed at a crucial scene towards the end that people are just going to have to learn to live with.  When the dust settles TLJ will go down as one of the greatest Star Wars \\nFilms ever.","true":true}
