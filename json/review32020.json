Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers - Mastering the Force no longer requires training\\, Finn is no longer a main protagonist  and he repeats the same arc from the previous movie in a plot line that doesn't affect the rest of the movie\\, the main plot makes no sense (Holdo's plan is to hope the FO doesn't look slightly to the right of the ship they are tracking)\\, and they destroyed the only characters that make 9 worth looking forward to.","true":true}
