Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was terrible  and there was no plot and the acters suck sorry to say but Walt Disney  only did this movie for the money that would come in bye the hard core fans and shit all over use what  a pile of garbage  sorry to say","true":true}
