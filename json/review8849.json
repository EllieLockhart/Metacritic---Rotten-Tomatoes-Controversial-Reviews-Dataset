Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For new star wars fans I guess it might be ok but for the vast majority (fans who grew up on the original trilogy) it was very bad. To think your gona see 1 of your childhood heroes back again in a movie like this\\, gona be a Jedi master & kick some ass & stuff but nope.... instead his character is made to dislike the Jedi & be a hermit\\, no fighting or light saber battles. He uses the force once & dies. One positive thing is now I don't care about waiting for episode 9. What a huge disappointment this movie was. Shame on R Johnson for butchering Star Wars.","true":true}
