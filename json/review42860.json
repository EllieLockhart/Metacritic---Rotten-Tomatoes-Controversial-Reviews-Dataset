Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was probably the best thing to come out of Star Wars since the Original Trilogy\\, It was well paced\\, interesting and unpredictable. It may have had too much humor at some points but I mean so does Empire. At least I remember all the characters\u2019 names in this movie unlike Rogue One. ","true":true}
