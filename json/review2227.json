Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A tight race between this an Phantom Menace for the worst of the series. 1\/3rd great with good concepts and could have been a good way to twist the same tired SW story\\, another 1\/3rd that should have been left on the cutting room floor\\, and another 1\/3rd that is the most boring version of the a submarine movie ever produced.","true":true}
