It was to concentrated in vengeance karma choices and missed out the whole point of the first game like did where the virus came from? Is there a cure besides ellie?  I mean it has a lot to been seen. But OK I enjoy it. Of course Joel's death was a little forced\\, serious\\, Joel was a professional smuggler and he knew very well how to stay low.
