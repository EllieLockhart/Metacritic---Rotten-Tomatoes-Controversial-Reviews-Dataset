Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie radically changes everything! I loved it but that is why it is getting mixed reviews from fans. It makes a clean break from the other movies and charts it\u2019s own course. If you love are looking for more of the same old Star Wars\\, you will have a hard time with this movie. If you are excited about new possibilities\\, then you will love it. Search your feelings...trust the Force. ","true":true}
