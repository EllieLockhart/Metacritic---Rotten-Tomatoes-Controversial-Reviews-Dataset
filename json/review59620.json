The story line seemed to continue where the last one left off.... early death of the father figure was both rushed and telegraphed in - and what followed became predictable ......  Its like we need to be told that doing bad stuff is bad mmmkay?  Seriously this game makes got season 8 looks like a masterpiece.  Then it turns into Dexter season finale.\r\rThe force you to play the character that kills Joel - and just force feed you her story...when you already know what happens to everyone in her story.  They try to make you feel back about the things you've already done - and it doesn't work.\r\r30 hours later - I give nearly zero fcks about Abby and her crew.

The last of us 1 - amazing.  This?   We deserve better.  20 hours of playing as a character I don't care about.  They forced\u2026 Expand","true":true}
