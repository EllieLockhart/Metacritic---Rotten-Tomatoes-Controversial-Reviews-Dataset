Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney and Rian Johnson deconstructed the essence of what Star Wars means to so many people and replaced it with a depressing punch to the gut for no reason other than to have something new and novel. It disrespected all continuity that came before it while wrapping itself in a cloak of  Star Wars flavored cynicism while still having the nerve to call itself a Star Wars movie. \\nThe fact they Johnson tried to insert so much inappropriate flat humor in a movie with such a high death toll is shocking. The scenes weren't funny; and even if they were should we be laughing where everyone we are supposed to care about is dying on some level? Ultimately it succeeded in sending the message that everything in Star Wars is trivial except Rian Johnson's nihilistic contribution. Everyone is disposable.\\n I'm not a Buddhist but I think if he was trying to send a non attachment lesson with a Buddhist flavor I would say he completely missed the boat.\\nHe succeeded in sending a very negative message of how to care ( or not care) for those we have grown up with ( ie: all the characters up to this point) and it certainly isn't the kind of message that's consistent to Star Wars.","true":true}
