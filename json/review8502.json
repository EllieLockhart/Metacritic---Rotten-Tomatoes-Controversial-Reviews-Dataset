Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Finn's story arc... Who cares.  The whole casino city was just a way to throw unnecessary cgi into the movie.  Why doesn't the First Order have security cameras anywhere?  No mid range bombers?  Their ships are too slow to catch them?  And ties don't have the range?  Then why not send more than 4 of them out to attack?  You know there are hundreds of them on each of the star destroyers?  So we get to watch a slow boring drawn out space... I don't know survival?  Leia is now super woman?  And how much more can they force that Pie is a wreckl","true":true}
