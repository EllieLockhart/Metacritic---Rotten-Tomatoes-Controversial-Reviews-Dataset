Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"looks like star wars\\, sounds like star wars...not star wars.\\n\\nthere are endless youtube reviews that can categorize all the mountainous issues with this film. plot holes\\, failed opportunities\\, power creep beyond the point of credulity.\\nbest part in the movie\\, r2d2 scene. worst part in the movie; fin and rose on canto bight.\\nsee it once\\, and use your brains. if you don't care about star wars as part of a 1-8 series with a total universe and story arc you'll enjoy this film more then if you do. This film is not bold\\, this film is wishywashy\\, convenient\\, contrived\\, and insulting to the idea of character development and growth. characters are simply whatever the current writer director wanted them to be...\\nthe biggest failing in this movie as with the force awakens is character growth and story telling...more than anything else star wars is moving away from heavy themes of heroism and tragedy and towards Transformers (Micheal bay).","true":true}
