Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know what everyone who is giving shit reviews on this film are on\\, but this installment is phenomenal! The characters\\, both old and new\\, are well written with the level of development and background that I have come to expect from this franchise. It's serious and dark when it needs to be and bright and humorous at just the right moments. Star Wars continues to impress me with the complex\\, but still fluid\\, conflict between the dark side and the light. Highly recommended to go see.","true":true}
