Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"it was an alright movie its just to Disney for me and the Lore is gone and it didnt feel like StarWars :\/ i do think people should see it but to me as a hardcore star wars fan i was let down and the 56% is not trolls its real even people i went to the movie with where kinda upset :\/","true":true}
