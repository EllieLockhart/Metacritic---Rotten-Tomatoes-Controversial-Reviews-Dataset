Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing this movie there's only one thing I could say. JJ. Abrams should have written and directed the entirety of this 3 part story with Rey\\, Finn\\, and the others. Rian Johnson comes in to Star Wars: The Last Jedi with everything on a silver platter. JJ Abrams set up this trilogy perfectly with the force awakens. He gave us an interesting story with great characters to expand the lore of star wars. Everything that Abraham set up in the force awakens is completely burned to the ground by Rian Johnson. The writing in the film is sub par and gives you an inkling that Johnson and the others did not completely understand where they were with the universe and the story. The decisions made in the film are rushed and are made without consideration of the fans\\, which is very clear in some points. Johnson handles important characters without care and will anger many fans. This 8th installment in the main star wars canon will be very divisive. To me\\, Johnson was not the right man for the job and the direction he chooses to go with this film genuinely could have killed this trilogy after a brilliant start. ","true":true}
