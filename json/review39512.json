Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film totally misrepented Star Wars. It's full of plot holes and as a genuine life long Star Wars fan I was not left satified. Real shame. Undone over thirty years of pure George Lucas genius","true":true}
