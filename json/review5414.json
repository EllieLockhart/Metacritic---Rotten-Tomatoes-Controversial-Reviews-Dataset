Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite its nearly three hour running time\\, the film never manages to bite deep into the character relationships that were set up in The Force Awakens. There are many many scenes but the story is never blooms or pays off. Rian Johnson seems more interested in subverting fan expectations for the sake of it\\, rather than developing the characters naturally and actually taking bold risks that sear new paths into the Star Wars mythos. Its beautiful\\, the visuals look very expensive\\, but the story is limp and filled with bad twists and zero character payoffs.","true":true}
