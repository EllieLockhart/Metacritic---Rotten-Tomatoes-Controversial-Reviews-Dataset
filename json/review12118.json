Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a fan of the Star wars saga\\, I watched the first movies as a kid and I still love them. I have no idea what exactly is wrong with the new episodes Lucas produced\\, I think he just used the technology to show the people how he sees the Star Wars universe. But now after he sold the rights and Disney took it over\\, it is with every new episode just worse. :-( What the hell was this Last Jedi???? Luke seemed to have a huge come back and than\\, it was just his soul and he died without any fight??? Who the hell had the idea that the first order would hunt the rebels in the space and they can't catch them??? Man\\, who wrote this\\, a 5 years old kid??? I can understand why Lucas sold Star Wars\\, but this was the biggest fail of his life. It would be better not to see the last three episodes at all\\, as to see this kind of BS. I am maximally disappointed!!","true":true}
