Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was optimistic about this film but\\, they completly missed the mark. Its missing almost everything that made starwars great. There was a way to pay tribute to the original trilogy & go in a new direction but\\, they completly failed at that. There are to many things that are out of  the norm of what the original characters would do & actions they would have normally have taken. Same thing with the \\\"bad guys\\\". Some of the actions they took were unrealistic of competent actions during military conflict Finally\\, the character Luke Skywalker was completly wrong based on the what he has been in previous films. I think that was the biggest mistake. \\n\\nOn another note the movie lacks character development & subplots that are irrelevant to the main story.","true":true}
