Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was just not a good movie. I have no idea why so many critics loved it\\, but i've been a Star wars fan since the late 80's and I did not care for this movie at all.  \\n\\nEvery scene left me scratching my head from the opening scene where a lone x-wing\\, piloted by Poe\\, managed to blow up every single gun battery on a huge first order dreadnaught\\, to the same imperial attack on a rebel base on a snow planet (this time it was salt...sigh)\\, with goofy looking ATATs and awful speeders to boot.  We got to see the \\\"rebellion\\\" go from 400 members to about a dozen by the end of the movie.   What Rebellion?  Kylo was still his terrible whiney self.  I think he is the worst Dark side bad guy through 8 movies\\, and somehow\\, what little light saber choreography there was in the movie\\, was just bad.  I hated the prequels but one thing that they nailed was the light saber duels.  \\n\\nAt this point\\, I've nearly lost all interest in Disney's vision of Star Wars\\, which is sad because I had such high hopes\\, and while I didn't love the force awakens\\, I felt it was a step in the right direction\\, but after rogue one\\, and now the last jedi\\, I don't care if i see any more or not.","true":true}
