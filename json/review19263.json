Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's not a terrible movie because it's bad\\, it's because it has so many flaws in the plotline\\, characters and story: some of it is mildly cringeworthy (the contrived humour and forced banter)\\, some of it a slap in the face to Star War fans (killing off key characters without the due respect\\, and leaving so much unanswered). The critics are clearly off on this one\\, as the early reviews raved about it\\, but over the first week\\, the Audience Score dropped from 90% to 54% as I'm writing this\\, which is a little less than the 'movie' as a whole deserves (I'd say 75-80%)\\, but is exactly what the screenwriters deserve for treating its fans with this level of contempt and indifference. Better on the second viewing\\, but only due to that fact you're mentally prepared and better ignore the bad bits.","true":true}
