Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"don't understand the hate - fantastic movie and then refreshing that they added to the legend of Star Wars rather then just rehasing same old ideas and story lines like they did with Force Awakens.
