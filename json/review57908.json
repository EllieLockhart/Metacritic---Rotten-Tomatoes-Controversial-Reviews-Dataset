Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What an utter disappointment this movie was.  I honestly left the theater actually upset by what these new people did to my beloved franchise.  This latest installment of Star Wars has the most pointless plot\\, giant plot holes\\, ridiculous humor\\, cheesy scenes and annyoing new characters (I'm looking at you\\, Rose).  \\n\\nPlease\\, Disney\\, restore our original story here.  The Force Awakens laid groundwork for a great story to be told and you took a match to it.  I am saddened to say this after spending 44 years of my life invested in this galaxy far\\, far away\\, but I think I am done with Star Wars.","true":true}
