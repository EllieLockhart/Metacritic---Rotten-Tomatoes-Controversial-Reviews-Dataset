Last of us part 2 undid what the first one accomplished: good story\\, excellent character development\\, a father\/daughter relationship between Joel and Ellie. Keep in mind I did see the leaks and I knew how the story would go but it's totally different seeing it play out. Some of thing I will say people will not agree with but keep in mind this is just a game and not real life. As soon as abby killed Joel I was mad and filled with rage. Soon as I started my journey for revenge you have no idea how bad I wanted to make abby suffer. Soon as we do confront abby as ellie that's where things went downhill for me. We play as abby for what felt like forever. Just for the heck of it I just let her fall off a ledge or let the infected have their way with her. I even let ellie kill her multiple times. Yes\\, you have to fight ellie as abby and that is not cool. Like many of you out there I didnt care about abby or why she killed Joel. Soon as she killed Joel I wanted her dead. Going back to ellie\\, there are times where she becomes dark like when she killed nora. You have no idea how satisfying that was for me. Or when she killed mel. Ellie only defended herself and she had no idea mel was pregnant but that didnt phase me. Her fault for attacking ellie in the first place. I felt no guilt in killing dogs who were trying to kill me. Kill or be killed. For the most part this game is my element.  However it was all ruined in the final part. You get to fight abby as ellie and she let her go. I killed all these people with no hesitation and I can't kill the one person that started this journey of mine. Story should have ended when you saw them at the farm.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
