{"101487":165009,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-08","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson attempts to bring drastic change to Star Wars by subverting our expectations to the point of borderline offensiveness. While at some points the plot and characters progress well\\, the majority of logically progressing plot lines and characters take a backseat to a need to change and progress past the classic fundamentals that make Star Wars Star Wars.  For the moments this film looks stunning visually\\, there are bland\\, poorly lit and animated space battles.  For every Poe Dameron who has a cohesive arc\\, there's a Fin\\, who essentially has the same arc he had in his pervious film (only this time\\, while progressing an unessential\\, bland story). Mark Hamill is at his best as Luke Skywalker in this film.  Luke feels like the same character\\, but with 30 years of struggle and failure on his back.  The best acting we see from Mark comes in his reuniting with R2D2 on the Falcon\\, where the 19 year old farm boy peeks through and we see the same childish excitement we all know him for.  However\\, Luke's climactic moment and death at the end of the film falls short by a mile\\, as his force projection left fans so distracted and confused that when he died (offhandedly and lazily)\\, there was barely any time to react.  I understand that this film wrapped before the untimely death of Carrie Fisher\\, who was absolutely charming in this film\\, but it feels like a no brainer to keep Luke alive into episode IX if you know you won't have General Leia in your cast.  Unlike most fans\\, I'm onboard with the killing of Snoke without developing him at all because it puts more focus on Kylo Ren as a villain.  I'm also onboard with Rey's parents having no significance\\, because the contrast that we have between a high prestige comes-from-royalty Ben Solo and a comes-from-nothing scavenger Rey creates an interesting dynamic.  This film left me with Rey's character exactly where I feel we left her in The Force Awakens: without training\\, so powerful that the stakes constantly feel low\\, and without a true path. This film felt like the longest Star Wars film without the payoff or development it should have had.  Yet\\, somehow\\, it feels like it wrapped up the story\\, albeit poorly\\, and now there's nowhere to go.  I walked out of this movie on opening night absolutely silent. I couldn't fathom the idea of not liking a Star Wars film. Rian Johnson has come out and said that this movie was about teaching people to let go of their preconceptions about Star Wars and prepare for it to move forward.  While it definitely didn't move forward\\, instead opting to shamelessly dismantle the saga's most interesting characters and plot threads so we could get a Rian Johnson film\\, it taught me that it's OKAY for me to not like a Star Wars film.  After weeks of contemplation and two more screenings\\, I'm finally comfortable with saying I absolutely hate this movie\\, and that's okay.  So thanks for that\\, I suppose.  Let's just hope JJ Abrahams is able to come in for Episode IX and fix the mess Rian Johnson made of this trilogy.","true":true}
