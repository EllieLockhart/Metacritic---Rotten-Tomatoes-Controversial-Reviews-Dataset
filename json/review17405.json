Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw one of the other reviews saying he's been monitoring the reviews for months and all good reviews are paid for by Disney. What kind of lunatic reads reviews for months and gets so mad about the write another fake review? Who is paying you?\\n\\nBTW This film is amazing!","true":true}
