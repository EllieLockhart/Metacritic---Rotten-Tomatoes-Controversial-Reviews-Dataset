Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Film franchises are supposed to evolve and change over time-- The Last Jedi keeps up by injecting a newness into the Star Wars universe that was highly needed. Think outside the conventions that you have placed Star Wars films to be and enter expecting nothing but a good time.","true":true}
