Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The visuals were amazing and there were some nice surprises in the movie. However\\, the surprises don't hold their appeal into the second viewing for obvious reasons and the rose-tinted glasses also came off revealing all the cons I had forced myself to overlook in the first viewing. As someone who loves Star Wars and has invested 100s of hours and over a $1500 into the franchise I can tell you this\\, if you want to watch Star Wars you should find a different movie as this abomination doesn't deserve to stand with the rest of Star Wars video canon. Anything else to say about the movie would be even more negative. I would rate this lower but I don't want RT to censor my voice by claiming my rating is an outlier so it's getting 1.5.","true":true}
