Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really disappointed supposed fans are making Star Wars political?? I didn\u2019t even notice all the social justice crap I\u2019m hearing about\\, I got lost in the story like I did as a kid watching the originals. This was great story telling\\, action\\, and a few unexpected turns. My kids all teens could care less about the political and loved the movie. Save the political stuff and leave Star Wars alone fans\\, it\u2019s an easy film to love.","true":true}
