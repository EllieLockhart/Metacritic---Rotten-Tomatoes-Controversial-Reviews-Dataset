Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yes it was an awful Star Wars movie but more than that it's just a really terrible movie. Awful dialogue and characters that behave in nonsensical ways at almost every turn. I found myself constantly waiting for a big reveal with each character that would explain why they would do one thing or another and it never came. The characters in this movie exist only to further plot points in a very shallow story.","true":true}
