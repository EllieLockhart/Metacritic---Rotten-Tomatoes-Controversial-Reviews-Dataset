Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars film since Attack of the Clones. I haven't been this upset with a movie since Indiana Jones Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. To say disappointing would be an understatement. I've been a Star Wars fan all my life and I even liked Force Awakens\\, but this ruined the new Trilogy for me. This was a useless movie that tied up no lose ends. I would say more but I'm afraid I might die of exhaustion... #LukeDeservedBetter","true":true}
