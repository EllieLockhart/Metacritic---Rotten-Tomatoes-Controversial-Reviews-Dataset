Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Felt like a Disney film\\, cheesy lines\\, slapstick humor during intense scenes. Throws away all the anticipation from TFA\\, no back story on Snoke. Rey is a nobody and is somehow this amazing force user\\, and now they are saying Jedi\/Sith are done and everyone can be a force user - that is so lame. Stick to the original plot from the first 7 movies. Very disappointed.","true":true}
