Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoiler Alert:  Luke Skywalker is a bitter\\, grumpy old man who could care less about the Rebel Alliance\\, the world or the universe.  It's unbelievable what this director did to the character of Luke Skywalker.  All the mystery surrounding Snoke and Rey - gone.  There are know twist\\, turns or emotion in this compost pile of a movie.  We also learned that a Mega Star Destroyer and its fleet cant fly fast fast enough to take out a small transport ship and has to wait until it it runs out of fuel.  The First Order (Empire) also apparently has trouble blasting open large metal doors blocking a cave entrance.  They actually have to bring in a cannon and sloooooly drag it so that it is within range of the door.  Its amazing how they can jump to light speed\\, and build planet destroying DeathStars but can't knock out a door or even drop the cannon close enough to it....  I give this 2 stars because 1 star is reserved for unwatchable garbage.  this movie will entertain lukewarm fans (pun intended)\\, and Kylo Ren is fun to watch\\, especially when he throws a temper tantrum.","true":true}
