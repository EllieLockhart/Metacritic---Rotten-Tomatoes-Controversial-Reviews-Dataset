Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie has flaws but it has a good movie. I don't get all the hate. Honestly\\, anyone that truly believes this is the worst star wars\\, worse than the garbage that was Phantom Menace\\, is no star wars fan. I understand why some people don't like it and why some people do but to say it's the worst star wars is ridiculous.","true":true}
