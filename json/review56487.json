Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The final third of \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" is what saves it from being a disappointment. I feel the first two-thirds of the movie suffer from major pacing issues. This is primarily due to a subplot that is way out of place and is not in the least bit compelling. Those who have seen the film likely know what I am referring to. However\\, as a whole\\, this is a solid movie that I\\, as a huge \\\"Star Wars\\\" fan\\, thoroughly enjoyed. Most of the action scenes are tension-filled\u00a0and a lot of fun and the movie has an emotional center. There are twists and turns the whole way through and I don't think there is another movie in this series I can compare it to\\, so I give it many props for being something different. All members of the cast do a good job as far as performances go. They go directions with certain characters that are a bit unpredictable but it mostly works. The movie is also a visual treat and showcases some stellar effects and great directing. I did find myself checking my watch in certain parts in the first half\\, and I was upset at this at first\\, but the movie wraps up very nicely. There have been better movies in this series before\\, but there also have been worse. It's a solid addition that personally has me very excited about what's to come in the next part. Ultimately is a very good movie that falls short of being great due to some storytelling choices.","true":true}
