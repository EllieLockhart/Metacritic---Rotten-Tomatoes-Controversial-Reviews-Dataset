Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wouldn't be exaggerating too much to say that the Last Jedi is not only the worst SW movie\\, but a strong contender for worst movie I've ever seen. Storyline was meaningless - containing giant plot holes and an overall forced set of consequences that don't even seem particularly daunting while watching it. Dialogue was incredibly lazy with flat out failed attempts at humour happening all throughout the show. Character development - nonexistent. Overall an outright waste of 2.5 hours - had I not been watching it in a plush VIP screening while eating dinner throughout the movie I am confident I would have left the cinema early. I thought SW hit rock bottom with the Force Awakens' attempt to clone a New Hope\\, and so came into this movie with the lowest possible expectations (and an open mind)\\, but this movie proves that it can plumb even greater depths of cinematic excrement previously unimaginable to the viewer. 0.5 stars only because there is no option to give it 0 - a score which I think is extremely fitting for this wreck of a movie. Jeez.","true":true}
