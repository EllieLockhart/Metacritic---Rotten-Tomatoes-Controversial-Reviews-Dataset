Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointed. Definitely different than any other Star Wars but not in a good way. What has happened to story telling anymore. Was there a plan for this trilogy at all? I honestly don't care about a single character. Kylo was interesting but not anymore. Finn\\, Poe\\, Phasma\\, Snope etc are all utterly pointless characters. This trilogy kills all the room for imagination the original had.","true":true}
