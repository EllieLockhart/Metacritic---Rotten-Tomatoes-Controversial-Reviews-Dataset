Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars has cared far too much about what it's fans think since Return of The Jedi. In the prequels\\, they constantly tried to figure out what would please fans but failed. With Force Awakens\\, they tried to figure it out and please thousands\\, but ended up with a very little payoff. At last Star Wars has taken huge risks and brought back why we fell in love with the nobodies from the original films all over again. I eagerly await seeing it again.","true":true}
