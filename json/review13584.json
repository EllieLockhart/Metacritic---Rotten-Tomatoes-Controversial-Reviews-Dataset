Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I felt it was poorly written. Many things were just forcedly pushed into the movie and many things disappeared. Some personages were superficial and unnecessarily and some part of the movies (read all finn's part) leaded nowhere. But the most damaging for the trilogy is that everything previously built on 'The force awakens' was discarded\\, forgot or badly used. It felt like the director didn't agree with the last movie and decided to start it again from scratch. Furthermore\\, it is basically a movie with starwars characters\\, but not a starwars movie. There are now 4 days since I saw the movie and I'm still sad for how poorly written it was.","true":true}
