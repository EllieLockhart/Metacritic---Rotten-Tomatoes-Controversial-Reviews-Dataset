Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A couple of cool scenes can't save this terrible movie.  Too many plot holes.  (I won't include spoilers).  This movie unravels the saga for no reason\\, and the writers pretty much stole the story from 1978's \\\"Battlestar Galactica\\\".  I wish there was a way to fix this thing\\, but sadly there isn't.  All we can do is pretend that it never happened\\, and move on.","true":true}
