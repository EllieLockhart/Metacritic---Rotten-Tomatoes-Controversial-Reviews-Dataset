Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Originally gave it 5 star. But then re watched the original trilogy and realized how forced the humour was and how bad Luke is written by Rian Johnson. Not to mention Rey's parents\\, Rose\\, flying Leia\\, Canto Bite\\, and Phasma dying. I gave it 3 stars for the throne room fight\\, how good Kylo Ren and Rey are in this film and Master Yoda returning. I really wish JJ Abrams made this one. Would have been a whole lot better.","true":true}
