Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"I felt a great disturbance in the Force\\, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced \\\" those voices were starwars fans. review  plot a movie about running out of fuel\\, if you jump to light speed you will be tracked. mission to turn of switch so you can escape snokes ship send fin and rose realy?  Then reys has no memory of her force vision and can't be trained by luke because hes now merlin from sword in the stone \\\"disney\\\". leia becomes space mary poppins \\, fin rose love story sucked. kylo can't make up his mind. luke becomes holigram the end. I would need a long time to write the full story so bloody long with more plot holes and bad acting like soap star rey.what happened to rey. The were good  bit was yoda \\,chewie- luke R2-luke  kylo killing snoke-  rey kylo killing guards but.yeah but  worst movie of year. just hope i dont run out of fuel unless i'm just near a secret rebel base.","true":true}
