Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I know why many don\u2019t like the film. This isn\u2019t the hero\u2019s journey we wanted for Luke. I\u2019m still disappointed we aren\u2019t getting films starring the Solo and Skywalker children from the extended universe. But it\u2019s still a solid film. ","true":true}
