Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm surprised by the amount of bad reviews this movie is getting! Personally\\, I thought it was a great movie\\, definitely in the top 3 of the saga.\\nI think some people just had so many expectations for how the story should go and it's not be possible to please everyone. Definitely the movie has a different vibe from the other ones\\, more focused on character development and setting the stage for Episode IX.\\nI really enjoyed the twists and surprises\\, some of which I was not expecting at all. Try not to read spoilers before the movie\\, it really is worth it to watch without knowing what's gonna happen.\\nOne of the flaws is that I wished some characters had more to do (i.e. Phasma and Maz)\\, however\\, for the main characters (Luke\\, Leia\\, Rey and Kylo\/Ben) I think the plot went into really interesting places that left me excited for the conclusion of the trilogy.\\nKudos to Mark\\, Carrie (forever our badass princess\/general)\\, Daisy and Adam\\, they really carried the movie for me.\\nWorth a second (and maybe third?) viewing to really grasp all that is going on and... for the haters... maybe see it without the burden of huge expectations.","true":true}
