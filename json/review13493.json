Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I fear for this franchises. They undid everything they built in episode 7. I'm not really looking forward to episode 9 at all. Visually it was amazing but the story was so bad. Very clearly thus film is out to make money not to make sense.","true":true}
