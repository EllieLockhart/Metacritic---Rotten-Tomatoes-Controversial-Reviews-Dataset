Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a slap in the face to Star Wars fans and lore. Everything built up by The Force Awakens was thrown away in The Last Jedi without caution. It was director Rian Johnson playing with Star Wars toys with a plot foolishly slapped together and at most times unnecessary. Poor character development and poor humor. Cringe worthy.","true":true}
