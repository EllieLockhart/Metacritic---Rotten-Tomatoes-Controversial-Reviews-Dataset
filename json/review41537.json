Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is different than any of the other recent installments. It's a thinker\\, with multiple plotlines to follow. Although some moments were not my favorite\\, they were far outweighed by the things I Loved. It's not a easy watch and you may have to mull it over for a bit. Definitely geared more toward star wars fans instead of the casual movie goer. I loved it!","true":true}
