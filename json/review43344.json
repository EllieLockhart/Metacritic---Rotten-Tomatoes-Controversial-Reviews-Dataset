Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a mess of a movie. Space action was great\\, other than that movie veered of in so many strange directions it really did not feel like a star wars movie. The long\\, slow spaceship chase scene is just one example of where the movie was ridiculous. Really wanted to love this movie but can\u2019t. Waiting for the Han Solo stand-alone move next year I guess. ","true":true}
