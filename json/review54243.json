{"101487":132809,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-22","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you\u2019re thinking of watching the new Star Wars: The Last Jedi then you should. It is a good movie but not great. It has some great moments\\, however\\, also some weak moments that begs you to ask the question\\, \u201cIs this a comedy?\u201d For example the first time you see Finn\\, who was in a coma from the last movie \\, The Force Awakens\\, he falls off his bed in a weak attempt at comedy. When it comes to action and comedy Marvel\u2019s The Avengers and the new Thor movie hit the nail on the head. The Last Jedi has a few funny moments\\, other attempts at jokes wil have you asking\\, why? With that being said\\, there are some great moments! Epic fight\\, scenes most notably against Supreme Leader Snoke\u2019s body guards are a kung-fu sci-fi delight! As always special-effects and cinematography are beautiful and make the movie a hit. Cool new characters: Admiral Amilyn Holdo played by Laura Dern and most likable Rose Tico played by Kelly Marie Tran\\, first major asian character in Star Wars universe\\, brings some new life to the scenes. The new characters also continues a great theme of the new Star Wars movies of showcasing \u201cstrong female characters\u201d. Benicio Del Torro performance as a hacker and codebreaker also brings some charm to the screen reminiscent of Biily Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian. (The Empire Strikes Back) One of the most powerful moments deal with the late Carrie Fisher who plays Princess Leia. Just seeing Princess Leia fight for her life with a matured grace and strength is heart wrenching and moving. All in all this movie continues a great legacy of expanding \u201ca galaxy far\\, far away\u201d. The return of Luke Skywaker and his powers\\, and flaws\\, as a Jedi Master are both troubling and cerebrated\\, including getting some help from a Star Wars\u2019 legend\\, which will go unnamed due to major spoiler. The power of art and fiction is about inspiring moments that deal with real life. One of the great accomplishments of the latest Star Wars movies is the subtle way of showing sacrifices made in war including unknown heroes. One of the lasting moments for me is a quote by Rose Tico\\, who throughout the movie helps Finn redeem himself as a rebel by reminding him (and the audience) about our focus in real life fights of today. \u201cThe Resistance won\u2019t win by fighting the things they hate- they will win by saving what they love.\u201d I give Star Wars: The Last Jedi 4.5 Fists out of 5. \u270a\ud83c\udffe\u270a\ud83c\udffe\u270a\ud83c\udffe\u270a\ud83c\udffe\ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffe \u201cMay the Force Be With You\u2026Always\u201d review by Tem Blessed #starwars #thelastjedi #thelastjedireview #starwarsreview #temblessed","true":true}
