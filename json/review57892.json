Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a disappointing mess. The Force Awakens set this movie up to be brilliant but it failed dismally. The director has assassinated beloved characters in the worst way possible and the one character not killed off (sleep well Carrie Fisher) has now passed away. \\nA canon specialist could have easily pointed out the plot holes which are littered throughout the movie and disguised with the pacing meaning you dont really get time to process the plot hole before you are given something else to think about. Scenes were scandalously lifted from The Empire Strikes back\\, even the exact script was stolen and recycled. I come away from this movie not caring about characters I should and hating the  characters I shouldn't. The movie villains are incompetent buffoons and totally unbeleivable. Much of the tension build up in scenes was spolied by stupid jokes.\\nEasily the worst Star Wars film made to date with canon being contradicted actually rendering the previous trilogies pointless.\\nI am not interested in Episode 9 due to the poor writing and inconsistant story telling so far.","true":true}
