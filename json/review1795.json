Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a star wars movie this was terrible\\, canon destroying in many ways.\\nNot much better as a stand alone movie\\, too much of the narrative just didn't make sense. Spent too much time clumsily force feeding politics to me\\, which constantly jarred me out of the story. \\nVisually stunning across the piece earns 1 star back.","true":true}
