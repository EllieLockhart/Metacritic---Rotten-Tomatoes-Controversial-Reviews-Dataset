Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good points: effects\\, visuals\\, music - normal for a Star Wars movie.\\n\\nBad points: plot\\, simplistic characterization - not unusual for a Star Wars movie.\\n\\nMore bad points: men are stupid\\, only plans crafted by women can succeed\\, white men are the evil empire\\, women and minorities are the rebels\\, everything that came before must be minimized and tarnished.  There was too much underlying propaganda.  It was noticeable throughout the entire film and repeatedly took me out of enjoying it.  Mark Hamill's initial response was correct - what they did to Luke was inconsistent with what came before - he was another white male who had to be taken out of the way and made to look like a fool.\\n\\nIf you're going to shove a social agenda\\, at least be more subtle and have a decent plot to go with it.  There's a reason the critics love this film and simultaneously the people do not.","true":true}
