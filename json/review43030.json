Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was way better than The Force Awakens in my books. The only downfall of this movie was the 20 minutes or so of plot that didn\u2019t need to be in the movie. And if you are trying to figure that plot out\\, it\u2019s the scenes in the movie that kind of reverted back to the prequel era (casino planet). The rest of the movie though was solid. I\u2019d put this #3 on the list behind A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back. ","true":true}
