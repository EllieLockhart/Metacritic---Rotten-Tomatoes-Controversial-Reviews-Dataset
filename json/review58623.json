We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I was also one of the players who thoroughly enjoyed the first game. After waiting 6 years for the sequel\\, I cannot emphasise how disappointed I was. Killing Joel was a huge disrespect to his character and does not make any logical sense. In the first game\\, he could sense an ambush from a mile away and in this game\\, he must have become retarded as he follows a group of strangers and identifies himself. The characters are what made me fall in love with the first game personally and to see Joel die in such an unsatisfying way kills me. Apart from Joel\\, Ellie does not grow in any meaningful way in the second game either. She is just mindlessly driven for blood and in the end\\, she kills\r\reveryone\r\rexcept the one person who was soley responsible for Joel's death. (Abby). In addition to that\\, the game does not offer the experience of progression and the stories between the two characters are so haphazardly arranged\\, going back and forth that there is no sense of going forward and progressing. I do not mind if the characters are lesbian or transgender but to have a random character appear out of nowhere and kill one of the most beloved characters...\r\rThe positive reviews are people that had no sense of attachment to the original title. This whole game is just a message that revenge is bad. The graphics\\, the mechanics and audio are all beyond fantastic but it's a story game and Naughty Dog **** up on the story. Save your money do not buy this game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
