Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a paradox. It is not a 'meh' movie because there is 'good' in it however it is not a good movie because there is a lot of bad in here. Rey is a Mary Sue\\, Luke's character gets assassinated\\, Admiral Holdo and Rose are terrible additions to the Star Wars franchise\\, the only good characters in this movie are Leia (R.I.P Carrie Fisher) and Kylo Ren. This single-handedly broke Star Wars. ","true":true}
