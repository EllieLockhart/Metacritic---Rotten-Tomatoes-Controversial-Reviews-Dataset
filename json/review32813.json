Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars will always make money because its Star Wars. Everyone should go see it and make their own opinion. I would recommend saving your money and waiting till it comes out on redbox. I honestly enjoyed Justice League more than this. They plot was weak\\, they really dropped the ball on most of the characters. There is no development on the new characters at all. The forced humor doesn't fit. It is funny\\, but it is definitely out of place. Disney is trying to hard to make the new characters the original cast instead of being new and fresh.  That said it is Star Wars so go into it with lowered expectations and you will probably enjoy it for what it is.","true":true}
