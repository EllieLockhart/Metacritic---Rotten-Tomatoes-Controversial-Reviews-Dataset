Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie. I have loved star wars since seeing ROTJ at 3 years old. They changed a lot\\, but it still feels like Star Wars. I like the change of pace personally. I plan on seeing this multiple times.","true":true}
