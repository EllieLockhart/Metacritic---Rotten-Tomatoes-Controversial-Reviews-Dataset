Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's not an 80s Star Wars story done in today's style\\, it's a present day Star Wars story done present day style.\\nThe Force Awakens was a shining example of the former\\, to wonderful effect\\, which I completely enjoyed.  But The Last Jedi finally shows that Star Wars can thrive without being married to the old formula\\, the way modern TV breaks all of the old archetypes\\, and is more interesting for it.","true":true}
