Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie and I will return to it many times. It was especially important to me to see the full range of female characters present in the movie\\, each with their own characteristics and important story line. Rey's story especially really resonated with my in this movie--even more so than in The Force Awakens. It was fantastic to see her come to terms with her identity and express real emotions\\, all while kicking butt! the movie gave me a lot of things I had been wanting since seeing EP7\\, but it also gave a lot of shocks and crazy twists. The Last Jedi has some of the greatest cinematic moments I've ever seen (seriously\\, that kamikaze attack toward the end!) Absolutely recommend seeing The Last Jedi.","true":true}
