Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst Star Wars Movie to date. If you were expecting any character continuity\\, even from the newly introduced characters\\, look elsewhere or for a major retcon. \\nThe only good parts of it for me were Mark Hamill's performance despite how horribly the writing was for a very beloved character\\, Luke Skywalker. Far too many elements or the film either make no sense in the universe or were just plain bad.\\nThe solo star I give is to Mark Hamill and not to the film as I would give it a 0\/5 if possible.","true":true}
