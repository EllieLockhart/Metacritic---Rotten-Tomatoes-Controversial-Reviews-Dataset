Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was just a poor movie (all star wars inconsistencies aside). Side plots that go nowhere and have no significance to the story\\, an absurd amount of weird \\\"jokes\\\" that seemed inappropriate considering the situation\\, and a bunch of useless characters that felt very much like \\\"celebrities that wanted to be in the new star wars\\, so give them a part\\\". Definitely not recommended and will not see again. I recommend a do-over.","true":true}
