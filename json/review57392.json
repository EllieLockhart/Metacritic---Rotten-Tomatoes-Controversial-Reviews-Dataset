Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie takes everything that TFA sets up and completely throws it out the window\\, but not in a good way. Everything we were excited about from the previous installment was answered in the most disappointing ways imaginable. Story had so many plot holes\\, and broke a number of its own rules. Portrayal of majority of characters was inconsistent with previous installments\\, which produced a very jarring effect considering this film takes place just a few hours after the previous movie's events. The story-line chosen for Luke's character was a major slap in the face to all fans that had grown up with his character being their first heroic model in a Sci-Fi\/Fantasy movie. Finn\/Rose story-line was awful from the first scene till the last\\, bringing many cringe worthy moments\\, some hilariously unsubtle modern political messaging\\, and the single dumbest moment in a Star Wars movie ever. If this entire sub-plot (which was ultimately pointless) was removed from the movie\\, my score would most likely be at least 1 Star higher. Rey continues to face zero real conflict\\, and fails at absolutely nothing she attempts. The overall message of this movie is that sometimes heroes \\\"fail\\\"\\, yet Rey is widely successful at everything she does\\, including once again besting Kylo (he wasn't injured this time!). I gave the film two stars purely for the incredible special effects and a good musical score.","true":true}
