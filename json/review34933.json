Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film is technically put together at an average level for your typical superhero blockbuster film.  However\\, as with The Force Awakens\\, the lack of creativity and the generic filmmaking techniques employed in telling a story that does an absolute disservice to the source content is absolutely undeserving of the title Star Wars.","true":true}
