Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hope a second viewing will redeem the movie for me\\, but as of right now\\, I'm really disappointed. I'm a die-hard fan\\, but I did go into this film with an open mind. I knew if I had too many expectations\\, I'd be let down. Yet I was still massively let down by this film. The plot was weak\\, with a ton of holes that had me scratching my head. So many things The Force Awakens set up were thrown in the trash can by The Last Jedi...what was the point? What was the point of any of this? I was optimistic about Disney taking over Star Wars\\, but now I fear they've gone into full Disney territory -\u00a0selling toys of cute aliens\\, corny dialogue and giving us \\\"plot twists\\\" just for the sake of \\\"surprising us\\\" -\u00a0it all felt hollow and void of what I've grown up knowing Star Wars to be. I'm not excited for Episode 9\\, and I don't even know if I'm excited for Solo. It's not a good day for this Star Wars fan. I'll go again this Christmas with my family\\, and I hope I can walk away a bit more impressed.","true":true}
