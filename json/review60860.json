Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"So sad of how bad this game-sequel turned to be.

This empty yet frustrated feeling it leaves you with\\, it is just damn painful. The first game was one the most loved games i have ever played and one the few times the story that  experienced touched me so much i a game. This sequel is just cheap. Yes\\, there are some good elements that should not be ignored. The graphics are unbelievably real and the gameplay consists of some enjoyable parts. The music is also nice. Having said that\\, i think the biggest percentage of the people who waited for this  sequel\\, wanted it mostly for the story. This is where i am biased and although if someone rates the game separately\\, meaning graphics 10\/10\\, music 7\/10\\, gameplay 7\/10\\, story 1\/10\\, it won't get a 2. But given of how disappointed i am from the story and the fact that i waited for so long for this\\, i really can not give this game more than 2. Unfortunately\\, the creators and everyone around it will say that most reviews are bad because the don't believe in diversity and stuff like that\\, but everyone of them seems to forget that the DLC in the first game had already told us that Ellie is lesbian and 99% of the gamers did not seemed bothered at all. Diversity is not the problem\\, using diversity in order to make a game relevant and edgy is the problem. P.S. Joel will always be one of my favorite game characters next to Nathan Drake and Arthur Morgan!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
