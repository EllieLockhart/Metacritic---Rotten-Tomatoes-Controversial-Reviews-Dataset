Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie in sense of complexity is good and bit better then Force Awakens.It is good  but its not typical Star Wars movie.It destroys completly view on previous way characters were introduced and loved by fans.It has agenda on putting many characters that brings nothing in the movie.Ryan Johnson seem to not listen to fans of movie frenchise at all rather picture story of company and not his own.Its good movie for one time to see.","true":true}
