Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"while i enjoyed most of the film.i found leia flying a joke and that casino scene is terrible\\,also the first order now seems to be a joke which carries no threat whatso ever with it\\,snoke dead\\,poor use of lukes character\\,this film is a long way from the excellent rogue one.","true":true}
