Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Original trilogy is treated horribly. Luke was a character built up over 6 films and it tore him down. I didnt show his reaction to an important death from the prior film. His Charater tries to redeem his father (the galaxies most evil person) and never gives up. But he does the opposite in this film\\, never attempting redemption of his family member that went wrong. \\n\\nMost of the other Charaters arcs are not much changed from the start of the movie. The universe is small because its a (war) of a couple people in a space chase. The new aliens are all similar along with the ships being similar to the old trillogy\\, its not very creative. \\n\\nHad good visuals.","true":true}
