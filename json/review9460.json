Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Gonna go down as the last great Star Wars film\\, marred mostly be scam Youtubers begging for clicks. I know most will say \\\"It's not flawless...\\\" but forget that. If people want to give it 1 Star for treating Luke like a human being instead of some EU god who could use the dark and lightside of the force at will\\, I don't need to bother explaining. For certain the throne room scene is the greatest in the entire Star Wars saga.","true":true}
