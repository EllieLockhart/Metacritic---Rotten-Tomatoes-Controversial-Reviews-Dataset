Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Oh the script - it needed another go\\,.. Vapid romance sequences that didn\u2019t drive the story forward. Writing and new casting that was just trying to tick every box but the one that demanded a better narrative. Ham acting where decent actors were given such poor direction that it descended into either caricature or melodrama. Not enough heart or action for my liking. And I will never ever forgive whoever sanctioned the Yoda moment. Whoever you are\\, hang your head in shame!","true":true}
