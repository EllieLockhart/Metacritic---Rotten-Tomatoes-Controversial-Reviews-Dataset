Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How on earth does this have 91%? as a standalone movie it's pretty terrible\\, as a Star Wars film it's an utter disgrace!\\n\\nAfter really enjoying both The force awakens and rogue one I was excited to see this. The trilogy was set up nicely and various interesting plots were materialising. The way the story was going and the quality of the last 2 films was promising to say the least.\\n\\n The Last Jedi is so bad in terms of plot and the wider stars wars story that it would be better if they just hadn't bothered. There are plenty of reviews that pick apart the problems... lukes character becoming a joke\\, leia doing a dead space float thing\\, likely the slowest chase in cinemtic history\\, story lines and conflicts between characters within the move that were pointless and easily avoidible and the anticlimatic evaporation of all of TFA story lines.","true":true}
