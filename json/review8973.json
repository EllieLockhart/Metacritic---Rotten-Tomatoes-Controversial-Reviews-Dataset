Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From someone who's seen all of them in the theater\\, this is easily the worst Star Wars movie yet.  It's an agenda movie\\, written and directed with the sole purpose of literally changing everything and attacking every criticism of TFA and Star Wars in general in order to appeal to critics.  TFA copied Ep4?  This copies 5 and 6 together while changing eveything solely for that purpose even though it it breaks story logic and character motivation.  It truly is a broken movie that achieves critical success by taking a red marker to the concepts that \\\"modern audiences\\\" find quaint about the originals\\, focusing bluntly on current affairs politics and presenting it under the star Wars banner; what Lucas originally created \\\"a story of good versus evil for 12 year old boys\\\" and Disney uses as a 2.5 hour toy commercial.","true":true}
