Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi (TLJ) was another excellent chapter in the continuing saga of Star Wars and one I will not soon forget. Taking place right after The Force Awakens (TFA)\\, TLJ feels almost like the second half to the story started in TFA. You could watch them back-to-back and have a complete story with an excellent and fulfilling resolution. While I was surprised by the amount of humor in the film compared to recent Star Wars movies\\, I was not disappointed to have it included. The story of Rey and Kylo is definitely the highlight (at least for me) of this film. They share a connection\\, not unlike Luke and Leia's\\, that begs for a more in depth look. While most people are complaining that TLJ is completely throwing out Star Wars lore\\, I would argue to say that the saga is evolving into something both familiar and unexplored. It will be interesting to see how Episode IX concludes this sequel trilogy and whether or not J.J. Abrams will continue with the idea that Rian Johnson has started. If you are still unsure of the movie\\, ignore what I am saying and what everyone else is saying\\, go see the movie and decide for yourself.","true":true}
