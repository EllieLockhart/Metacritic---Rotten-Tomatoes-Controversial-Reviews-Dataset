Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's entertaining\\, but the movie has a weak story spine\\, and lacks focus. Has too much going to the point where there isn't enough time for believable character development and motives for anyone. Should have made Rey's story arc the central driving force of the film\\, because it was the strongest and would have given the film direction. It felt like a TV series load of characters crammed into a feature film. Over all disappointing.","true":true}
