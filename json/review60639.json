Saying that though Last of us part 2 hit everything correctly! It could of really been two games.\r\rI dislike when developers bring  outside world issues to video games because its usually done poorly but the way the team managed to weave PTSD & Transgender themes to the game without making it \\\"Trans right movement\\\" was perfect and didn't distract from what was going on but actually added to it.\r\rWhile I understand the poor reviews\\, I don't agree at all with the points they make.\r\rgo play the game! its worth it!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
