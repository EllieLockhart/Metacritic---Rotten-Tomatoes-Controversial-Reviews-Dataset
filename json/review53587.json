Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic Movie!! Original screenplay\\, no rehashing\\, many sentimental moments and lots of laughs as well! Apparently i need to append to this review as i am seeing all this hate coming from the \\\"audience\\\" score. Honestly I dont understand what everyones issue is with this movie. It was fun and exciting and the story is good. Many people hate how luke was portrayed\\, but honestly given what he goes through after the evnts of jedi his story line makes sense. as far as i can see everyone wants luke to be the old luke from the first trilogy\\, guess what things change\\, people change. so why cant that be so in a movie as well. Everyone wants to hold on to their memory of the \\\"magic\\\" of the first trilogy and not let go so there is no room for these stories to move on because you dont like the way the charecters where written in the new trilogy. i call hogwash on that! This is the same crappy attitude that man of steel was met with. Oh he isnt the superman i know\\, blah blah blah. Open your minds people good stories are the ones that keep things in constant flux. I applaud this movie and cant wait for the next installment!!!!","true":true}
