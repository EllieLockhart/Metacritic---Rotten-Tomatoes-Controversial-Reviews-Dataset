Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had a few good moments but a bad plot full of holes stringing together individual set pieces the director wanted to force feed the audience regardless of coherence. Contrived and ridiculous choices and situations to force 'dramatic' moments and twisted characterizations inconsistent with previous movies including The Force Awakens not just original movies.  The cast and crew do a good job\\, but it feels the director Rian Johnson detested any previously established material and deliberately undercut it and tried to replace it with his own 'unique appeal' turning the movie into an awful mess of plot holes\\, force fed and inconsistent moral soap boxes\\, and jarring character changes.","true":true}
