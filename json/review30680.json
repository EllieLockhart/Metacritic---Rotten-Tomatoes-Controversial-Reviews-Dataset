Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SJW's seem to have taken over Hollyweird... were they even familiar with the Star Wars Universe before they pumped out this garbage? Jedi's now need pointy hats and staves\\, Only woman can tackle the Men threatening the galaxy\\, Luke Crywalker etc so on..... way to kill something I have enjoyed for the last 40 years... F U Rian and Disney y'all can burn in hades!","true":true}
