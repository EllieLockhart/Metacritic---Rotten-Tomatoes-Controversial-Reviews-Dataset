Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If all you want is a solid character driven story in space where the stakes matter and the main characters have to make active choices and sacrifices in order to achieve their goals\\, then this film is not for you. Every character is a mary sue\\, every main character has plot armor and even a few of the side characters\\, the motivations of each character are unclear and have no bearing on the story\\, and more. \\n\\n Don't be deceived by the positive reviews or the people just desperately looking for something to love. This is Breaking Bad's \\\"The Fly\\\" level bad\\, which considering the writer\/director\\, should surprise no one. \\n\\nAs such\\, I consider it my civic duty to rate this film as the trash it was.","true":true}
