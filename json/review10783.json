{"101487":127029,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-05","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hands down the worst Star Wars movie ever created and easily one of the worst film scripts written in the past decade; The Last Jedi proves to be so distant from any other Star Wars ever made\\, that it may as well indeed be in a completely different galaxy far\\, far away. The blame for this shockingly bad film\\, seems to rest solely with Rian Johnson (director) and Kathleen Kennedy (producer); the former writing (lol) and the latter approving the 'script'. \\n\\nThe film decides that it doesn't need any of the previous story or canon established over forty years by countless talented artists. Not being a completely new franchise\\, this was a ludicrous position to start with. Inexcusably being the second part of a trilogy\\, it decides that it doesn't need the first chapter in the new trilogy either. All of the fundamental aspects of 'The Force Awakens' that were deliberately left open for the second and third chapters are deliberately discarded and largely ignored or spat upon : Who are Reys parents? What is her lineage? They must be strong with the force indeed\\, right? Wrong! Now Jedis and Siths are not special\\, because apparently ANYONE can be a force user; the idea that jedis and sith being extremely rare and requiring years of intense study and training to become the masters of legend (anakin\\, obi-wan\\, yoda\\, palptine\\, dooku\\, maul\\, luke....) all f'in gone. Who the hell is Snoke? A force user that is THE most powerful force user that we have ever seen\\, a damn near omni-present demi-god\\, who can manipulate force users and manipulate objects that those force users are using the force on\\, without batting an eyelid and while still talking. A force user who can see the future in real time\\, not through meditation. Where did he come from? How old is he? Is he a Sith or the source of all Sith? Is he actually Darth Plaguis mentioned in the prequels by Palpatine? Nah\\, none of the matters\\, we'll kill him off anyway and slam Rey And Ren together at a completely inapproproate moment in the story. In other words in the only the second installment of a new trilogy they have already killed the MAIN antagonist\\, the second half to the two most basic and crucial aspects that you need for any type of drama or conflict - an antagonist and a protagonist. But...don't worry\\, we'll replace him with the weaker Kylo-Ren\\, so just forget that bit where he demonstrates a selfless act by saving Rey\\, because five seconds later he decides\\, well f' that - I am Darth Vader and I want to actually be like Palpatine\\, so I'll kill Palpatine. Trust us\\, this will all work out in the end.\\n\\nBut don't worry we've saturated the script with innapropriate and badly timed humor that ensures that every dramatic moment in the film actually becomes a parody. Brilliant! The Last Space Ball.\\n\\nRey\\, doesn't actually go anywhere as a character\\, only to yet again demonstrate force powers that she couldn't possibly have developed by herself; she ISN'T trained by luke by the end of the film.\\n\\nAnd then there is the way that the old cast are dealt with. Carrie Fisher has passed away. We all die\\, but it is a sad thing to contemplate for people who enjoyed the films in the past. So...I have the perfect idea to show how we deal with that...we'll put her frozen corpse on the screen floating in space. I could hardly f'in believe my eyes\\, like an abstract scene from Twin Peaks cut in to the middle of a disneyfied Star Wars film. And you know\\, if David Lynch had made a scene like that and then knew the actress portrayed in it had died\\, guess what?! He wouldn't have f'in included it in the god damn film. BUT wait..after insulting the dead in this way\\, what better way to continue to turn the most famous character that Carrie Fisher has ever played\\, the role that made her an icon\\, in to a f'in farce - a f'in parody. Let's make leia f'in Supergirl and again reinforce the idea that you don't have to be trained AT all to use the force or to be a jedi\/sith. Yay!\\n\\nAnd then to Luke. Wow. So the character who risked it all to try and save Anakin\\, becasue he felt there was good still in him. The character who interrupted his training to save his friends because he sensed they were in trouble and confronted Vader alone. The character who faced the emperor and Anakin and showed us that he couldn't be turned to the dark side even at the most desperate moment; this character - will NOT go to his friends when they are struggling; will not go to confront Snoke or to try and save Kylo from himself; actually decides to kill his nephew in Kylo's sleep; this character that is the anti-character of Luke and you know what - it is literally that - luke positive skywaker meets luke negative skywalker and then he simply fades out of existence at the end because positively and negatively charged particles cancel each other out\\, it makes perfect sense. Except this isn't a documentary about particle physics for f's sake. They literally faded luke 'A new Hope' Skywalker out of existence and if that doesn't tell you all you need to know about the way that Star Wars has been utterly torn apart and left in the waste paper basket then I don't know what else to tell you. \\n\\nAlso\\, I don't give a f' about all of the political bullshit in the film\\, it had no place in this type of film to start with\\, it would have gone over the heads of the majority of the audience\\, the rest will have ignored it or just felt estranged by it. Sorry but if their was some SJW f'in agenda here\\, it basically went head first into a black hole at light speed\\, just like the rest of the film.","true":true}
