Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was an unfortunately terrible movie apparently made by someone who neither likes Star Wars or understands what Star Wars was really about. The diversity amongst the cast\\, both gender and ethnicity had so much potential for interesting character development instead we were given what amounts to insurgent \/ Twilight in space.","true":true}
