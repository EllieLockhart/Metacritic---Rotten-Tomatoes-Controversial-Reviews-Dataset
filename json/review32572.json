Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars the Last Jedi\\, I have mixed feelings about this film but overall it was well done. I loved how it looked and it felt like star wars to me more so than force awakens. I did feel like some plot points were rushed and for a 2 and a half hour movie\\, I feel Rian focused on the wrong things. Totally worth watching and should be watched at least twice to understand everything. ","true":true}
