Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow! They knocked it out of the park with this one an adrenaline rush from start to finish. So good to see a return to well written core characters in this new saga. Mark Hamill and Adam Driver really stand out. Story wise I'm sure the fans are going to be divided but I think any criticism about story is subjective at the end of the day. Whether or not you like some of the choices made story wise there is no denying it's beautifully crafted popcorn cinema full of great performances.","true":true}
