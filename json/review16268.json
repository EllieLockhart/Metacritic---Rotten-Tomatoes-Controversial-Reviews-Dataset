Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Im not even wasting any more time on the the current state of this franchise by writing a critical review\\, this movie was garbage\\, and I don't see how it could even be possible that it was this bad by accident.","true":true}
