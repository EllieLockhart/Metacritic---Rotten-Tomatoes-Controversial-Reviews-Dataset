Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The ideas of climactic scenes great\\, the visuals fantastic as expected. The character development\\, the writing\\, the inspiration\\, all are completely thrown out. Lucasfilm put their focus into ignoring everything we wanted fulfilled\\, and instead brought in unnecessary characters and unnecessary drama nobody asked for. The writing put onto the screen feels like a mockery to all longtime Star Wars fans. The older characters are all disregarded\\, the newer characters from TFA altered unnecessarily\\, and newest characters brought into the limelight for absolutely no reason. I learned about a former slave girl-turned securty guard and her quest to free goat horses and find an insignificant decoder for about 30 minutes\\, and learned NOTHING about Snoke. And then Rey's parents are the result of writers flat-out giving up. There is nothing to look forward to in Episode IX.\\n Can we please get a do-over?","true":true}
