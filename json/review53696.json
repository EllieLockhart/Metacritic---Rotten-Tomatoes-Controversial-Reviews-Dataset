{"101487":122217,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-24","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Full disclosure: I\u2019m not a Star Wars fan boy. I don\u2019t have any issues with how Last Jedi fits in the \u201ccanon\\,\u201d and I have zero emotional investment in this franchise. Force Awakens and Rogue One were entertaining\\, so I figured this would be more of the same. Nope. I\u2019m mystified by the positive reviews. After fifteen minutes I was bored by the lackluster dialogue and predictable\\, cliched plot \u201ctwists\u201d (oh wait\\, you\u2019re telling me that an actress of Laura Dern\u2019s caliber didn\u2019t sign on to be an inept killjoy and instead was revealed to be a wise hero with an important message? Shocked. SHOCKED.) Every element of this this film was clumsy and predictable\\, if not outright ridiculous (that casino scene...oof). Seriously\\, this movie sucked. ","true":true}
