Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I only created an account to rate this movie.   That is how much I despise what they did with this movie.   Too many plot holes.  Took Luke in a horrible direction.   Apparently the \\\"Rebels\\\" only had 3 ships and 12 people now.   It was just bad.  Normally i would got to the movie several times and have to buy the DVD when it came out.   I will NOT go again and definitely not buy the dvd.  I don't want to see it again and I may not go to another SW movie.","true":true}
