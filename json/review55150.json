Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was very excited to see this movie\\, the trailers looked beautiful and the force awakens left me quite sastified and ready for a return to their universe. But unfortunately by the time the credits rolled\\, I wasn't satisfied. My main problem with the movie was its structure. It had so many stories to tell and plot points to cover that often fell short. For instance when Rei is being trained by Luke\\, even though we spend more than an hour with them\\, it didn't really have the effect I wanted it to. The movie also didn't allow itself to remain on one scene for to long which hurt it. Just when a scene was building tension like the encounter between Kylo Ren and Rei\\, it would cut away to one of its many other happenings. It took away from the movie because it cut away from things that needed time to build and the scene changes were often distracting. I could name a ton of other scenes in the movie that needed for development or build up but that would take to long. The most redeeming factor the movie has is its beautiful visuals. I found myself mesmerized by the amazing shorts and settings found in the movie and for that I appreciated it. The movie entertained as well and did a good job at showing the sacrifices of resistance but in future movies I would like to see a better structured film.","true":true}
