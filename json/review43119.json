Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This one needs to be remade by a capable production team! The whole movie does not make sense. I have never been more angry after leaving the theatre... this children's movie does not deserve any attention\\, except if you're a 6 year old.","true":true}
