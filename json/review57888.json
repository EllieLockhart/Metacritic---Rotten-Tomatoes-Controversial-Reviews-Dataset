Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a beautiful movie!! Character growth and depth\\, deep emotion\\, absolutely hopeful message\\, has that very Star Wars feel...just really like it and could watch it over and over. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley were amazing in this!","true":true}
