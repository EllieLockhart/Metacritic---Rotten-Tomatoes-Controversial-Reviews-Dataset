Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a move above average! Cinematography was beautiful! But as a star wars movie terrible. Waisted potential and raping the lore... left the movie theater angry and betrayed.  We don't have good games anymore\\, save the movies!","true":true}
