Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After all of the hype\\, I finally got to see The Last Jedi today and was left wondering what all of the 90+% reviews were all about.\\nSure\\, there were some great performances from Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) and Adam Driver (Kylo Ren) and the story progressed\\, so it didn't feel like the movie was two and half hours long. But\\, to say this is one of the best Star Wars films is a little misguided.\\nWithout giving the plot away\\, there are a couple of deaths of main characters in the movie . The first was way too easy and the second was totally unnecessary and felt like it was done for pure shock value only (watch the movie and you'll see.)\\nThere are some good space and light battles\\, which drive the Last Jedi forward\\, however the middle of the film really lags and I feel should've been edited better.\\nAt the end of the film\\, I'll admit I am wanting to know what happens next\\,but is this a film I'd watch again and again\\, I'm afraid not.","true":true}
