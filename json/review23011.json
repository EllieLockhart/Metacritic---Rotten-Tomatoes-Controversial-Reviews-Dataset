Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lots of the criticism from nostalgic fans misses the key ideas of this movie including that of letting go of the past. I loved the way it subverted my expectations and what we thought was important. Unlike The Force Awakens\\, this was a surprising and innovative Star Wars movie and it was the better for it.","true":true}
