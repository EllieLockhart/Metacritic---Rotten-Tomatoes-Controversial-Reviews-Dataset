Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I created an account and left a review for the first time ever because I feel it's my duty as a lifelong Star Wars fan to do my part and express how horrified\\, angry\\, and heartbroken I am at what they've done to the franchise.  There have been bad Star Wars films before\\, but for the many\\, many reasons others have outlined\\, the saga going forward is beyond repair.","true":true}
