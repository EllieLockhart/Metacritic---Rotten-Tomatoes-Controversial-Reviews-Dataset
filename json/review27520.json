Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall\\, I thought this movie was...okay. It\u2019s not Phenomenal\\, but it\u2019s not awful either. Are there some stupid subplots? Yes. Is it visually appealing? Absolutely. The self proclaimed \u201cdie hard\u201d Star Wars fans will probably not like it\\, which explains why it has a low audience score. But is it better than Force Awakens? In my honest opinion\\, yes ","true":true}
