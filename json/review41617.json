Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is...great\\, good special efects\\, great battles\\,  a new history and the soundtrack\\, oh\\, what to talk about\\, beatiful\\, star wars: the last jedi is better than the force awakens","true":true}
