Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was not terrible. But it still left me disappointed\\, for reasons that others have already described in great detail. However\\, the backlash back-and-forth between critics and audiences has been fascinating. So why are critic scores so high and audience scores so low?\\n\\nTwo words: Rian Johnson. Not necessarily Rian Johnson the director\\, but Rian Johnson the  person. From what I can gather\\, Johnson is an awesome guy. He's kind\\, dignified\\, accessible... everything most big-budget directors are not. He has built personal relationships with critics\\, bloggers and podcasters like no other director working today. Many people in the film-criticism world are actual friends of his\\, and many others feel like they could be friends should the opportunity arise.\\n\\nSo imagine you're a critic\\, invited to the world-premiere of one of the most anticipated movies in history. Not only are you basically friends with the director\\, amazed that the guy you interviewed years ago after \\\"Brick\\\" has now directed a Star Wars movie\\, you're also rubbing elbows with some of today's biggest movie stars\\, all while being enveloped in the Disney hype machine. Think you might see The Last Jedi through rose-colored glasses? I think you might\\, and I think many did.\\n\\nThe only critic I've seen broach this view so far is the always-great Joanna Robinson at Vanity Fair. I think other critics need to take a step back and see if their view has been clouded by how much they love Johnson.\\n\\nI was so excited when it was announced Johnson would be directing The Last Jedi. I loved Looper. That movie had swagger. The Last Jedi does not have swagger. Don't get me wrong\\, Johnson is still a great guy\\, even if The Last Jedi is not up to snuff.\\n\\nOne last thing: The Last Jedi lost me early. I haven't seen anyone else mention this\\, but there's a shot in the first few minutes of the film where a couple of Resistance fighters are walking on the surface of the planet that's being attacked. There's a huge (green screen) explosion RIGHT BEHIND THEM and they're just walking casually and almost jokingly asking each other if they should evacuate. It was an early bad omen for me.","true":true}
