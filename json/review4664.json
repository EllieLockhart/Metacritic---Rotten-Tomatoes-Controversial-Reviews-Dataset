{"101487":113566,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Complete betrayal and disrespect of the characters every Star Wars fan grew up loving. Shallow plot with too many fake-outs and cheap thrills. no depth to this movie. Those that truly love Star Wars will leave fealing betrayed. THE LAST JEDI IS A SLAP IN THE FACE TO THE HISTORY OF STAR WARS AND ALL WHO HOLD IT DEAR","true":true}
