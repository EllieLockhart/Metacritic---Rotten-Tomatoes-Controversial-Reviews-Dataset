Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a fun movie that turned a lot of conventions on their head.  There are a handful of deliberate call backs to some of the earlier films\\, but things don't always turn out the way you would expect them to or maybe even hope them to turn out.  All in all\\, I thoroughly enjoyed.  I am almost as amused at all the hate for the movie as I was by the movie itself.  The vast majority of the complaints appear to be fanboys (and girls) crying that the movie didn't present things the way they wanted it\\, answer the questions they felt should be answered in this movie rather than the next\\, or complain about the way that questions were answered.  Go into this movie with no preconceptions and I guarantee you will have a great time.","true":true}
