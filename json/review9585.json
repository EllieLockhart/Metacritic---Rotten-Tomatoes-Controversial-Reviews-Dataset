Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good Lord. 2 stars because it was sort of fun despite visually and audibly describing what MINDLESSNESS means. I just wonder how these critics were comp'd. The most dangerously stupid characters I've seen EVER make their debut in this movie. This movie was clearly made by an entitled brat that \\\"knows what's best\\\" for this franchise and knows what canon needs to die...\\, Pretty images\\, nice scenes\\, it's time to just move on I guess.\\n\\n....\\, I still can't get over 92% percent fresh\\, LMFAO! -- Okay.....","true":true}
