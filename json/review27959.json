Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plenty of youtube reviews to go into spoilers.  The problem is they\\, this film's makers\\, appear to hate this franchise and its fans.  Sad.  Killed a franchise.  I cannot imagine ever seeing anything remotely related to this property ever again.","true":true}
