The evolution of graphics and new elements in the gameplay evolve as well as the story\\, which proves to be beautiful and violent at the same time\\, with extremely well-built characters\\, with well-defined personalities\\, which makes them unique. The photography direction work is clever when using smooth travellings almost uncut during their cutscenes which make them perfectly fluid\\, making it impossible to discern when the gameplay ends and the cutscene begins. The art direction of the game is impeccable. Each scene in the game looks like a painting thanks to the wonderful and colorful scenarios that\\, even in times of urgency\\, it is impossible not to recognize the wonder of the game world\\, even in a dystopian setting with a dazzling mix between nature and man. The subtle and striking soundtrack also has a beautiful and important role\\, as it marks the moments of action and calm in the narrative in a cautious and delicate way. The innovation of some features such as dodge\\, passwords for safes\\, skill tree and verticality in the gameplay bring a sense of evolution for both the game creators and the players\\, which gives more authenticity to the game and emerges the player even more in the world that it is inserted. The story shows in an elegant and magnificent way the consequences of how a simple action can have\\, the price that hasty decisions charge and how the vision of hero and villain are abstract and depend only on the point of view\\, all thanks to very well fitted plot twists and explained that it keeps the curiosity and mystery of the story until its end. By inserting the LGBT universe in the story\\, the narrative gains even more value when dealing with such a current and important theme in a delicate and adorable way. This game is a masterpiece of the games and will certainly mark the end of a console generation as the best game of the decade\\, just like its predecessor\\, which thanks to the super dedicated and attentive team from Naughty Dog and the fabulous Neil Druckmann\\, is an amazing\\, incredible\\, wonderful\\, charming and above all\\, exciting game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
