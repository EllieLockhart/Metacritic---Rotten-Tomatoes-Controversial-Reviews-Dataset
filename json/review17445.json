Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw this last night and I absolutely loved it. I was on reddit after the movie and I saw a tremendous amount of people bashing it\\, because it went a different direction than what they perceived what would happen. I?m sick of Star Wars fans always complaining- it was an awesome movie with an amazing message and provided the very essence of Star Wars. If you didn?t understand the creative direction then you obviously don?t know what Star Wars is supposed to represent.","true":true}
