Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can see how this makes a controversy  in the Star Wars community.  It is obviously not the greatest star wars movie.  I'm not exactly  satisfied  with what Disney has done with this sequel series.  I will oppose what people say when they say that it isn't star wars canon because in star wars there is so much to explain so\\, what they are doing right now with all the extra movies is definitely necessary to fill the hole that is the last jedi. I hope to see some explaining in the future prequels.","true":true}
