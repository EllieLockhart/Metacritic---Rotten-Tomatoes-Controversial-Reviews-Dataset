Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"OK. I can understand a bit the backlash here. But I can't agree with it. The film is really good. I'm guessing that some people were expecting another fan service based on what E7 happened and how they wanted their fan theory working on it.\\n\\nBut the film feels fresh. They are actually trying something new here and most of it based for the new generation of viewers and not old dogs like myself and other old time hardcore fans around.\\n\\nStop fooling yourselves people! This is not a story for Luke and cia\\, but Rey and the others. This movie is TOTALLY devoted on grow those characters\\, they learn with their mistakes and also how to rely on the older and more experienced characters. \\n\\nThere is only two points that I can concede here on the criticism\\, but I don't want to give spoilers here. And by all means\\, those things don't affect the general experience around.","true":true}
