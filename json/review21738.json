Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just a thought: If the original movie in 1977 had been this lacking\\, hollow\\, and devoid of soul\\, there is no WAY it would have lasted 40 years. This movie is so bad in so many ways\\, and such a disappointment.\\n\\nI wasn't that keen on TFW when I first saw it\\, but at least it did bring up some interesting questions and possibilities. This movie\\, TLJ\\, completely tossed all of those into the toilet and flushed them away. What a waste.\\n\\nWe need 'a new hope\\,' but I don't think Disney has it in them to give us that. They just don't seem to 'get it.' I shan't be lining up to see any of the Rian Johnson new trilogy they have planned. He's the biggest problem with this new film. He failed\\, big time. \\n\\nAt least we'll always have Tatooine. #missyouGeorge","true":true}
