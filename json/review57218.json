Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie completely takes a dump on the Star Wars mythology. Still don't know who snoke is or how he existed during the rise and fall of the empire with the rule of two in place. Or how his knowledge of the dark side grew over the years. Who was his teacher? No one knows it's like they just wrote him in to kill him off. Why not just make kylo ren the main villain in the first place. The things Rey could do early on in the force awakens could've been reconciled with giving her actual parents of significance. Luke's legacy is tarnished he wouldn't kill his own father and turn to the dark side I don't think he would contemplate killing his own nephew in his sleep. They turned one of my childhood heroes into a coward. This movie sucked I think I'm moving on as Luke sky walker did. I never leave reviews but this movie is so hyped up true fans deserve to know how Luke became a coward... sorry guys it was a good run they can't fix this...","true":true}
