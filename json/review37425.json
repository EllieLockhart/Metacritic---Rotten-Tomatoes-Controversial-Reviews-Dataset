{"101487":178156,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are a lot of fans who loved this movie and seem to be upset at other fans that were disappointed or didn't like it.  It's great that Star Wars evokes passion at this level.  It's kind of sad\\, like the TLJ\\, that the passion is self-defeating.\\n\\nAfter the movie\\, opening night\\, we walked out and my gf asked me what I thought.  I said I needed to process and think about everything.  I'd want to see it again regardless\\, because duh Star Wars.  I slept on it\\, thought some more\\, and realized that I felt kind of bleh.  Disappointed.  Just disappointed that this is where they decided to take things.  Like they needed to sacrifice the old to make the new.  But it's not my story to tell\\, and it's still Star Wars\\, so that in itself is not the reason I overall didn't like the movie.  It didn't seem to flow correctly in the Star Wars universe.\\n\\nSpoilers:\\n- Luke sees his\/father's lightsaber for the first time in over 30 years and tosses it... huh?  Even though he's now a hermit depressed wank\\, he woulda said 'whoa\\, I'm so not going to train you but\\, where and how did you find this??'\\n\\n- Leia doing a space walk floaty move - What?  Ok.\\n\\n- Luke\\, who refused to kill Vader\\, instead believing in the good in him\\, and having that belief justified by the destruction of the emperor\\, actually considers killing his nephew in cold blood while he's sleeping?  Really?  Completely unLuke.  It just felt so wrong.\\n\\n- BB-8 driving half a walker.  I love BB-8 but c'mon.\\n\\n- A slow speed space chase for half the movie.  It felt so... yuck.  Like the First Order couldn't do a little baby jump and catch up\\, or\\, something?  Ah well.\\n\\n- This was the kicker for me.  40 minutes of completely unnecessary and clunky sideplot to find a stud hacker (which they didn't) (because they went to jail for parking in someone's yard) to break onto Snopes ship and break the tracker\\, etc etc.  NONE of that happens in a slightly logical setting in Star Wars.  The Vice Admiral lets her best pilot and hero of Starkiller's destruction in on her little plan when he asks her what the plan is.  That was just stupid.  Stupid stupid stupid.  The only reason I can think of that this sideshow existed was so Rian could have some force sensitive kid(s) show up in his trilogy later.  No.\\n\\n- The last 20 or so minutes had me coming back to the light.  I was almost there\\, and then Luke wasn't there and instead died cus he just did too much stud force usage.  Right.  Leia takes a nap and is fine after being exploded into space and zooming back through it's vacuum.  But Luke meditated too hard.\\n\\nI was honestly surprised\\, thinking back through all this unflowing crap\\, that the Falcon didn't just spontaneously catch on fire and say its own idiotic goodbye.\\n\\nI loved TFA\\, even the prequels were good to me\\, The Clone Wars Series was great\\, Rebels is great\\, played every game I could get my hands on\\, read all kinds of supplementary material\\, and guess what\\, I'm a huge fan of all of it.\\n\\nThis movie seemed without good flow\\, careless\\, clumsy\\, and a bit blasphemous.  It could have not gone the way a lot of people thought\\, and still not put off so many people.  It didn't come from TFA.  It didn't come from Star Wars.  It just used its universe.","true":true}
