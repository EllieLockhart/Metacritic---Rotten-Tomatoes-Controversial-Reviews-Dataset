Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing. Did not feel like Star Wars and whilst you certainly can't accuse the film makers of playing it safe in my view many of the choices were bizarre and betrayed what had come before. I particularly disliked the humour which felt forced and was mostly distracting rather than funny\\, the Leia space thing\\, the gambling planet sub plot and some of the creature effects were really ropey (particularly a little green fella who looked nothing like how he should). Plus points were some decent action scenes and performances. I would rank only just above the Phantom Menace and Clones. Third worst Star Wars film.","true":true}
