Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was enjoyable. It had some good action in it and some lighthearted humor that was nice. I didn't like it as much as episode 7 and I definitely didn't like it as much as Rouge One. A decent Star Wars movie\\, but not the best. ","true":true}
