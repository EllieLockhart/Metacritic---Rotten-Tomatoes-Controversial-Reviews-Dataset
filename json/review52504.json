Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A horrible mess of a movie with a few good moments. This wasn't a \\\"bad Star Wars movie\\\" this was a bad movie\\, period. The Avengers style humor while unwelcomed is one of the less atrocious things in this mess\\,every single new character is horrible\\, it have to be seen to be believed. Don't pay to watch this movie.","true":true}
