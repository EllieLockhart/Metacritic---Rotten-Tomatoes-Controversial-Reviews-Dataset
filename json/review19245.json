Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its not all bad but plotholes\\, a jumpy narrative and  sense of bleakness run throughout the film. Although It is a movie about failure\\, I still  found it somewhat  disrespectful to the existing characters with unusually timed humour sometimes undercutting dramatic moments. There are some wonderful parts in this movie but it feels uneven. Its a shame real critique has been overshadowed by nasty underserved comments and a greater shame that fine actors have been harassed on social media. The actors are all fantastic throughout and I believe if the last movie addresses the end of the story well this episode will be loved a lot more by fans of the franchise","true":true}
