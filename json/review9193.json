Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Gaping plot holes\\, character inconsistencies\\, a very unnecessary subplot\\, and the constant undercutting of emotional moments with out of place jokes ruin what was otherwise a movie with a lot of potential. Approximately 45 minutes of this movie belongs on the cutting room floor\\, and many of the themes suggested in the teasers and trailers are only explored superficially at best. I found the writing to be extremely questionable\\, and the main plotline they chose to adhere to severely limited everything else they tried to do. Ultimately\\, this movie tried to do too many things with too many characters\\, and failed at nearly all of them.","true":true}
