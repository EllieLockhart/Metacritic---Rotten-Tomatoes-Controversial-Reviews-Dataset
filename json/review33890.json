Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible. Poor story. so many plot holes. Luke skywalker was disgraced. No effort put into coming up with a decent story. So many inconsistencies with the original saga. So many needless characters. Regret paying to watch this nonsense. SW has been ruined beyonf repair. Sad.","true":true}
