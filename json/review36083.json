Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi was a 100% well rounded movie. I myself am a mega fan of the entire series. Although I wish the storyline had turned to the EU path\\, I still understand why they couldn't. Too much time had past between movies. Luke's age didn't match the EU storyline age at the time when episode 7 came out. So there was just no chance. \\n\\nI still find myself dreaming of seeing grand Master Luke Skywalker leading his army of Jedi and teaching at his Jedi academy. Along with Mara Jade and everything else that goes along with the EU. What true fan wouldn't want to see all that on the big screen?\\n\\nAt the same time\\, the last Jedi in my opinion is right there with the empire strikes back. Almost perfect as far as cannon goes. Great job\\, except for the lack of the EU storyline.","true":true}
