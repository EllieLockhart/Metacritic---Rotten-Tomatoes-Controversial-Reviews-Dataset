Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie destroyed everything meaningful about this franchise.  How can anyone even go back to the original films and have any respect for Luke and his hero's journey knowing how things turn out in the end?  I saw the original in 1977 and Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson ruined it.  The second most offensive aspect of this movie\\, (after destroying Luke's entire back story\\, and character)\\, was the in your face social social justice diatribe.  We have General Gender Studies\\, a character nobody ever heard of or cares about\\, who comes off as a cringeworthy parody of social justice\\, dying in a manner  that would have probably have been better suited for Ackbar\\, (who was simply blasted out of his ship in a battle).  Under Kathleen \\\"the force is female\\\" Kennedy and Rian \\\"tear it all down\\\" Johnson's treatment\\, nobody has to be special or go through any personal journey and rigorous training to be a Jedi; heck everyone can do it.  After two movies\\, it is obvious that Rey can do anything\\, so it is impossible for her to grow as a character.  This movie was really bad\\, full of plot holes and contrivances\\, involving characters nobody cares about.  This is a Disney reboot and retelling of the entire franchise that destroys the entire cannon and replaces it with SJWs that will rule the galaxy where white men are either evil or goofs.  It is perfectly possible to have strong women characters without demeaning men. Laura Dern's character was an absolute joke","true":true}
