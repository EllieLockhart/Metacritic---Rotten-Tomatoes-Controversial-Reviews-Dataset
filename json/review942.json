Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An insult to the original trilogy and episode 7. The Last Jedi Feels completely disconnected to the rest of the universe and ignored the set up of the previous movie. It feels like whoever wrote the characters has never seen any of the movies or has any understanding on who they are. This film has ruined the legacy of Luke Skywalker and leaves the future of this trilogy feeling bleak. It also completely sidelines the Rey and only uses her as a prob in Kylo's story which i find incredibly offensive as a women. Waste of the new characters introduced as non are given a coherent backstory or meaningful screen time. No character development at all for returning characters and leaves a disappointing taste after viewing. If you're a women looking for an empowering movie that can stand on its own this is not it. I personally would rather watch the prequels.","true":true}
