The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"First off\\, let me say this game is decisive when it comes to the player base. That can be seen from the reviews alone. But for the open-minded\\, this game breaks beyond the mold that is storytelling in video games. By the end of the game I had gone through so many emotions. I had laughed and cried along with the characters. Every death\\, whether it be Joel\\, Jesse\\, or the suspected death of Tommy\\, literally had me putting my hand on my mouth in fear and melancholy. The character development\\, and storytelling that is done without dialogue (such as reading Ellie\u2019s journal) is phenomenal\\, and the average player wouldn\u2019t even know it was there. The player that goes the extra mile and reads the small things like that will truly appreciate the story. Let me get on to one of the biggest \u201cupsets\u201d for the game\\, the ending. At the end of the game\\, you fight Abby who is the woman who killed Joel and Jesse. During this fight\\, Abby\u2019s surrogate son \u201cLev\u201d is injured and unconscious in a boat nearby. Ellie beats Abby and is holding her underwater\\, on the verge of drowning her. It\u2019s during this brutal cutscene\\, that you see a very short flashback of Joel on his porch\\, picking away at his guitar. Ellie then gets off of Abby and tells her to take the boat and leave. I think so many players despised this ending for Abby\\, because they were so focused on the perspective of Joel and Ellie. Just like Ellie at the beginning of the game\\, they were blind with hatred and wanting revenge\\, no matter the cost. I believe that the flashback serves as Ellie remembering what Joel meant to her. She didn\u2019t want anyone to feel the pain she felt by losing a parent figure\\, So Ellie lets Abby go. I won\u2019t speak on the rest of the ending because it is so masterfully crafted and moving that you really should experience for yourself. Any fan of the first game is going to feel a deep sense of closure when you hear that credit soundtrack. This game has changed the way I will forever see storytelling. Another masterpiece and my new favorite game\\, all thanks to Naughty Dog.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
