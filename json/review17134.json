Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoy the movie I must say I really liked it and loved it but at the same time I'm kind of disappointed how Luke Skywalker is treated in this movie it Jedi Master that we only saw at the end of how powerful he is wanted to see more like Ray can have a father that she never had a master and Apprentice this couldn't let into a bigger Story Part line towards the third film but if Ryan Johnson wanted to end the iconic character in that fashion then oh well there's nothing that you or anybody can say it is what it is","true":true}
