Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi shines for its originality.  There are so many surprises\\, so many twists and turns you really don't know what's coming next.  That to me was my biggest complaint with The Force Awakens.  It lacked originality.  I know fans wanted to see the Star Wars franchise go back to its roots after the abomination that was the Prequel Trilogy\\, but The Force Awakens seemed like it was trying too hard to copy almost everything from A New Hope.  Instead The Last Jedi went in so many different directions that it was difficult or almost impossible to guess the outcome before it happened","true":true}
