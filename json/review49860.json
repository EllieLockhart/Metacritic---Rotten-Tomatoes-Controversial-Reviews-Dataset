Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yo momma jokes\\, flying super leia\\, thumbs up yoda lightning strike\\, and two whole movies with Rei and we still don't know anything about her. All the build up from the first movies thrown away. I'm more disappointed then mad. Jumanji has beat the tar out of this movie. Think about that.","true":true}
