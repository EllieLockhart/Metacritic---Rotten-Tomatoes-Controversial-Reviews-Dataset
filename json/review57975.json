Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When I watched The Last Jedi\\, it left me stunned and speechless. A few hours after seeing it I was convinced that I hated the movie\\, but when I woke up the next day\\, I realised I actually loved it.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi is a movie that entirely throws away the traditional star wars formula. Everything that happens in the movie is unexpected and bold\\, with several characters dying unexpectedly\\, and some might say needlessly. However\\, it all serves a purpose in the end. The movie doesn't make sense immediately\\, but once the shock goes away\\, it reveals itself to be the darkest and most desperate star wars movie ever created. Revenge of the Sith seems like a picnic in comparison. Yet\\, the movie sets up a new precedent; that anything can happen in the star wars universe.\\n\\nThe movie does have it's flaws as well\\, with it obviously suffering from the age old \\\"too much content to fit the playtime\\\" -problem\\, making the movie one massive and fast-paced imperial march which simply punches everyone who doesn't keep up in the face and leaves them crying on the floor. It's a 4-hour movie crammed into 2 and a half hours\\, which is what causes most of it's problems. The creators of the movie created too much and maybe removed too much in too short of a time.\\n\\nIf a new hope is the kid in school that everyone equally loves\\, then The Last Jedi is the kid who beats you up\\, takes your lunch money and then shares that money with his friends.\\n\\nDo not go into The Last Jedi expecting a traditional Star Wars experience\\, because that is the farthest thing from what you're going to get.","true":true}
