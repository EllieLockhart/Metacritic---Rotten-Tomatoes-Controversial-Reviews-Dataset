Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers ahead: The people rating this movie high are the ADHD crowd that likes to look up from their phone and see something explode. The movie is full of ridiculous plot wholes\\, paper-thin\\, one dimensional characters\\, Luke milking and then immediately drinking green milk from the engorged breasts of a space walrus\\, and subplots that go nowhere and serve no valid purpose. There are 2 quotes that sum up the whole approach to this movie AND Disney's feelings toward the legions of Gen X OT fans that drive this franchise and brought their children into the SW universe: First\\, Kylo Ren \\\"Let the past die\\, Kill it\\, if you have to.\\\" Then ghost Yoda speaking to Luke about the Jedi of the OT: \\\"We are what they grow beyond.\\\" In other words\\, time to move on to... \\n\\nTo a galaxy (same galaxy as before? it's hard to know because Rian Johnson just ignored all the rules of the realm and made up his own)  where -in just one example of MANY- people can survive in space (forget Leia's stupid WTF moment- I'm talking about Rose's sister at the very beginning\\, She's hanging out in space at the bottom of the bomber and it's totally a non-issue). \\n\\nOne minute\\, the FO can blast thru the transport's shield\\, the next moment Kylo flies inside the ship and blows up all the Resistance fighters\\, then TIEs blow up the bridge of the ship\\, killing Adm. Ackbar in a footnote moment and sending Leia into space where she becomes a self-propelled fairy\\, then the next moment they can't blast thru the shield again and we have galaxies longest\\, most ridiculous slow-speed chase. The FO can obliterate planets\\, but one transport with an energy shield and dying fuel resources (despite the fact that it JUST LAUNCHED from its base) is untouchable. That's just the tip of the iceberg. Luke's death would be a joke if it weren't so stupid and saga-killing. \\n\\nThere's no point in even watching Ep. IX- every OT character is dead and Mary Sue will save the day against the bumbling\\, inept First Order. Seriously- that's where we're at\\, and that's all that's left.","true":true}
