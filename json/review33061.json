Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"stupidest Star Wars movie ever made it should be thrown out and try again.  What I mean by this is don't make Episode 9 remake Episode 8 without Rian Johnson.  The only positive thing I can say about this movie is it was visually pleasing.","true":true}
