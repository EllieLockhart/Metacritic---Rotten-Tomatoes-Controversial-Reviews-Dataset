Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really don't get all the hate for The Last Jedi. It's a rich story that honors the Star Wars legacy as it transitions to it's new heroes. It's as emotionally engaging as any previous offering. John Williams' score is amazing as always.\\nTo the haters: get over yourselves.","true":true}
