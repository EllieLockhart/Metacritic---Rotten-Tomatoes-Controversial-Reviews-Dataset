Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Between the poor humor that only distracts from the story\\, the uninteresting slew of characters\\, the myriad of subplots that go nowhere\\, and the bizarre treatment of original characters\\, this movie actually does nothing to honor the series' legacy while adding \\\"surprising\\\" twists that add nothing to the mythos. Also\\, the word \\\"fuel\\\" is said about 6 times in the first act. Since when was fuel ever a problem in Star Wars? Incidentally\\, that subplot also went nowhere\\, which is indicative of the entire movie. This thing is a bloated mess with a shabby script and undisciplined direction.","true":true}
