Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is a big disappointment.  It's way too long and the plot makes no sense at all.  Most of all\\, the way they portrait Luke in the movie.  He is bitter\\, and full of self-pity.  This is not the Luke I know who never gave up his father Vader.  Even if you are not comparing it to the original trilogies or even the prequels\\, as a stand alone movie\\, it's just incoherent and the characters are not likable.  They put down the myth about Snoke and then kicked him off in a matter of minutes.  I know what Disney is trying to do\\, they wanted you to forget about the original story lines and characters\\, and develop new themes and characters\\, so that they can create more extended-universe\\, movies\\, tv\\, cartoons\\, and milk your money.  Thanks Disney\\, and Ria Johnson.  You won't see me in the theater watching another of your \\\"great\\\" creation.","true":true}
