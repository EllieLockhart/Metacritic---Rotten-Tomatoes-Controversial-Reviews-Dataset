Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A very good Rian Johnson movie but not the best Star Wars movie. Johnson succeeds on so many levels but there are areas that do not fit at all as a sequel to the Force Awakens. The Last Jedi tries a lot of new things\\, some work but some completely mishandle story set up by JJ Abrams.\\nIt fails to set things up for a grand finale\\, instead ending on a mediocre note that doesn't leave much room for build-up. A couple of tweaks could have made this a great movie. It needed some discussion with Abrams to better connect the stories. In the end\\, you're left with a pretty average Star Wars tale.","true":true}
