Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SJWs got ahold of Star Wars and destroyed it. All men are wrong and all women are right in this movie. Should also be called minority wars but they forgot Asian-Indian and maybe an Eskimo? Shallow characters and selfish... not selfless motives. Capitalism is bad. Woman can do no wrong and need NO TRAINING AT ALL to become just as good or better than men.\\nOh and I forgot ... HUGE plot holes. Since when is light speed a weapon and why havent they used that before.. and  why couldnt they destroy the entire first order using it?!","true":true}
