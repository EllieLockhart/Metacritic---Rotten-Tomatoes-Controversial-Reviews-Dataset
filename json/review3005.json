Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"bad movie. as a sci fi movie it had so many pointless sub plots. as a star wars movie they did it all wrong. luke is treated badly. the back story makes no sense. it conradicts the force awakens. no reasonable ecplanations to anything thats going on. very very dissapointing. to me star wars saga ends i  return of the jedi. so sad. so mad.","true":true}
