Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"2.5 max for now! This MIGHT change later upon a more intimate viewing at my own house where I can pause\\, rewind\\, etc... outside that this is prequel level stuff upon first viewing IMHO!","true":true}
