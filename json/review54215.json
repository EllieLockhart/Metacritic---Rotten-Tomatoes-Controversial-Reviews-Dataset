Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you are willing to overlook some major plot holes\\, this is a good action movie. It has humor that many will appreciate\\, it has gorgeous visuals\\, and the acting is pretty good. It is not\\, however\\, a good Star Wars film. In the very first scene\\, Poe Dameron plays an awkward phone prank call joke on General Hux. Hux is portrayed as a sniveling\\, practically mentally handicapped comedic relief bad guy\\, which prevented me from being able to take the main villains of the movie (the enigmatic \\\"first order\\\") seriously. Sadly\\, this movie is full of these awkward jokes that may be appropriate in a parody film somewhat reminiscent of the TV show \\\"The Orville.\\\" What results is a Star Wars film that seems to be afraid of taking itself seriously\\, going so far as to almost seem to poke fun at fans who would enjoy a film devoid of this type of humor.","true":true}
