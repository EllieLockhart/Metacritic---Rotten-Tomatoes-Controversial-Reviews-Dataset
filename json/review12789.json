Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'd give it zero stars if possible. I've loved Star Wars for years. Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy have single handedly ruined the franchise in one less than expert stroke. They completely betrayed the characters and spirit of Star Wars. Every male character is portrayed as either misogynistic or incompetent or both. Basic rules of the story universe were just ignored or purposely cast aside. There aren't enough negative adjectives in all spoken languages combined to sufficiently describe just how bad it is. The constant underpinnings of social justice warrior nonsense is panderingly sickening. They have forever lost me as a fan.  Horrific. Utterly.","true":true}
