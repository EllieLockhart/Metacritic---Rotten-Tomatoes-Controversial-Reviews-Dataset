Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What I can say that has not being said about this awful movie? Worse SW movie ever - if it can be considered a SW movie at all. I had the impression that I was watching a lousy Star Trek movie\\, instead. I lost all interest in watching the next and supposedly last SW movie. Will Rey marry Kylo? Will Rey kill Kylo? Will Finn marry Rose? Why should I care? \\nWish Gareth Edwards had directed the episodes 7-8.","true":true}
