Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just didn't like it\\, they wasted a lot of screen time on pointless scenes\\, it was slow and dumb. I don't know what kind of fan the writer director is but I'm not a fan of this movie. JJ should have done it the first one gave hope for the reboot now it's lost. They killed the main characters off wtf is the point?","true":true}
