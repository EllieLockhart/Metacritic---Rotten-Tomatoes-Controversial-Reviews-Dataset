Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In short: Not as bad as the prequels\\, but worse than the original trilogy or force awakens. If you like every half-dramatic moment broken up by a sarcastic quip\\, you'll probably like this movie. But then again\\, they already made a sequel to Guardians of the Galaxy.\\n\\nIn Long: A new director takes over with no clear sense of where the story should go\\, so everything seems like a set up to a series of terrible jokes. The actual story the movie does try to tell has so many plot holes it is almost nonsensical. The acting is fine\\, and the special effects are great\\, but at the end of the day there is simply no compelling story to pull it all together. There is also no clear sense of character development or rationale for the decisions made\\, so that every line carries an even greater sense of being a set piece designed solely to set up another terrible pun. Save your money and your time\\, and don't see it.","true":true}
