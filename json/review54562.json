Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm giving The Last Jedi\\, 3 stars. The movie was a good movie\\, but to be honest\\, that not what I\\, and many of the audience expected. We wanted a great movie\\, and got this.\\n\\nIll start my review by saying I am ABSOLUTELY a huge Star Wars fanboy. I hated the prequels\\, and loved the Force Awakens.\\n\\nLet's start with the good. Mark Hamill was amazing as he reprised his role of Luke Skywalker. He was underused\\, but I loved every second of him on screen. Poe Dameron was excellent as well. The overlying plot was pretty good and Ill just say it now\\, the visuals are AMAZING. There is one scene that just made the audience gasp in awe. I won't spoil it\\, but you'll know when you see it.\\n\\n\\n The biggest issue with this movie is that i feel like they tried to add too many plot twists and too many character arcs into one movie. Rey and Finn feel like they didn't get enough development. The whole saying and reusing quotes from the originals is almost a bit insulting and annoying. We get it\\, nostalgia\\, but don't jam it down the audience's throat. Kylo Ren's character feels even weaker then he was in Force Awakens\\, and going into the next movie\\, I don't like that.\\n\\nOverall though\\, its a 7\/10 in my book. Go see it\\, The Last Jedi is still good.\\n\\nFor more refence\\, this is how I rate the Star Wars movies:\\n1. Empire Strikes Back\\n2. A New Hope\\n3. The Force Awakens\\n4. Return of the Jedi\\n5. Rogue One\\n6. The Last Jedi","true":true}
