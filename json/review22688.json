Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like most\\, very excited to see The Last Jedi. Like some\\, I really enjoyed the last installment\\, The Force Awakens. However\\, after the credits rolled I knew something was off\\, wrong - contradictory to the last film in an almost deliberate ways. I am not sure why Rian Johnson would be allowed to write an installment that focuses on negating the last film in such a focused method\\, with certain overtones of empowerment and political opinion sort of bleeding through the film in spite of the story line. I enjoyed the experience of watching a new chapter of Star Wars on the big screen\\, the spectacle of it all is the pinnacle of special effects and quality on a technical side. However\\, this film is a very frustrating one\\, my hope is JJ Abrams can repair the damage done to the overall story arch damage created in The Last Jedi.","true":true}
