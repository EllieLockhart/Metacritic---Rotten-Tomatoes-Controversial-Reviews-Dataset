Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This Star Wars is the biggest pile of garbage ever when compared to the other Star Wars movies\\, here's the thing\\, if you are a die hard fan you're going to hate it\\, if this is your first time seeing star wars you're either going to like it\\, or be confused. My main issues are Leia flying in space.... the easiest death for the most powerful ancient sith force user in the universe\\, and the idiotic unnecessary death of Luke Skywalker. Luke's job was not finished he had Rey to train further and still had to actually face Kylo without wimping out. I could go on for months about how betrayed I feel but I'm going to go and listen to Anakin explain why he hates sand and then I'll have Jarr Jar tell me how grateful he is for being dead already and not having to experience this nightmare of a star wars film.!","true":true}
