Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst movie of 2017 because of the director and pathetic storyline. Adam Driver was great (Semper Fidelis) but the other cast choices were horrible and the roles were weak. Full of liberal propaganda\\, feminism\\, and anti capitalism agenda. I guss we dont have enough of the fake new pushing their agenda\\, now we have to watch it in a Galaxy Far Far Away when we're looking for a fantasy to excape too away from the lefts bombardment. It was blantet that the dirction was going to feminism from he last movie but it changed to an unwachable attact on men showing hem as emotional and unreliable and the many strong level headed females saved the day iver and over. What is his\\, opposite day? This was not the last jedi\\, it was the last straw for me. I will not watch the next one and my kids will not either. Th casino scene was forced into to plot and awkward and didnt fit. And Lukes character was a forceless urine stained vagabond homeless vagrant that was chopped like a chump leaving Adam Driver to carry the show of weak actors\\, weak storyline\\, weak liberalism\\, weak directing (lense flare anyone?) #starwarssucks #lastjedisucks","true":true}
