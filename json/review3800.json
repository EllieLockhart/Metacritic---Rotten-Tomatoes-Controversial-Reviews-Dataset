Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Big disappointment. The standards were set to too high level by TFA\\, which was not a perfect movie either and had quite many retro vibes\\, but after this mess it feels like true classic. Many good ingredients in TLJ but the outcome is below average scifi action without emotional depth\\, which is expected from SW movies. Similar emptiness that is present in the horrible prequels. Movie is full of boring CGI battles\\, new boring characters (CGI and real) and boring side plots. It is amazing to see all the positive reviews from the critics. Obviously this is NOT a good movie. What is going on? Abrams did a nice job in TFA and will be busy in fixing this mess generated by Kennedy and Johnson. I seriously hope he can do it.","true":true}
