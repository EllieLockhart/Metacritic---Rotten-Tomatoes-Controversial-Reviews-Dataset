Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is just a raw response to what I saw. I loved Luke\\, and some of the fights. Poe is given more which is great. but... \\n\\n*SPOILERS* This movie was weird. The Jedi must end\\, but Rey is now the last Jedi??? Interesting story telling devices for a Star Wars movie. Generally\\, large or unknowable swathes of time pass between movies and scenes. In this one though\\, they back up to revisit the Rey meets Luke scene in order to make it a comedy\\, there's strained Narration that makes no sense (dark side hole)\\, and there's even the same flashback three times from different perspectives... The entire Finn and Rose plot is a huge waste of time\\, also leaving Rose as a huge hypocrite... The ice foxes are about the biggest McGuffin there is... Left wondering why all Stormtroopers don't wear the silver armor that actually protects from blaster fire... Who the flip was Snoke?... Why are there no people in the Star Wars galaxy that run trade\\, build all those normal star ships\\, or participate in other aspects of high dollar economics rather than every rich person being \\\"evil\\\"... Why was Rey so flat as a character... Why was Finn even in this movie... Why was Poe fleshed out only to be told he's practically worthless in all his contributions by his leaders\\, even though they didn't really have any better plans... Why didn't they just kill off Leia when they had the perfect chance rather than give her some crazy resurrection\\, space angel\\, bombastic powers... since when can Force ghosts touch people and summon Lightning... What was the potential of those salt skimmer craft\\, and where did all the Rebellion fighters evaporate to... How did they jump Rey to the Millenium Falcon... How did Rose and Finn survive with no armor among a massive legion of Stormtroopers and have Phasma pop out a random door elsewhere when they got Hyperspace rammed... also\\, trying to hard to be funny with comedic moments rather than pleasantly funny characters... And seriously\\, Dark Side hole???????","true":true}
