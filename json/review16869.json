Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In the end it was a star wars movie. The reason people are giving this bad reviews is because there pissed off that it wasnt episode 4 5 or 6. Its something new and something in my opinion better than the originals. I grew up on the originals hated episode 1 and 2 but 3 was great but people still crapped all over it","true":true}
