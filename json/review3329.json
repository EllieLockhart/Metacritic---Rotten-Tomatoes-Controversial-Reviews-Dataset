Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Being a life long Star Wars fan I was taken aback after my first viewing of the movie since I came in with some preconceptions of what \\\"I EXPECTED\\\" to see in the movie.  After re-watching the movie (several times) I can honestly say that I \\\"LOVE\\\" The Last Jedi.  I don't think the movie is perfect by any means\\, but Rian Johnson not only creates an amazing film he created a Star Wars Movie that was driven by character choices and the consequences of those choices.  Luke Skywalker has always been one of my favorite characters and in each of the movies I learned important life lessons from Luke - A New Hope (Faith); The Empire Strikes Back (Love); Return of the Jedi (Redemption); The Force Awakens (Patience); The Last Jedi (Inspiration).  In the end Rain Johnson will be known as the person who made the Hero Luke Skywalker into a Legend.","true":true}
