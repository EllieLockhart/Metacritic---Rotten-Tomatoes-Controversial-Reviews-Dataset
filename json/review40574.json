Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst star wars film i have ever seen\\, all of the build up from the force awakens has been thrown out the window\\, Snoke is wasted as a character\\, as is Phasma.  The film is beautifully shot and sounds great but that as good as it gets.  The plot (what little there is) makes no sense and the sub-plots are only there to give characters with nothing to do a reason to be in the film.  I will probably never watch this film ever again which is a sad statement as i truly love the star wars franchise.  Rian Johnson should never be allowed near another star wars movie ever again.  Thanks Rian for the worst Star Wars movie there will probably ever be.","true":true}
