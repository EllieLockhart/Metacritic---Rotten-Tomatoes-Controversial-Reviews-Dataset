Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't like it. Story felt it was all over the place. The casino scene I thought was unnecessary and love between the POCs seem trying hard to me. I'm a woman\\, person of color so defnitiely not an 'alt-right' hating on this movie. It's just bad. They also made Luke a cynical\\, scaredy-cat guy when that's totally out of his original character. Poor exit for Mark Hamill","true":true}
