Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's pretty enjoyable if you turn your brain off due to its stunning visuals and action-filled scenes. There's not a lot of downtime for this film\\, and when there is\\, it usually is cut short by humor that is extremely direct and in-your-face\\, similarly to the Prequel Trilogy. The messages the movie are trying to tell are extremely direct too\\, with its\\\" tell\\, don't show\\\" approach to them\\, treating the audience like they're a bunch of idiots. Some of the plot points are non-sensical and invalidate everything that the Original Trilogy accomplished in its universe.","true":true}
