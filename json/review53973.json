Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am confused by the criticisms of this movie\\, aside from a campaign from snowlalke alt-right who were offended by the small band of remaining rebels being deemed \\\"the Resistance\\\"\\, I found this an inoffensive\\, still slightly too safe improvement over The Force Awakens. Major improvements include giving interesting characters more screen time and depth. Poe Dameron went from being mostly set dressing to being a dynamic roguish hero akin to a more idealistic Han Solo\\, with a lot of heart when played up against his fellow cast. Finn's character was reinforced with much needed dimension and his new friend\\, Rose was one of the best additions to the cast. The only gripes I might have as far as characters go\\, is Luke's seeming emotional regression in the time off since Return of the Jedi; though one could argue that events between the film (both pictured and suggested) might explain his comparative volatilty. As far as the plot itself\\, though there were a few trite and tropeish moments marring it\\, and it had the almost characteristic uneven pacing; it opened with one of the best space battles in the series yet; had some of the most devastating and story driving battles overall\\, and one stunning lightsaber battle as one of the stories' multiple climactic moments. I have to wonder if Rogue One was an influence\\, as overall the action felt much more warlike and gritty than any in the mainline series so far. I think the ending was a bit of a letdown\\, for fans hoping this would \\\"be the sequel trilogy's Empire\\\" as some have said in presser's\\, as it wrapped things up a little too neatly compared to the downer cliffhanger of the former; but it still had a sense of gravitas and consequence\\, and still leaves you wondering how the series will end","true":true}
