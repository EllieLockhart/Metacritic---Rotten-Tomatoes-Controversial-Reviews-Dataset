Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I did not understand nor appreciate how Luke was portrayed (completely out of character)\\, painfully awkward slapstick humor\\, Lack of character development (Snoke\\, Fin\\, Phasma\\, Knights of Ren\\, etc.)\\, Carrie Fisher's \\\"Superman\\\" space scene\\, and lack of direction or motive behind Kylo Ren... What is Kylo's end game\\, why is he doing the things he's doing? Anakin had a clear reason choosing his path down the dark side (to save Padme). I don't even get the sense Kylo is necessarily power hungry or agrees w\/ what the First Order is all about.. Luke seemed to be the driving force behind Kylo's actions and now he's gone. It's a weird feeling leaving the theaters this dissatisfied after seeing a Star Wars film\\, however given there is a 56% audience score\\, it's nice to know you're not alone. 1 1\/2 start because it's an action packed sci-fi movie w\/ incredible special effects w\/ poor story telling and character development. Is this the same Rian Johnson that directed \\\"Looper\\\" and \\\"Brick\\\"?","true":true}
