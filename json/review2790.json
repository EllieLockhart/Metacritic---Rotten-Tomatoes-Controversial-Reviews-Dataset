Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful movie. Fans of the original series will hate this movie. There were multiple times in the movie that I thought Robin William's genie would appear suddenly and break out into a musical number.. The treatment of Star Wars lore is disrespectful. This movie's liberal use of force ghosts\\, yoda\\, Luke\\, etc... made the midochlorians concept seem great.","true":true}
