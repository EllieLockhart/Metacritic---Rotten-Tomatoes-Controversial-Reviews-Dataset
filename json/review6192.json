Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney has destroyed our beloved characters. Another movie that doesn't add nothing to the star wars lore. Rey still does not need any training to be as strong as a jedi master\\, and the biggest crime is what they did to Luke. If you like SW don't watch episode IX on theater\\, just don't.","true":true}
