Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to be blown away by this movie\\, but just wasn't. It flowed too hastily and choppily in some areas and dragged on in others; the plot was a bit thin and\\, without giving any spoilers\\, I'll just say that too many story threads came to anticlimactic ends.  Temper your expectations before going into this one\\, and may the force be with you.","true":true}
