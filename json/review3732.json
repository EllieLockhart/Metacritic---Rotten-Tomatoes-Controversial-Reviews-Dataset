Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Better than TFA; not as good as Rogue one.  Too many important characters left without adequate back stories\\, and a bad guy that is incompetent beyond belief.  Not a fan of the Marvelisation either... this isn't Guardians of the Galaxy so lose the constant jokes.","true":true}
