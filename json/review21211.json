Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I watched the movie again today and I'm upgrading from 1\/2 star to 3 stars.  Hmm\\, why would I do that\\, why would I improve rating for a movie that I so despised 2 years ago?  Well\\, simple answer\\, its because I can watch it now KNOWING that it doesn't mean squat!  Its been  \\\"blown away\\, totally destroyed with more firepower than you can imagine.... by the USS JJ Abrams. Thank you dear sir\\, thank you very much.","true":true}
