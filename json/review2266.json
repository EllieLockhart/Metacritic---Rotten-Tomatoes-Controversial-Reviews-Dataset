Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A total disappointment. Don\u2019t waste your money. It\u2019s full of bad acting\\, plot holes throughout\\, ridiculously stupid moments\\, lame attempts at humor\\, undeveloped characters\\, amateur at best editing\\, and recycled\/reused scenes from the originals. It\u2019s a terrible straight to VHS type movie. Toy commercials are more interesting than this waste of time. Kennedy\\, Abrams\\, and Johnson have ruined this franchise. ","true":true}
