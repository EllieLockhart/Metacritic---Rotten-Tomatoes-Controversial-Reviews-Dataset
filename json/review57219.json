Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie could have been brilliant.  I think it probably was for the non-thinking viewer.  \\n\\nYou were meant to find the humour funny.  You were meant to believe that Rey is automatically omnipotent.  You were meant to swallow the heavy dose of SJW scenes.  You were meant to be inspired by the addition of Holdo and Rose.  You were disregard everything you know about Luke.  You were meant to forget all the questions the Force Awakens brings about.\\n\\nI however\\, cannot do these things.  I found the humour to be the wrong tone\\, the SJW was wrong footed\\, Rose was a terrible addition and Holdo was a distraction\\, Luke would never behave in such a manner and I still have questions that were flat out ignored.\\n\\nI would not recommend this film to a true fan. I can guarantee that if you care about the characters from the Original Trilology and The Force Awakens\\, you will be sorely disappointed with this film.","true":true}
