Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi is really well made movie. Pacing issues aside. However it may be a good movie\\, it is a bad Star Wars movie. Since the beginning of the force awakens\\, it has been what two weeks? This movie picks up right after the force awakens and no time has passed. Now for 2 movies of a trilogy\\, of hey have spent 2 weeks tops in this universe. Now they have the tall task of finishing it in one movie.","true":true}
