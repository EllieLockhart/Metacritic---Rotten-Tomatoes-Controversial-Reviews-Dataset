Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Characters undeveloped\\, disrespected the Mark Hamill and the Arc of the Jedi path. No Rhyme or Reason to plot lines and direction of the story. This film is not made for or by Star Wars fan. The Skywalker family has died.","true":true}
