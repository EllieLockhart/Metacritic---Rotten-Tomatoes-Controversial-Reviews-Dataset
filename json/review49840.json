Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yes\\, yes\\, yes! It's not a movie for the faint of heart\\, since it's full of energy and lots of thrills and even seems that you cannot even blink or you'll lose something important. But I loved everything about it! The characters\\, the plot (specially the twists)\\, the main story and all of the alternatives\\, even those who didn't seem important\\, but made everything work out. Plus\\, the female force is strong with this one [yay\\, Feminism!]. For me\\, it's one of the best Star Wars movies ever created and it translates perfectly what I think and feel about this series. I LOVED IT!!","true":true}
