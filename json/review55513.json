Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My review of Star Wars the Last jedi:\\nIn general very nice to view!\\nThe characters have a very nice structure and are played great.\\nThe Humor was sometimes a bit over the top\\, but it does work if you look at the whole.\\nSomething I found a bit worse was the repetitive behavior in music.\\nNormally I love John Williams and the repetition works to a certain point. (mini spoiler: for example the use of the emperors theme at Snoke.)\\nThe unexpected twists really make it a unique film.\\nIn general\\, supper to view!\\nUnfortunately\\, my problem is not with the film\\, but I am a little anxious about the split among fans.\\nWith a score of 57% on rotten tomatoes among the viewers\\, it is the film that has really divided the star wars fans.\\nSomething I did not expect.\\nThat is why Icall this out.\\nLet us argue with respect for someone else's opinion!","true":true}
