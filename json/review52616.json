Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All I can say is how was this script approved. Even if you try and ignore the blatant disregard for any logic whatsoever\\, they absolutely butchered Luke. Who do they think their audience is? They just lost 90% of their fan base by insulting them in every way they could. The title says it all in that the Jedi are gone and with it\\, Star Wars.","true":true}
