Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't know that gravity was a thing in space. How did the bombs drop from the bomber unto the destroyer in space? Leia can survive in the vacuum of space and propel herself with what? Her farts? She was holding out her finger for the force to pull it after all. The lasers firing on the rebel ship during the chase were at an angle...again would that not insinuate gravity. All the rebel commanders were women(cool\\, calm\\,and collective) and the first order commanders were men(angry\\, bitter\\, and conniving). The dialogue was immature. The condescending woman admiral who heroically sacrificed her life and the little fat Chinese chick who saved Finn from heroically sacrificing himself. Yeah......","true":true}
