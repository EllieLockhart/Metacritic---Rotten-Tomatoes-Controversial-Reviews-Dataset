Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was excited and waited a year to go see The Last Jedi. It had become a family Christmas tradition. I am no longer excited about them and will not be going to see them anymore. I hope Disney loses big in the future.\\nI was honestly bored most of the movie. Maybe 15% had amazing scenes. It didn't make up for it.","true":true}
