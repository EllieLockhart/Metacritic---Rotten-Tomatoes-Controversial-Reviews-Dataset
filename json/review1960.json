{"101487":105794,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As much as TFA played it safe by stoking familiar beats and playing to audiences expectations (and hopes) to see familiar faces such as Han\\, Chewie\\, and Leia\\, The Last Jedi overcorrects and Rian Johnson's script overreaches by intentionally subverting expectations and having established characters play against their own type. As a film\\, I disliked so much of the plot dependent upon people knowing just the right thing\\, being just far enough away\\, pressing a button at just the right time\\, or worst\\, not telling anyone anything until it is too late. As a dark turn for a film\\, it also doesn't allow characters to really experience the sorrow of finding out a friend has passed and more so by the end\\, having characters acknowledge that their poor decisions cost many\\, many lives. And though dark\\, it tried so hard to be funny\\, and perhaps my theater going crew enjoyed it and stifled their laughs\\, but there were certainly no laugh out loud moments. There is also an extraneous side plot that slows pace of film. Last\\, the movie loses a lot of credibility by ignoring what has come before it. Sure\\, every director (and in this case writer) should have leeway to make their own movie\\, but by utilizing characters\\, vehicles\\, weapons\\, and just plain \\\"stuff\\\" (including the established physics\\, timeline\\, character traits) an audience member (fan) should be able to expect at least those elements to function as they have in the past\\, in lieu of it being titled a reboot or something else. I wouldn't say NOT to watch it as it is part of the mainstream culture and we are all participants\\, but I would say you don't have to enjoy it. There are plenty of us that don't. And if you don't (or even if you do)\\, make it known so that those with the power to either keep this type of restructuring and reimagining happening know that the general populace desire it or not. P.S. There were some wonderful visuals. I enjoyed Adam Driver and Mark Hamill's acting\\, but I thought Daisy Ridley's acting regressed.","true":true}
