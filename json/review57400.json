Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie unfortunately has to be one of the worst in the Star Wars saga.  It is rife with plotholes and the lead characters can survive the most extreme explosions with no more than a charred outfit.  My kids thought it was a comedy\\, the Leia flying scene even had me burst into laughter at how bad it was.  It has Disney written all over it and lacked any real substance.  Nice CGI and battle sequences though but the only thing missing was the cast bursting into song in the usual Disney way.","true":true}
