Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Story was fine - Could have used about a half hour of editing: battle scenes were overlong; \\\"floating Leia\\\" was completely unnecessary\\, as was the scene with Luke \\\"milking\\\" his dragon\\, casino \\\"chase scene\\\" completely unnecessary - take out those things and you've got a 5-star movie.","true":true}
