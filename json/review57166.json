Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has no plot. Every character is flat\\, and they end doing nothing. Luke Skywalker was so out of character that looked a different character (and even Mark Hamill was angry about that. The Star Wars philosophy has just dissipated This is just a movie when they have ticked a list of Star wars items (including scenes from the empire strikes back and return of the jedi) and have been mixed together.  At first it seemed a big joke to me\\, then it looked like a bad parody.\\nThe movie even resolve the question planned by the previous one\\, nor does anything to do with the original trilogy (in fact\\, it trashes all of it)\\nDon't look here for character development\\, interesting characters or plots. It's just one kind of watch and dispose movie.","true":true}
