Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was very surprised to see the disconnect between the movie critics and the general audience concerning The Last Jedi on Rotten Tomatoes. I\u2019ll be the first to admit this movie isn\u2019t without flaws. But it is very good\\, if not great. It picks up where The Force Awakens left off and answers a lot of questions we all have had. I don\u2019t want to give anything away here so I\u2019m going to keep this short\\, but some things reviewers have been criticizing are absolute rubbish. Yes\\, there are plot holes. But they aren\u2019t contradictions\\, but rather things that you have to assume or imagine because if they explained everything to you then the movie would be much longer than 2.5 hours and everyone would be complaining even more about the movie being too long. The Last Jedi is definitely takes the story in a new direction while keeping the past intact. It\u2019s well worth seeing. ","true":true}
