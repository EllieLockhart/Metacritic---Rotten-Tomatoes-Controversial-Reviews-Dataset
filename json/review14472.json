Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hated it.  I would have walked out within the first hour but I rode with friends.  Last Jedi shits on the Star Wars mythology.  True fans will hate this movie.  New fans will love or think it was ok but it's crap.  I woke up mad.  The story arc of Luke was redirected and shat upon. No longer an ancient myth or legend the Force has been recreated for political and social stances.  Star Wars used to be an escape\\, fantasy with great story lines.  Last Jedi is closer to Phantom Menace than it is to IV\\, V or VI.  Rian Johnson took some bullet points and lashed them together to fashion a story line that labors across a 2-1\/2 hour finish line.  They Disney'd my Star Wars.","true":true}
