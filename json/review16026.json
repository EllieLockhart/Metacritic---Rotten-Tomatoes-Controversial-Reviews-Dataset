{"101487":136335,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a huge Star Wars fan. I know the lore inside and out\\, upside-down and right side up. I loved Ep VII. I really\\, really did not like The Last Jedi.\\n\\nSPOILER ALERT --- IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE LAST JEDI\\, DO NOT READ THIS POST. SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS.\\n\\nSCROLL RIGHT ON BY IF YOU DON'T WANT\\n\\nBIG\\n\\nFAT\\n\\nLAST\\n\\nJEDI\\n\\nSPOILERS!\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nI'm sure I'm forgetting both some positives and some negatives here\\, but here are my Pros and Cons of The Last Jedi.\\n\\nPROS:\\n\\n- Beautiful battle sequences. I loved seeing A-Wings. I loved seeing Kylo Ren pilot a TIE Interceptor. I loved the moment of silence when the ship is split in half. I loved seeing the red dirt under the salt on Cait as the speeders rushed past. The battles were top-notch.\\n\\n- The fight scene with Kylo Ren\/Rey in the throne room was beautifully epic (except for how Snoke died)\\nAmazing aerial and exterior shots of Ach-To (filmed on Skellig Michael in Ireland)\\n\\n- The Porgs were cute\\, if definitely created exclusively for merchandising.\\n\\n- Rey's parents really did turn out to be nobody.\\n\\n- Kylo Ren going fully Dark instead of getting redeemed.\\nThe new dynamic where Hux is subordinate to Kylo Ren\\n\\nCONS:\\n\\n- The pacing felt awkward. The movie was wayyyyy too long and bloated with unnecessary subplots.\\n\\n- I simply did not like Rose Tico. She felt childish in all the wrong ways\\, and I think she was pigeonholed alongside Finn for *reasons*\\n\\n- The entire casino sequence felt entirely too human\/Earthly. Aliens in tuxedos? No. There are no tuxedos in Star Wars. It didn't feel like a cantina scene; it felt like James Bond.\\nThe score was\\, at best\\, \\\"variations on some very good John Williams theses\\\" but had absolutely no stirring moments that captured my heart the way the TFA soundtrack did with its most powerful moments.\\n\\n- Leia. Flying. Like. Superman. No. No. No. No.\\n\\n- Did I mention Leia flying through space?\\n\\n- One more time\\, let's discuss Leia flying through space.\\n\\n- Saw Luke's Force Projection fifteen minutes before it was revealed (no footprints in the salt)\\n\\n- The fact that one instance of Force Projection was enough to kill Luke Skywalker\\n\\n- Luke tossing the lightsaber away as for a cheap laugh when we ended TFA with the emotional cliffhanger of Rey holding it out to him. Would have been better for him to just walk away from Rey.\\nSo much of the \\\"humor\\\" felt forced\\, stilted\\, or actually counterproductive to the emotional gravitas of the film. \\\"I'll Hold for Hux\\\" was the dumbest sequence I've ever seen in my life. The humor was cheap\\, cheap\\, cheap and there was wayyyy too much of it.\\n\\n- The overall tone and writing style of the film felt more like a Marvel film than a Star Wars film.\\n\\n- Snoke literally just kind of toppling over dead after failing to foresee the lightsaber strike against him was anticlimactic\\, to say the least.\\n\\n- (I feel stupid saying this but) shirtless Kylo Ren for the sake of shirtless Kylo Ren\\n\\n- The new Vice Admiral felt wildly out of place\\, both visually and in terms of character. I know why she was there\\, but I disliked her presence and found it jarring. Also\\, droids pilot ships all the time. A droid could have done what she did and the rest of her character's actions could have been undertaken by Akbar (without killing him)\\n\\n- Yoda's Force Ghost was too opaque\\n\\n- Why did Yoda blow up the tree if he knew (and he definitely did) that Rey had already taken the Jedi texts to the Falcon? I'm open to an explanation that I didn't receive. \\n\\n- Yoda's speech pattern was inconsistent and didn't match the \\\"abnormal syntax\\\" from Original Trilogy or Prequels Yoda.\\nIt's been confirmed that Snoke was *not* a Sith\\, so their use of terminology like \\\"master and apprentice\\\" and \\\"complete your training\\\" is\\, at best\\, something needing explanation.\\n\\n- Benicio del Toro overacted his role. The stutter was too much. He was an interesting enough character without a speech tic.\\n\\n- Hux was cartoonish as a villain and implausibly incompetent given his extensive training by his father.\\n\\n- Phasma has now turned out to be the most useless POS character to ever be promoted by the actor in press junkets and have merchandise of her sold. I mean\\, she used a beetle to kill Brendol Hux\\, so that's cool\\, but all we ever saw was foot soldier stuff. And her dying line - \\\"You were always scum\\\" - and Finn's response\\, \\\"Rebel scum\\,\\\" was fan-service to the point of cringing.","true":true}
