Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw Star Wars: The Last Jedi on a Thursday opening night showing\\, and loved it! Everyone is in top form\\, and Mark Hamill gives a hell of a performance\\, as does the radiant Carrie Fisher. I couldn't tear my eyes away\\, nor my ears. John Williams delivers\\, as always\\, with triumphant success. Having tried to keep my review free of spoilers\\, I'll end by saying that this is honestly my favorite film of the year.","true":true}
