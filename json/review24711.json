Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie was so bad\\, I went through the sign up process to post this. Of course box office is going to have great revenue because it has the name \\\"Star Wars\\\" however after everyone has seen the movie they cant stand it. Just a crap movie overall\\, childish\\, all over the place\\, made no sense\\, hard to follow. By far the worst Star Wars move that has come out.","true":true}
