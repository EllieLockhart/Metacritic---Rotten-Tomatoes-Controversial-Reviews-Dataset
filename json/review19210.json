Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's like watching a completely different franchise that has lightsabers and talks about the force.  This new trilogy doesn't have anyone I care for.  Only Luke and Han\\, and the Original Trilogy characters.  Everyone else is expendable and pointless. So disappointed.","true":true}
