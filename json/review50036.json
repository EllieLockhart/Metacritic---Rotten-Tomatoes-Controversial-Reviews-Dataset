Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Zero stars if I could give it\\, but sadly there is no option. I thought Force Awakens was competent and Rogue One excellent\\, almost on par with the original trilogy.\\nThis\\, however\\, was an embarrassment. It fails BOTH on levels of being a movie and being a Star Wars movie. Basic foundations of a good movie are not there - script\\, acting\\, pacing\\, directing. Plot holes are too numerous to count. And finally\\, it literally mocks the universe created by previous movies.\\nSadly\\, I think this is the one that sinks the franchise\\, although Disney will surely milk it dry. Paid critics should be ashamed.","true":true}
