Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars ever made. Truly awful. Full of plot holes and teeming with political correctness. This film should have never left the cutting room floor. Fans should never forgive Rian Johnson for what he has done to the franchise.","true":true}
