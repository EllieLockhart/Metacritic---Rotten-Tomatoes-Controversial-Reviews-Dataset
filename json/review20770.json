Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to like this film. Throughout the movie\\, I kept trying to convince myself that what I had been seeing was 'cool' and 'unique'. In reality\\, this film is a poor continuum of the Star Wars saga. The plot was horribly set up and what has been done to the legacy of the characters from the original is a disgrace. Plain and simple\\, this film is heresy and blasphemy to the Star Wars universe. For two years\\, we had our hopes and dreams about what would occur. Clearly\\, Luke Skywalker would need to save the galaxy from this monstrous villain introduced as the most powerful of all time\\, Snoke. However\\, Luke is pretty much worthless in this film and Snoke has less screen time than Jar Jar Binks in the prequels. There is absolutely nothing to look forward to in the next film.","true":true}
