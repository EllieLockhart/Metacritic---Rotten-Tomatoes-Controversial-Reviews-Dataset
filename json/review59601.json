Aside from the impressive graphics present within The Last Of Us 2 almost the entirety of the game reeks of one giant attempt to subvert fans' expectations.\r\rA simple revenge plot screened by paper-thin characters who undergo very little development throughout the absolute mockery of a story.  Beloved and established characters present from the first entry are immediately made to act in ways contrary to their initial personality to their detriment with zero explanation as to why this had occurred. The attempt to create depth and resonance with the player in regards to introducing new characters is cringe worthy at best.\r\rUltimately\\, this game will be remembered for the story it was attempting to deliver. On that facet alone\\, do not purchase this game and treat the first game as a stand alone masterpiece.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
