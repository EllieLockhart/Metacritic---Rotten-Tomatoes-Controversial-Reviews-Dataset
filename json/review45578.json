Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing. Many of the highly emphasized mysteries from the prior movie are either answered poorly or discarded entirely. Due to this\\, there is very little incentive to become emotionally invested in the plot and mysteries of this movie\\, since they have not proven to be capable of resolving them satisfactorily. Additionally\\, there are several times where something massive and game changing is revealed\\, only for it to quickly be destroyed or become irrelevant. By the third time this happens\\, there is no emotional weight to the scene\\, especially when every serious moment is undercut with a one liner or some slapstick humour.","true":true}
