Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"snoke: not important\\n\\nRey's parents: not important \\n\\nLuke receiving the light saber at the end of ep 7: not important \\n\\nAny questions from ep 7 were unswered or ignored \\n\\nIt mimicked esb in a terrible way. \\n\\nIncludes the Worst SW death of all time.","true":true}
