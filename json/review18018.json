Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think the movie is dramatically underrated\\, obviously not by critics but by the general audience. I found that the movie had some incredible action and effects(which some were saying there wasn't enough of)\\, but also succeeded in not having to heavily rely one bit on a flashy fight scenes. It stayed true to the franchise with constant twists and turns with well thought out storytelling\\,  and what I was most worried about\\, did not end up being just a remake of the empire strikes back.","true":true}
