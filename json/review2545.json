Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A well made film that subverts the audience expectations for better or worse. Rian Johnson attempted something truly courageous by breaking down the fundamental building blocks of the Star Wars universe. There messages of good and evil not being absolute and repetitive failures leading to valuable lesson is very apt for today's world. However\\, the film ultimately tears those ideas apart at the end when legends are reborn\\, and the Galaxy returns to an evil empire fighting a ragtag group of rebels. Great effort but very flawed. This is a very divisive film for many fans of the franchise. I do believe that time will allow us all to see this movie for what it truly is and where it fits into the larger mythology of Star Wars.","true":true}
