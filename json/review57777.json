Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually entertaining: 7\/10\\n-Nice colors\\n-Have to watch in HD to fully enjoy\\n-Clean looking\\nStorytelling: 3\/10\\n-What the hell are the characters trying to do? Defeat the First Order? We don't have any background to how the FO got so strong and how the republic is so weak.\\n-Character development sucks\\, Rey is boring\\, Finn serves no purpose as do several other characters\\, Old school heroes are lame\\n-Lore has been ruined\\, the whole crash into an enemy fleet thing at hyper speed\\, the ships just don't go fast\\, they move across wormholes in the fabric of space and time.\\n-Pointless side quests.\\n","true":true}
