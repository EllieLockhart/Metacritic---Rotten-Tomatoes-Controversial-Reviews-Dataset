Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a Star Wars fan since seeing the originals as a child\\, being kind of disappointed on the cinematic release of the prequels\\, and being won back over by The Force Awakens\\, this latest episode did not disappoint. Excellent space battles\\, brilliant use of elements from the originals\\, emotional\\, stylistically consistent with the originals and also continuing what every episode has done by bringing new satisfying stylistic elements\\, and a story which kept me glued to the screen and I was always a step behind. Deeply satisfying\\, and in my opinion a very worth successor to the legacy. If you are not enjoying Star Wars by this stage\\, it may not be for you. I'm loving it.","true":true}
