Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Basically these writers \/ directors are ruining my childhood.  They basically had a movie with no plot nothing but holes and no answers.  If it wasn't for them basilcy ripping off Empire strikes back and Return of the Jedi in one 2.5 hour movie i would say they never saw star wars. The chacaters are written as if they where someone else.  They took Han last movie and had him do stuff he would never do\\, now they did the same with luke. If you had question from the first movie don't worry they are still unanwsered and seems will always be unanswered.\\n\\nI would call this the worst star wars ever\\, but i am not considering it star wars its Disney Money Wars.","true":true}
