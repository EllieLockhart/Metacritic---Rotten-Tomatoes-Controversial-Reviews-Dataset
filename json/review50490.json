Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"1\/2 star is being generous.  The Last Jedi is a complete mess of a film from start to finish.  There's nothing left to look forward to in the next movie\\, and I couldn't care less about what happens to any of the characters left.  \\n\\nRian Johnson should not be let near another Star Wars movie let alone given a whole trilogy.  At this point Star Wars is dead to me.  I only hope that one day the original trilogy is released in it's original form to re live the excitement of how films should be made.  Story first\\, not CGI first and story never.","true":true}
