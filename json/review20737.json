Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted so badly to love this movie. Even after much thought this movie is a slap in the face to all Star Wars fans. Rian Johnson and Disney has weighed this film ment to be about the Skywalker family with boring characters and pointless subplotes. Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher shine as Luke and Leia. But what they  were given to work with was absolute crap. Leia flying in space\\, really they could have used a different shot to pull this off in a way that wasnt comical. Lukes character is completely ruined. Years and YEARS of waiting and you couldnt give us ONE final lightsaber duel? Im not talking about the fake force apparition you gave us. And now youve killed him off. Most iggregious was the lack of screentime given to C-3PO and R2-D2...this is still their story. Disney and Rian Johnson you have truly ruined Star Wars.","true":true}
