Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"WARNING NOTICE - RT does not count any rating below 1 star calling it \\\"excessive\\\"\\, so remember - the lowest real rating is 1 star! \\n\\nAs for the movie - it was a postmodernist social justice nightmare. It's a mix of character\\, universe-changing plot holes\\, of destroyed potential\\, of idiotic Mary Sues and moronic villains. This movie broke Star Wars finally once and for all. There is no going back from this unless someone does a reboot of Episode 7 and starts fresh. Star Wars is dead so long as the White Slavers of Disney are owning it.","true":true}
