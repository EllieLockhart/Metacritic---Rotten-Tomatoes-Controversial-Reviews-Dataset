Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Extremely disappointing. Lifelong Star Wars fan here\\, born the year ROTJ came out. Another reviewer said that watching this made her long for the prequels\\, and I was amazed to find that I totally agree; (extremely) flawed though those films may have been\\, at least Lucas had a grand vision. Here there are only fleeting glimpses of the old Star Wars magic\\, drowned in a stupefying story whose central crisis makes little sense and which sends the interesting characters from Force Awakens off in bizarre and pointless directions or doesn't meaningfully send them in any new direction at all. Questions raised in Force Awakens are blithely cut up and laughed at in this movie. And god\\, don't get me started on the downright insultingly lowbrow Marvel-esque attempts at humor. The most difficult thing to see was what was done with Luke. In an interview\\, Mark Hamill said his first response on reading the script was that he \\\"fundamentally disagreed with every single choice Rian Johnson made as to Luke Skywalker.\\\" On seeing this film fans of the original trilogy will sadly learn that that wasn't just Mark making fun chit chat with the interviewer.","true":true}
