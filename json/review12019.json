Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely loved this film. The story and character development is great. I can see why some people have criticized the subplots\\, but I think they served to advance Poe's character and set him up to take on a leadership role in the next installment. The alien creatures and planets were different and beautiful. The fight scenes were great. I will for sure be seeing this movie many more time.","true":true}
