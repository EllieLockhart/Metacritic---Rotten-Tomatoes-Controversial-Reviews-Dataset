Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A bloated\\, clumsy behemoth of a film that doesn't respect the rules of the Star Wars universe\\, doesn't care for continuity or deliverance on existing storylines\\, and treats characters like advertisments for action figures. Would have been better as a SpaceBalls reboot\\, not a Star Wars film. Very disappointing. Let's hope JJ can salvage what's left of the saga for episode 9.","true":true}
