{"101487":197169,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Will try to do this short and sweet\\, which this film was neither. To criticize most of what was terrible about TLJ would venture into spoilers so I will point that out and skip the spoilers for now. For background\\, I consider myself an average Star Wars fan; given the choice between Star Wars and Star Trek I would take Trek every time and twice on Sunday (even before this installment).\\n\\n**Star Wars Is Science Fiction\\n\\nStar Wars has never been hard sci-fi\\, and I have never expected it to be\\, but TLJ takes science\\, balls it up\\, and throws it out the nearest airlock. We have bombs....falling on ships....in space. \\n\\nWe also seem to have the fastest collection of ships that can do an identical speed which just so happens to be faster than every bad guy ship ever assembled. Somehow the First Order has also completely and totally run out of TIE fighters that could intercept them. They also can't seem to find a way to jump some ships to the clear destination (even though they could track jumping ships earlier).\\n\\nIt's a contrived plot device and demonstrates linear thinking that you wouldn't expect from the director that made his bones on a film like Looper.\\n\\n**Star Wars Meets The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones\\n\\nTWD and GoT have made a name for themselves partially on their ability to kill off characters. Body count was somewhat exemplified in The Force Awakens to probably one of the most poignant moments in all of the Star Wars films. I was sitting next to a woman for TFA who cried like a baby when Han was killed. \\n\\nWithout spoiling anything\\, there are deaths here; the problem is\\, they're almost entirely meaningless which has happened on both of the aforementioned shows. It's like the much-criticized Season 7 premiere of TWD where it seemed as if the creative team had gotten to a point where they just wanted to get gruesome and try to go for shock value with the kills. The audience reacted harshly to it and\\, judging by the audience reviews\\, so has the audience for TLJ. Here it's like\\, \\\"well JJ killed Han\\, so I have to do something bigger.\\\" \\n\\n**Phony and Contrived Homages\\n\\nThere's a slew of homages to the prior films in here. Again\\, an homage isn't a problem until it becomes entirely contrived like it is so often here.\\n\\n* Throneroom scene from Return of the Jedi\\, an almost total recreation.\\n\\n* Hoth battle scene from Empire Strikes Back complete with the small little ships trying to bring down the big walkers. In fact\\, I thought IT WAS Hoth.\\n\\n* Creature Cantina from Star Wars but\\, this time\\, a casino.\\n\\n* Cute little (CGI) character that appears to have no relevance or reason for being where it is but to show up and do cute stuff.\\n\\n* Luke's Vader nightmare on Dagobah this time with a plethora of Reys.\\n\\n** Speaking of Rey\\n\\nWhere the hell did she go? She virtually disappeared in this film and became little more than a puppet slammed around by Snoke and Kylo with almost no character development at all. It's a transparent attempt to channel Luke from Return of the Jedi except for one crucial point: Luke had made himself into a major badass to face Vader and the Emperor\\, and despite 152 minutes of running time we couldn't seem to find any time to develop Rey into anything.\\n\\n** Speaking of Luke\\n\\nMark Hamill was great in this trying to breathe life into a Luke that is just vapid and brooding. Again\\, this Luke is channeling A New Hope's Obi-Wan\\, doesn't take too much to figure out. The difference is the reclusive and hermetic Obi-Wan leaped into action when called. Luke pouts and broods\\, seems completely confused and with no clue what to do. Despite being The Last Jedi\\, he has totally lost any frakking clue whatsoever about what it means to be one (until a spoiler moment).\\n\\n** Long\\, Contrived\\, Boring\\n\\nI dozed off during this\\, on plenty of sleep\\, after being really excited to see this film that I ordered the tickets months ago. It was boring and easily could have lost 30 minutes.\\n\\n* The whole contrived trip to the casino is little more than a plot device without any plausibility. Oh hey\\, we won't notice this ship leaving the fleet and going somewhere. We'll just so happen to have a honeypot in jail for them though so we can catch them. You know\\, that makes total sense since we're entirely out of TIE fighters.\\n\\n* Just about every scene in the fleet was long\\, dragged out\\, and of little use to the plot. The Poe mutiny was similarly pointless and only seems to be there to build up Holdo.\\n\\n* You could lop off the entire opening sequence of the film and really not lose anything meaningful.\\n\\n** Mixed Performances\\n\\nHamill\\, Adam Driver\\, Oscar Isaac and Benicio del Toro have great performances that are\\, essentially\\, wasted. I don't think Daisy Ridley had much to work with but she seemed pretty robotic and without much development at all. \\n\\nApparently\\, dying before the film is released somehow adds to the reception of your performance because\\, sorry\\, I wasn't feeling it (again) from Carrie Fisher. There's just zero emotion coming from her at all. Your son just murdered your husband and nobody knows where your brother is but you will just be this milquetoast leader of the Resistance? Hamill kept fresh with his career doing tons of voice acting\\, Fisher did not and it shows.\\n\\n** Changes at the Helm\\n\\nI'm pretty certain this installment\\, while it has critics gushing for some unknown reason\\, tested poorly. The audience reviews for this film prove it out. It seems that Disney knew that too and likely asked (or ordered?) Abrams back to the wheel of the ship to finish it off correctly. The mistakes made in this film can't readily be fixed by another one though.\\n\\nThis film is bad\\, easily the worst Star Wars film bad. It's a symptom of trying to stretch too little too thin and getting trying to get cute with yourself in the process. Okay\\, maybe I wasn't short and sweet\\, but neither was this film.","true":true}
