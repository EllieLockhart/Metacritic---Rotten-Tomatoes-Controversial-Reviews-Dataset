Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Best cinematic qualities of all Star Wars films. Story lines were weakest of any SW film. The character development  was very weak and unconvincing. The actors and actresses were excellent but the chemistry between each was in my opinion worse than the original trilogy but much better than the prequels. This should have been a standalone movie and separate from any particular trilogy or saga. Did not have the feel of a Star Wars movie.  Sad. Wasted the character of Luke. I'm not mad because of his death but rather the poor story arc leading to this event. It should have been developed more and happened in the episode 9.","true":true}
