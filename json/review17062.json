Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed The Last Jedi\\, I thought the movie was great\\, I'm not saying that it didn't have flaws but for me I don't understand what all the hate is about and where the people saying this film has killed Star Wars\\, have they all forgotten about The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones\\, Jar Jar Bink\\, Darth Mauls and Boba Fetts deaths and the constant rereleased editions. What I think all those who are hating just want to see what has been done before but will moan anyways if it's done that way anyway.\\n\\nI liked the direction they headed with\\, instead of doing variations of the same characters and the same plot as what the originals and prequels did this film has gone out on its own and I think it really work.\\n\\nWas a great Star Wars movie and just a great movie non-stop","true":true}
