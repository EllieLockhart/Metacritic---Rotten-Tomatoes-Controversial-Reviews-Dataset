Anyways i walked into this game ready to hate it\\, i was hoping i wouldn\u2019t but i \u201cknew\u201d it was going to be bad. First act went by and i loved it\\, i was surprised. Second act had me more interested than the first even. And then the third act came and i hated it while i was playing. I don\u2019t know\\, i just wasn\u2019t enjoying it very much\\, but when the last scene played suddenly everything made sense\\, the whole game came full circle and i just cried all the way through the credits. The more i think about this game the more i love it. I like the third act now and i understand why i didn\u2019t while i was playing it\\, it\u2019s not meant to be something enjoyable and fun\\, which most of the game is\\, even though you\u2019re facing moral dilemmas throughout the entirety of it. The spectacular graphics and playability contribute to make this game a 10\/10 for me\\, i\u2019m definitely replaying it soon. Now\\, that\u2019s my opinion\\, maybe you disagree with me and you hate this game and that\u2019s ok. But the overwhelming hate towards this game in just a few hours after it\u2019s release is not fair and not realistic.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
