Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hate to say this\\, really hate to say this\\, but I have to.  As a die-hard fan who read almost every new cannon novel (around twenty so far)\\, this movie used virtually none of its endless potential.  It became adding pointless characters and virtue signaling to fill plot holes and completely missed the ball on the significance of the Jedi and the force.  I seen it twice just to make sure I'm not crazy\\, but in a galaxy of endless scale and potential they make a short story of a few days into 2.5-hour movie and started the Jedi over with a pointless couple day training seminar.","true":true}
