Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Princess Leia's floating half-death in the deep space is one of the most epic fail in the entire history of cinema. Luke Skywalker's dyed hair and brand new cut just in occasion of his last lightsaber duel could be the second one. Rose is one of the most unnecessary character in entire galaxy after the creation of Jar Jar Binks (God saves his soul) . What a bad acting! What a bad screenwriting full of holes and non sense. What a lack of creativity and rhythm (the exact opposite of the very first Star War). What the heck?! It seems like a dummy algorithm wrote the plot of this movie. More than than The Force Awakens sequel\\, it looks like a Mal Brooks' Space Balls (bad) sequel. Now I'm very worried about what they could have done with \\\"Solo\\\" spin off...","true":true}
