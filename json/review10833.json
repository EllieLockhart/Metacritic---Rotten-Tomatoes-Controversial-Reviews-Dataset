Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Has it's own faults\\, some let downs and the occasional bore moments\\, but it's action\\, drama and visual effects are combined with the story more then enough for the average fan to be considered a reasonable flick. Die hard fans of the franchise will most likely love it.","true":true}
