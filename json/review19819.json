Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a terribly done movie. The plot of the movie was disjointed\\, it had too many characters with not enough time to make us care about them. It had meaningless scenes for what I can only imagine was to increase the length of the movie\\, because it did little to nothing to add to the story. It made massive and controversial decisions to an established universe with rules and laws for what I can only assume was the sake of \\\"Something fresh and new\\\".\\n\\nOverall\\, it had poor pacing\\, a boring storyline\\, scrapped the story of the intro movie\\, added too many characters and explained nothing about them. It was like the writing\/direction of this movie was focused on hating Star Wars and then blaming the fans when it sucked.","true":true}
