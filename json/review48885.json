Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars ever don't go to see only disappointment. If this would be one serial episode I say ok not bad but no its 2:30 hours longest SW with story which can be done in text which normally SW show before movie. Disney wants to make at least 4 episodes. Why this movie take all expectations away there is nothing to look forward to.  BTW it's just copy episodes 5 and 6 so watch originals definitely more satisfying than this.","true":true}
