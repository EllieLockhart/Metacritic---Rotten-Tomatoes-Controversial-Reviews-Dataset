Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great special effects and overall production. This film looks and feels amazing. However\\, the plot and characters are seriously lacking. All of the interesting hooks from TFA are tied up in unfulfilling ways. This leaves little excitement or energy for the next film\\, and makes this film a bit of a drag.","true":true}
