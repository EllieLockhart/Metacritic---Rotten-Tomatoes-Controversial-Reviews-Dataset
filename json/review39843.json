Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a story that grew up. Essentially\\, we are dealing with the idea that after the rebellion we still have people.  Not hero's.  People who are fallible\\, who having made mistakes are now trying to come to grips with the consequences of those mistakes and are still despite it all trying to do what is right. That is a hard concept to bring to the big screen in a space opera. And the resulting audience score reflects this.  People feel betrayed by the idea that their hero's may be flawed. And this is showing in the scores.","true":true}
