Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Infuriatingly bad. \\n\\nThis movie seems to be a vehicle for the director and the disney execs to push a political agenda while trampling everything that was interesting about star wars.\\n\\nThe plot dispenses with every thread created in the force awakens\\, and ignores the existence of previous films\\, established themes or characters\\, including the motivations and menace of the empire\\, first order the rebels and the key characters the franchise is built on.\\n\\nNice graphics\\, that's it.\\n\\nThe plot is willfully weak\\, no explanation or back story of key characters\\, those that get a little ie: luke\\, are treated with disdain\\, made into idiots or cowards\\, ignoring the entire premise of who these people are.\\n\\nAll the male characters are bumbling fools in this movie\\, and constantly told so by the female characters\\, who I think are supposed to be seen as strong but instead\\, can simply do everything for no reason and with no training\\, yet make super bad decisions with no goal in mind other than apparently teaching lessons to the stupid men?\\n\\nThere is no menace from the first order apart from a few seconds of snoke\\, who looks almost like he is going to grow into a real classic powerful villan\\, who seems almost like he is about to give us some insight into who he is\\, where he came from\\, why he is so powerful etc. . . .but no\\, then he is killed like he is nothing\\, without developing the story line at all.\\n\\nThe first order is more powerful than they were in the force awakens\\, why? no explanation. No setbacks from having lost starkiller base\\, they now reign apparently. we know this because the opening scroll tells us\\, not because it is demonstrated anywhere\\, no lived in universe\\, no time has passed to show us that they are in control and that there is a reason to fight them.\\n\\nThe force is treated as a mcguffin\\, it can do anything\\, anyone can use it\\, without training\\, to do whatever is needed. a joke \\n\\nThe Fin and Rose story arc is shockly contrived and poorly written\\, it removes all urgency as the characters dont seem to focus at all on the peril of their friends\\, but then again\\, heroism is bad in this film anyway\\, so maybe thats the point? They run off to casino world\\, and then spend a huge amount of time making political points on animal rights and rich people benefiting off poor people and so on.\\n\\nother plot points ruin the universe and the premise of star wars in general\\, they weaponise hyperspace\\, now any ship can destroy an entire fleet\\, why exactly was the empire a threat\\, why would starkiller base or the death star be a significant threat?\\n\\nThis is a terrible movie for so many reasons\\, I could go on\\, but its depressing. Plot\\, Story\\, Characters we care about\\, struggle\\, real struggle to achieve power\\, reasons for wanting it\\, backstory\\, motivations\\, character consistency and development\\, this movie has none.","true":true}
