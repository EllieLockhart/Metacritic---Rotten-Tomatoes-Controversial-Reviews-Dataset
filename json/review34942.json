Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film just did not do it for me - mainly because nothing really changes for the characters from beginning to end. You could essentially skip this film and go straight to Episode 9 without missing much.","true":true}
