Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"part one was interesting\\, mysterious\\, and engaging. This one... has confusing plot\\, bad comedy\\, and an over all failure. There's no storyline; although its an extra long movie... nothing makes sense. Its basically a bunch of missing unrelated scenes put together trying to create something... but ended up making nothing. This is the worst Star Wars movie so far. Complete failure. Because of this epic fail\\, I have no interest in watching the next one. ","true":true}
