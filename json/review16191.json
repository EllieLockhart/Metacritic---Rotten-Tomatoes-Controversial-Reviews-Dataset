Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Im happy that they have women in leading roles. The movie is just so incredibly AWFUL. its like it was written by an alien that has no idea what motivates peoples actions. Luke is a crazy old man who wants to kill his nephew in his sleep over a feeling. one star because the movie looks ok. everything else is a waste of time.","true":true}
