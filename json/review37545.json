Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There have been articles from respected news outlets explaining away this film's negative reviews as the work of Russian bots. That should give you an idea of the quagmire of fan rage\\, culture war\\, and legacy media \\\"clapbacks\\\" we are about to walk into together. Directors of both TLJ\\, and TFA have directly insulted critical fans\\, Disney-owned and Disney-friendly outlets have replied to small Youtubers and accused them of bigotry\\, and the star of the franchise has all but publicly disowned these latest iterations. \\n\\nThe trailer's tagline read\\, \\\"Let the past die. Kill it if you have to.\\\" That now lives on with a mix of infamy and irony\\, as this entry seemed to do everything in its power to kill the franchise that spawned it\\, perhaps intentionally in some hollow attempt by Johnson at a meta-narrative. In seeking to radically avoid fan-service\\, Johnson has gone so far in the opposite direction as to make something genuinely mean-spirited\\, not only toward the fans\\, but in the end\\, toward the Star Wars universe itself.\\n\\nWe get characters behaving in ways not only antithetical to their previously developed personalities\\, but also in ways that seem to mock the once-cherished values they embodied. Luke\\, the bright-eyed farmboy who risked his own Jedi training to save his friends\\, ultimately abandons them and arguably betrays his family after one failure. As fleeing into hiding wasn't emasculating enough for Johnson\\, Luke's last shreds of dignity are traded away for a cheap laugh as the man who brought down a galactic empire drinks green milk from an alien's udder in a grotesque scene.  Leia's feminine strength\\, that organically sprung from her scrappy attitude and endearing sarcasm\\, is exchanged for a more modern\\, scolding vision of female strength . And that's it\\, aside from a few brief bits of nostalgia\\, that's the only characters we're rationed from the original film.\\n\\nThe new ensemble of characters all blend into a morass of one dimensional punch-line dispensers and ticked boxes on Kathy's diversity checklist. I was genuinely waiting for a character with allusions to gender dysphoria to appear. So much has been written on Rey being a Mary-Sue that I've seen multiple articles addressing the term's sexist nature published in the wake of the film's release. The only discernably white male characters in the film are members of the evil First Order\\, which is fine by me cause I liked the Empire as a kid growing up. I guess it never occurred to Abrams or Johnson that they might inspire a new generation of white kids to identify with a fascistic order resurrecting a dying Empire to overthrow a multicultural democracy. WHOOPS! Speaking of which\\, Kylo Ren is the only stand-out performance in either film. He works with what little he is given in the script to develop a character that seems to suffer internal conflict and have a genuine investment in the outcome of the story. I'm still trying to figure out why a Rey\\, a scavenger from a planet in the Outer Rim\\, cares who's running the galaxy. \\n\\nSpeaking of story\\, this film manages to make so much happen for absolutely no reason\\, that if it wasn't so clearly the result of incompetence\\, it would be a genuine post-modern achievement. The backbone of the narrative is a chase between space-crafts that's premise is so technically defunct as to leave even a scientific layman confused as to why obvious solutions aren't applied. Star Wars is sci-fi notoriously light on the \\\"sci\\\"\\, but this is 1950s B-movie writing masquerading as a plot in a 2017 blockbuster. Ed Wood has written more scientifically-sound scripts. There's a side-plot that brings the whimsical subject of arms-dealing to Star Wars\\, because who doesn't want to dwell on the military industrial complex while enjoying a fantastical setting from childhood? There's not much else to go into without going overboard on spoilers\\, just the few interesting threads set up by Abrams in TFA being ruthlessly severed. \\n\\nA lot of mainstream critics have called people like me and the other reviewers here many names\\, saying we're acting as if the franchise belongs to only us\\, as if they're handing it off to some marginalized group or another. This would maybe hold water if I saw those groups latching onto and enjoying this new version of Star Wars\\, but the female lead's action figures sit unbought on toy shelves\\, the positive reactions are hard to find outside of canned blog posts\\, and these new characters are utterly forgettable. Disney imposed modern\\, fad politics onto the closest thing recent generations had to a mythology. It's like watching a new regime painting propaganda on the side of your beautiful Victorian home\\, and its absurd for mainstream critics to act like we're \\\"crying fanboys\\\" for being devastated by it.","true":true}
