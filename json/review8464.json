Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Finally a Star Wars movie that's not a copy\/reboot of another Star Wars movie. I know that some can't handle it\\, but it's a truly great movie. In the top 3 with V and IV!","true":true}
