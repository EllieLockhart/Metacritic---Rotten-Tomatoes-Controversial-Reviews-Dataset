Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its a slap in the face to fans. Also forced love for new characters. Obviously the fans have spoken. Usually RT critic reviews are lower than audience. Audience score speaks volumes here. \\nIf you know nothing about Star Wars this was a fun film to watch. If you watched the original Trilogy this is garbage. I cant imagine what someone whom watched the original trilogy in their teens and is now in their 50s are feeling. Disgust. Waited almost 40 years for this?","true":true}
