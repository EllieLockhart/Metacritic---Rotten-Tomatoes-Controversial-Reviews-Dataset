Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had high hopes for TLJ but I was completely disappointed. There is no further character development\\, the portrayal of Luke Skywalker is abysmal\\, the story lacks any coherent theme or purpose\\, the strategic decisions by both the Rebels and the First Order are asinine and insult the intelligence of the audience. It's ok to take a story in a new direction and do bold things but make it connect to a story. Honor the previous legacy. Create characters that we care about. I feel a great disturbance in the force. It's as if millions of voices of Star Wars fans suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. Disney has killed Star Wars. The Last Jedi sucks and I've no interest in any future movies with JJ Abrams or Johnson at the helm. I'm going to pretend the Star Wars saga ended with Return of the Jedi (this timeline includes Rogue One because that movie was awesome).","true":true}
