Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie felt hollow from beginning to end. Spoilers.. The opening scene of Luke Skywalker throwing the light Saber off the cliff was symbolic of Rian Johnson throwing away everything JJ Abrams had built with the force awakens. ","true":true}
