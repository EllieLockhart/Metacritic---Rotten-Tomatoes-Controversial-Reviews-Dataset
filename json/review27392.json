Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Out of all the star wars movies The Last Jedi was a film set in the star wars universe but lacked the story that usually goes with it. A movie filled with dissapointment and inconsistencies from the star wars universe that lacked any development in the story. The whole film felt like it could have been improved as it deprived viewers of what they wanted in a disguise of a 'twist' that lacked creativity.","true":true}
