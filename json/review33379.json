Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Taken in isolation as a standalone film this is poorly written and edited. I was bored at the incredulous and lazy script within 10 minutes. I rate it at 2 out of 5 on that basis. However if you are a StarWars fan and\/or want to experience this as part of a bigger story it is even worse. Great actors. Dazzling effects. Beautiful soundtrack. Unique and invaluable legacy of the earlier films (including Episode 7 which was pretty good). All trashed by disastrous script\\, storytelling and editing. I cannot understand how this is even possible. Has Disney just bought the single film franchise with the most potential and trashed it? No coming back from this one I'm afraid Disney....This film has turned most fans and film lovers off StarWars for good. Well done.","true":true}
