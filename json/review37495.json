Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are some many things wrong with this movie \\nLike whats p with superman Leai \\nWhy would the kill off\\, potentially the greatest villain of all time with no explanation. \\nAnd there is no mention of the knights of rea \\nthe only reason Finn and rose had to go on that wild goose chase was because hold wouldn't tell anyone the stupid plan.\\nHow does one person almost single handedly take out a drednout \\nAnd how is Rey so darn powerful with little to know traning.\\nIn every scene there was some sort of comic relief which is dumb.\\nAnd why is plasma so hyped and she plays no role in the movies and they just kill her. \\nHow does the kid at the end even know how to use the force when Luke and anikan needed some much training\\nAnd that is not at a all how Luke should be portrayed in the movie \\nThe force awakens set up this movie to be great but then they completely ignored the potential and hype for this movie and the characters and the plot.","true":true}
