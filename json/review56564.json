Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a fascinating study in how many movie sins people are willing to accept in a blockbuster franchise. While this movie is better then the Force Awakens\\, it's still a far cry from what the franchise was or could be. The obvious pull of marketing towards banality really shines through more then in any of the other new films. I will give them some credit\\, there's is a small semblance of plot this time with some twists\\, unfortunately those twist will actually leave you more dissapointed as they kill momentum\\, leave characters completely undeveloped and major plot holes that will never be filled\\, The science of the Star Wars saga has always been dubious but the lack of explaination or involvement in any previous Movie of the franchise has never been a problem\\, not so with this movie. Fuel\\, never before mentioned in any previous film suddenly becomes a thing to drive one of the story lines. In addition\\, the rebels\\, always out numbered\\, suddenly have tech that is literally WWII comprabable. The lack of explaination of science in any sci-fi is rarely a stumbling block but here the errors are so profound right from the opening scene that anyone with an eight grade science education should be cringing. Character development in the original and even in the prequels were steady and consistent\\, not so now as the franchise has taken the Disney approach to character development\\, which is to say almost none with nothing for any of the villains. There are some cool special effects and some of the story lines are worthwhile. Mark Hammel really is the star of the movie doing a fantastic job reprising his role as Luke. His interactions with Rey are really the only somewhat fleshed out part of the whole move. I'm not saying this is a bad movie and you will most likely enjoy it\\, but I have to completely disagree with anyone who thinks this is even a good movie.","true":true}
