Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The critics reviews are scored unbelievably high. Similar to Dunkirk (beautiful visuals\\, zero character development)\\, the critics get it just plain wrong for TLJ. There a several possible reasons for this:\\n1. The great VFX (best ever in my view) cover up the plot holes for the critics.\\n2. Everyone's (mine included) delight in having a diverse cast cover up the plot holes for the critics.\\n3. The Disney factor. Amalgam of the Disney marketing beast and their power in media.\\n\\nThis film and its scores will be talked about for years and I am sure we will hear the truth at some point.","true":true}
