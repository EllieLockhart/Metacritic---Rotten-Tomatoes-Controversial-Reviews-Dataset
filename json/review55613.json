Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"#notmyluke \\nThis movie could be excellent if it was dealing with new characters in a new canon.  Unfortunately it is not.  \\n\\nThis arc has made the original trilogy's characters and storyline meaningless.  Our old heroes failed\\, the scene at the end of RotJ does not signify victory and hope anymore.  None more impacted than the eternal optimist Luke Skywalker.  If you were going to betray the moral foundation of this character then don't bring him back!\\n\\nFans are not upset because TLJ's new concepts and changes.  They seem mostly upset because of the damage done to the OT story and characters.","true":true}
