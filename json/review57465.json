Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie was so disappointing ... the story is a disaster\\, there was no closing to the various stories that had already been established in the previous movie\\, I feel there were so many opportunities to give the fans what they wanted and in exchange they mocked them\\, it was as if they intentionally decided to prove that they would discard the entire universe created and developed through so many years\\, maybe for people not close to the saga it will be an entertaining movie\\, but for the fans it will simply be a sad farewell to a beloved universe.","true":true}
