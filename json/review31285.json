Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some beautifully shot scenes and while this is a good film it is one of the worst Star Wars films ever made. Luke's story is a travesty. Flying Leia is ridiculous and just unacceptable. The use of the force is confounding. It also felt a little paint by numbers - insert love story here\\, insert action scene here. My half star goes to Adam Driver for his wonderful full performance. The cast did the best they could with a storyline which is basically a big f you to the Star Wars loving audience. Thanks Disney.","true":true}
