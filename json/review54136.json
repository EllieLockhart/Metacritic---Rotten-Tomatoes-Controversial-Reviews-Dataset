{"101487":131496,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-05-20","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed The Force Awakens (a lot!) \\, and was interested in the new characters.  The Han Solo death scene is emotional and had impact.  I loved Rogue One...it had a great\\, diverse cast\\, and K2SO's death scene was also pretty emotional for a robot.....\\n\\nSo when Luke dies at the end of The Last Jedi\\, I was left with a feeling of emptiness...not from the death of the character\\, but from the fact that I should have felt SOMETHING. Anything.  Hell\\, I cried when Arnie's T-800 died at the end of T2...I felt sad when Chappie gets beaten by street punks in Chappie....\\n\\nSo why did I feel absolutely NOTHING by the end of The Last Jedi?  Because it is an utterly awful movie\\, that's why.  You can't tell me that Rian Johnson intended for the audience to feel NOTHING when one of cinema's greatest heroes dies.  \\n\\nIt is badly written\\, most of the movie is completely unnecessary and could have been resolved or avoided simply by having Holdo tell Poe what the plan was.\\n\\nAnd don't tell me that this movie is intentionally \\\"subverting expectations\\\"....it's just really badly written.  \\n\\nIf this movie ploy can be summed up in a paragraph\\, it's this:\\n\\n\\\"Grieving girl runs off to casino with fleeing traitor\\, then prevents him from destroying a weapon (thus negating her sister's sacrifice) \\, and resulting in the death of Luke Skywalker....all because she was a little bit sadface and felt attracted to a stranger while experiencing grief\\\".\\n\\nWho the hell is rating this movie 5 stars?","true":true}
