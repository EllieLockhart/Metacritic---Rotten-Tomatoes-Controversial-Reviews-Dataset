Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"far too many subplots. Fins subplot was a massive waste of screen time and too many pointless characters were introduced to add to the boring subplot. More time should have been spent focusing on Ray and Luke. \\n\\nI went into the cinema blind having high hopes but left the cinema flabbergasted with disappointment. These critics are clearly shills.","true":true}
