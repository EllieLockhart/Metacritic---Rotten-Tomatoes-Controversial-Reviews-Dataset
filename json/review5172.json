Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Days Of Our Lives meets Spaceballs.  The feminists had their hands all over this one.  The male lead characters were portrayed as disobedient and irrational hot heads which required powerful women to set them straight and save the day.  Let's not forget to satisfy the activists by saving the space horses on a 45 minute sequence that lead to absolutely nowhere.  More plot holes than Swiss cheese.  Purposely created to see if this movie could win the \\\"shock and awe\\\" contest that has taken over Hollywood in regards to plot twists and surprises.  This movie is terrible!","true":true}
