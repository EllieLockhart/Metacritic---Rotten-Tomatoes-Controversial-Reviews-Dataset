Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely a mess of a movie. Johnson ruined the Luke Skywalker story\\, putrid at best. First Star Wars movie I will not see multiple times. Still can't fugue out why Disney hates the Skywalker family. Oh and Star Wars isn't Star Wars without a Sith. Dam i miss George Lucas","true":true}
