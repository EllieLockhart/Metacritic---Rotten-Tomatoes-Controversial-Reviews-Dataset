Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian shows no restraint.\\n\\nCouldn't resist putting in every possible joke\\, a pointless Yoda cameo\\, rushed earth-shattering twists\\, and an ending that I still don't really know if I understand. What's more difficult to understand is how there are only 19 negative critic reviews of this tonally deficient movie. I loved Force Awakens\\, but this takes so much potential and throws it back in our face\\, almost mad at us for caring about questions like Snoke and Rey's backstory.\\n\\nWell now I don't care anymore. Too bad.","true":true}
