Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie doesn\u2019t hold to classic Star Wars elements that made the movies so timeless. There was so much potential to do something really meaningful and powerful with Luke and that potential was utterly wasted (literally with him milking an animal...WTH). Let down #1 happens just seconds into the movie with him throwing the light saber over his shoulder....what a missed opportunity. There were too many attempts to mix humor into the movie....overdone for Star Wars. So many plot character elements were very disjointed from the preceding movies. Then the Leia faked death scene and space float was very poorly edited and contrived. She had never used force powers in that way and then all the sudden does and like that and so fake looking ?!?...wth. What a disservice to the beloved character. Having Luke brush his shoulder at the end of the movie was just ridiculous. Star Was is so much better than having to put fads in their movies. The movie truly feels it was made for commercialism rather than holding true to what made Star Wars timeless. It felt so much like Disney sold out in the name of profit and it\u2019s so very disappointing. I have lost all excitement about future movies. I would go see one more movie to see if a different producer can salvage the story....this movie has made that a really difficult task. Quantity over quality=the end. ","true":true}
