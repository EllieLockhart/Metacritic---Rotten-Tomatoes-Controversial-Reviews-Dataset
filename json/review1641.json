Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a massive Star Wars fan\\, I can't understand how Disney let this happen. Between the cringe worthy jokes from start to finish and not getting really any answers from TFA\\, this movie feels like a 2 and a half hour side story\\, more than an part of the Skywalker Saga. Good film altogether\\, BAD Star Wars film.","true":true}
