Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My wife bought tickets to this at a fancy theater with food and alcohol\\, got a baby sitter to surprise me for Christmas.  It took me almost a year to admit to her that it was one of the worst movies I had ever seen.  She knew how excited I was to see it.  I was loathe to disappoint her. \\nBut\\, this movie is a literal spit in the face to the legacy that is star wars.  This movie marked its death.  The agenda is obvious and insulting.  This movie is what you would call emotional abuse.  \\nEvery minute of the 2 1\/2 hour run time is a pain to ingest.  \\nWhen the movie doesn't insult me being a man or being white\\, or having expectations for this series to continue in true star wars fashion\\, the actors and creators take to social media to do it themselves.   \\nIf i were born any other way\\, this movie would literally be Hitler. \\n\\nTo the movie itself\\, over bearing and miss placed attempts at Marvel comedy.  In your face culture politics.  Useless side quests and dialog that doesn't fit the established characters.   Poor leadership which causes a mutiny\\, which is later laughed off.  \\nI could on and on.  But i can't forget to mention the pure disrespect this movie pays to its characters and its audience.  \\n\\nPretending to like this movie does not make you edgy\\, it makes you a sell out.  This movie isn't good\\, no matter where you fall on the culture politics spectrum.","true":true}
