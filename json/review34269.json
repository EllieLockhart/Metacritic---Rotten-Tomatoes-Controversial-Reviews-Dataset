Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The 1st main plot of the movie with the Rebellion is essential a 2-hour \\\"chase\\\" scene. Not even an exciting chase like Blue Brothers or something. The other main plot with Rey is a bunch of pointless dialogue\/imagery that does nothing to answer any questions or progress anything. About 2\/3 of the way through\\, when questions do get answered they are all a giant let down.Who is Snoke? Who is Rey's parents? I won't tell you here\\, but if you see this movie get your expectations as LOW AS POSSIBLE then go lower.\\n\\nAs a last note\\, the sub-mission that Finn goes on? What did this do for the movie? Nothing! If you deleted every minute of Finn's story out of the movie it wouldn't change ANYTHING that happened in the slightest.\\n\\nAnd finally\\, \\\"It's salt.\\\"  Someone wrote that down in a script\\, filmed it\\, and decided to leave it in. The only possible reason I can fathom why that is a line in the movie is so the people who liked TLJ can have a meme to use over \\\"haters crying\\\" about how bad this movie was.","true":true}
