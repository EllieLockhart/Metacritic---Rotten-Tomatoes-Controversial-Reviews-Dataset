Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I watched The Force Awakens in Hong Kong when it was released two years ago. It was a spectacular movie\\, but I left the cinema disappointed because it seemed mostly to retell an old familiar story. The Last Jedi is different. It moves the Star Wars saga forward with creativity\\, surprise\\, heartbreak and suspense. It has so many twists and turns that I need to watch it again. In addition to sizzling special effects\\, there was a depth in the dialogue that I don't remember in any previous Star Wars movie\\, delving deeply into themes of hope\\, disappointment\\, failure\\, and forgiveness. Did any previous chapter have such pregnant moments of silence? After some more pondering\\, I'll be ready for Episode IX.","true":true}
