Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible Horrible Movie. Way to much politics that should not be in a Star Wars movie. This movie divides people where the others brought people together. \\nHorrible divisive film where the moving going nation and die hard fans are fighting against each other. And the filmmakers are saying it's a good thing! It's starts \\\"the conversation\\\" ..... NO YOU IDIOTS!!!! IT'S A MOVIE NOT A POLITICAL SCIENCE CLASS!!\\n\\nYOU RUINED STAR WARS!!!!! KATHLEEN KENNEDY AND RIAN JOHNSON --- YOU KILLED LUKE SKYWALKER AND STAR WARS IN 2.5 HOURS. ARE YOU PROUD OF YOURSELVES NOW? \\n\\nI'm a huge star wars far for 15 years since I was 10. I will not be going to see episode 9 and giving money to you people to make this SJW crap. \\n\\nREMAKE THE MOVIE! take out all the whiny politics. Give Luke his dignity back. \\n\\nwow... such a bad movie on so many levels.","true":true}
