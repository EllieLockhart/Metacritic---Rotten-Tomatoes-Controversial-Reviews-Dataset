Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved the movie with one exception... the storyline of Finn and Rose had a weird and very long sequence\\, which it didn't really need. But I loved the bold choices Johnson made for some characters.","true":true}
