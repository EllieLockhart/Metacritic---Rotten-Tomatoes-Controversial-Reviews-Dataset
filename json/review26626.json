Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Okay so the movie isn't bad by any means of movie standards. But any long time Star Wars fan will be really really disappointed with this one. It doesn't ever feel like a Star Wars movie to me for one. 2 Just was not a fan of the story and the path it went down multiple characters who were hyped up were HUGE let downs. 3 Maybe the cheesiest scene in any Star Wars movie imo\\, it involves Leia and without spoilers just know I personally hated the scene. Not because of WHAT she does but how she does it. 4 Rose. I hate her. I hope she dies first scene of episode 9.","true":true}
