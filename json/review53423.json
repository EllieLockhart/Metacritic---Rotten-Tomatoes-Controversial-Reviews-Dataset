Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney Corp. has a formula that they think will work for all of their franchises. The style\\, pacing\\, storytelling\\, miscasting and humor come across as contrived and annoy me to my core. That sarcastic\\, self aware\\, at times slapstick levity doesn't work for me. I'll never understand their  logic for cringe worthy and forced love stories. Film making by committee at it's worst. It's as if there isn't a director on board anymore.  What we love about Rain Johnson was missing in this film. #TLJ felt like a cheap knock off or a fan film. The camera work and shot choices were lack luster and at times confusing. The potential for one off creature merchandising was evident and heavy handed. It has its entertaining moments\\, some nostalgia and glimmers of hope but ultimately I found myself coming up with excuses not to leave early. Loved Adam Driver\\, Daisy Ridley\\, and Mark Hamill. Disney corp. certainly know how to make a buck but lack the skills to make a great film.","true":true}
