Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An improvement on the last film. A good mix bag cast. The force Skype thing a bit weird but paid off near the end in style. Rian Johnson is more impressive a skipper in the spirit of George Lucas but with more humour. I actually am okay with the controversial Leia scene as before I new anything about it I did wonder if being the daughter of one of the most powerful jedi in the galaxy would she just be thrown away like Han in the last film. The one concession is DJ was not as useful in the story as I hoped. A really interesting character fell a bit short.","true":true}
