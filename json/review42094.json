Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie provided a ton of great forward movement and exploration of the force\\, characters\\, and strategic dynamics we've never seen before. It's interesting\\, however\\, that this movie seems to have garnered such a divided opinion. Many complained about how the Force Awakens retread the same ground as A New Hope\\, but in trying new and fantastic things\\, I found many of my friends didn't like the movie as I did. This is a movie I recommend seeing and forming your own opinions about. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute.","true":true}
