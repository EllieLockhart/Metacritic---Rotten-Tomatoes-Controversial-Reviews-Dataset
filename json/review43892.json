Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Though I didn't care for The Force Awakens I was excited that someone other than JJ was directing The Last Jedi.  My hope was soon dashed as the film unfolded before my eyes..  There are too many holes in the story or just bad story telling; what is Snoke's back story\\, Rose and Finn side adventure was horrible and initiated due to lack of communications between officers ill-respective as the plan should had been communicated to everyone on board the ships\\, of course there is the entirety for Luke's story (why did he leave a map to where he was if he meant to dead alone?\\, how does one fade into the force though his inorganic never drops to the ground during this transformation?) .  Of course\\, there are too many political messages in this movie and the producers and director feel a certain entitlement push their agendas.  I am not going to list all the issues with this movie.  On a positive note\\, the visuals in the movie are stunning as is the sound.  For me\\, these two past movies are the worst in the series and I have no hope episode nine will be able to fix the trilogy.","true":true}
