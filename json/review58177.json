Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yes\\, it's as bad as you've heard. Other reviewers have deconstructed the film and highlighted its many flaws so I won't retread the same ground.  \\n\\nBut perhaps I can add this: More than any of The Last Jedi's structural flaws - e.g.\\, narrative and character dissonance - to me the most heartbreaking aspect of the film is its underlying cynicism\\, both in its worldview and its message.\\n\\nIt tells us there is no such thing as good and evil (it's all just shades of grey) and that those who seek moral clarity are on the wrong side of history.\\n\\nIt tells us that \\\"hero worship\\\" is wrong and should be avoided because our heroes (like Luke Skywalker and Han Solo before him) will inevitably fail and let us down.\\n\\nIt tells us that the past needs to be 'killed' because it's useless\\, serving no purpose other than as a lesson of what not to do.\\n\\nIt tells us that anyone can achieve greatness\\, not through hard work\\, effort and sacrifice but through rejecting one's culture\\, traditions\\, institutions\\, and heritage.\\n\\nIt tells us that laying down one's life for another is wrong because that's tantamount to hate and killing who and what one loves.\\n\\nIt tells us that we can learn absolutely nothing about our identity from our parents\\, even though our parents conceived\\, nurtured and brought us into the world. \\n\\nI can't think of a message more antithetical to \\\"Star Wars\\\" - the Star Wars George Lucas created all those years ago (post-Kennedy\\, post Vietnam\\, post-Watergate) than that.\\n\\nAnd it just breaks my heart.","true":true}
