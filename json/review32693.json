Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars the last jedi takes a lot of risks and some of them work and others do not. Kylo Ren is one of the best characters in all of Star Wars in my opinion and in this movie he really shines. Holdo\\, Rose and Canto Bait are 3 things in this movie that feel very out of place in a Star Wars movie. but everything else in this movie is bold\\, epic and an amazing addition to the franchise.","true":true}
