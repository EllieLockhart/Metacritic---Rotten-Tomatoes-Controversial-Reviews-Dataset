Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is by far the worst Star Wars movie yet. Rian Johnson may make things look cool\\, but he is a horrible storyteller. The plot was worthless and was essentially comprised of one giant chase scene\\, yet somehow two characters managed to go to a casino\\, which did nothing whatsoever to move the \u201cplot\u201d along. In addition\\, the director decided it was appropriate to throw in a bunch of slapstick \u201chumor\u201d. \u201cYour mom\u201d jokes don\u2019t belong in Star Wars. From the very first scenes\\, it\u2019s apparent that the sole aim of this film is to subvert expectations. If only as much time and effort had been put into crafting an interesting\\, thoughtful story. ","true":true}
