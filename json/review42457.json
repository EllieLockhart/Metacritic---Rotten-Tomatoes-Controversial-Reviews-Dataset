Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a great addition to the star wars franchise. It did have some flaws such as to many jokes and some of the plot was out of place but If you put aside all those\\, Star Wars the Last Jedi was a amazing movie it is very unique and special because it is so different from the other Star Wars films. This movie does take a lot of risks and in doing that receive better rewards. This movie is HIGHLY UN PREDICTABLE. Ryan Johnson did his own take on the Star Wars franchise with the last Jedi and it was great. All of the actors and actresses did a fantastic job and I can\u2019t wait to see more of them.","true":true}
