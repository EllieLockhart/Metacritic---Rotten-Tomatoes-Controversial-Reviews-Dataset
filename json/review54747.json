Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I see a lot of people here posting the highest scores\\, saying they have been fans since the dinosaurs walked the earth. \\n\\nI'm sorry to sound provocative\\, but know that I don't say it out of spite; You are not Star Wars fans. That doesn't mean you can't like the movie\\, obviously ! I feel the same casual entertainment when I watch the Marvel movies\\, I can rate them as good movies because if or when they break the universe to which they belong\\, I wouldn't know - I am not involved enough in the marvel universe.  However\\, I am clearly not a fan\\, the movies mean no more to me than the brief entertainment they provide.\\n\\nThis is also the case with you and Star Wars. Again\\, I don't say it to provoke\\, but there is just not any plausible way that you could enjoy anything about the Star Wars universe prior to this movie\\, if you think this movie is a masterpiece. \\n\\nThere are many reasons for that\\, but in summary; This movie stands in opposition to everything that was made before it. Not as a plot twist\\, but an incompatiable puzzle piece that won't ever fit anywhere because it was made with total disregard for the other pieces. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi breaks the Star Wars universe. The rules for which was firmly established early on\\, and now there is not just a lack of predictability (nothing inherently wrong about this) but an absolute lack of consistence (tons of wrong about this).\\n\\nIt also breaks the last two characters we had left\\, their characteristics and personalities. It messes with the (relatively) distinct philosophies\\, the conflict between which the whole universe centered around.\\n\\nSo\\, if you think you are a fan\\, and didn't have a problem with TLJ messing with the universe\\, the characters or the values previous Star Wars movies projected\\, then perhaps you should ask yourselves what you actually enjoyed about the universe before Rian Johnson broke it. Perhaps you're a fan of the new trilogy? :) That'd be a more honest standpoint.\\n\\nIn the end\\, Johnson's creation is an abomination. I don't fault the actors for this\\, just the minds in the top that clearly hold no love for Star Wars or its fans.","true":true}
