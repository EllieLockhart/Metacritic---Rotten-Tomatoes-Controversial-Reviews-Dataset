Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only thing that i liked in this movie is Luke. He has changed\\, maybe he had some dark experience that changed him for life. They will explain it probably. BUT This movie has many problems\\, The first is that is not a starwars period. The second is the writing plot holes big as the void left by Aldeeran planet after destroyed by the dethstar. I felt so ripped when the director decided that to become someone you do not need training\\, you do not need to study but need only to watch disney movies...ops i meant other  things but you get the point..etcetcetc.","true":true}
