The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Firstly I absolutely adored the first game\\, probably one of my top games ever.So this game already had huge shoes to fill\\, which probably worked against it in the reviews as the bar was set extremely high. Is this game as good as the first game? I would have to say no. But it stands on its own as a very good game\\, up there with the best of this generation. I will say that the open world aspects of the game were massively overhyped as you only encounter one area where this occurs early on in the game. This was probably the funnest area and I would have liked more of this. Otherwise you have levels which are fairly linear. I also feel combat was fairly overhyped as it is not vastly different than the first game and is not much of an evolution. Combat however is still fun\\, a bit more variety in combat and openness in levels would have made this game even better. Ultimately the game is about mans darker nature and how it corrupts everything around it. This game is especially concerned with exploring the idea of moral grey areas and humanizing ones enemies. In real life there are no cartoonish villains\\, each person has their own rationalizations and motivations and naughty dog wanted to highlight this aspect of human nature. Naughty dog wanted to take you on a journey from hating someone to being able to understand someone. Reflecting all of this internal struggle is the different external factions at war with one another\\, pushed to the brink of survival. The game concerned with asking the broader questions about human nature and what choices we will make in regards to one another. Will we choose to continue on a path of hatred\\, violence and revenge even though it destroys our lives or are we going to rise above those decisions? Spoiler part - Having loved the first game so much it was definitely hard to lose Joel so quickly\\, however I feel it was a natural progression and consequence from the last game. It is easy to justify the killing of cannibals or one dimensional villains\\, but that is not reflective of actual human nature or reality and doesn't provoke any deeper reflection regarding our actions. This game is able to take us on an emotional journey a lot of games do not and judging by its polarizing reception\\, its clear that it was successful at provoking the emotions it intended. Anyone who would give this game zero to one stars is not being reasonable by any stretch of the imagination.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
