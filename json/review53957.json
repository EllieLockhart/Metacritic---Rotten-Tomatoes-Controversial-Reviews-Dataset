Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved the movie. The emotional depth was surprising.  This movie had the best acting I've seen in the Star Wars Saga from the 2 Skywalkers to date.\\n\\nI cannot wait to see how that Luke\\, Kylo and Rey relationship will evolve.  It's probably the 1st truly powerfully intense relationship we've seen in This saga.\\n\\nI loved that Rey chose Light despite everything that happened to her and Ben fulfilling what Anikin wanted to achieve but didn't  - to be the most powerful ruler in the galaxy...\\n\\nThat casino scene could have been shortened but rest of movie\\, the saner choreography & the spaces battles were beautifully crafted.\\n\\n2019 seems an awfully Long wait to wrap up this arc!!","true":true}
