Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a dumpster fire. Rian Johnson shouldn't be allowed no where near a SW movie ever again. The story was terrible\\, the pacing terrible\\, the acting mostly terrible\\, and the direction was terrible. I honestly think this movie is worse than the prequels and in a close fight for last place with the SW Xmas Special. The more I think about this movie the more angry I get.","true":true}
