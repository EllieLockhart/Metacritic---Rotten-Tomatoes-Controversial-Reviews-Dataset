Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"- The movie was very good. \\n- Yes had its weak spots ( Finn\/Rose ) but the was a reason to go to that place - Yes\\, Leia's moment was indeed bit weird but if you can forgive Ray's force use in instance I don't think that bothers much - \\nMovie take an interesting turn\\, which in my perspective was the logical and mature path to choose - \\nLuke\\, Ray\\, Kylo interactions were the most interesting in the movie\\, and the choices they make are the logical ones \\n- And there are AWESOME moments of action","true":true}
