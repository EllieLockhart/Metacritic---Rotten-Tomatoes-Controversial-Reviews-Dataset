Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never walked out of a Star Wars movie and felt robbed and disappointed until this one. Soooo many plot holes! What surprises me the most is that a TEAM of writers\\, producers and a director all agreed on the direction of this movie! WTF?! On top of the plot holes\\, there was tons of extra stuff that was irrelevant to the whole movie. Oh\\, and if you like social justice warrior crap\\, the movie has tons of that stuff too. The only reason it gets 2 and half stars is because it looked cool\\, had some cool fight scenes and it was Star Wars. ","true":true}
