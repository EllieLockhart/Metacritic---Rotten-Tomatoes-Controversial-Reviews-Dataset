Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie made a lot of risky and surprising decisions\\, which was what I was really hoping for when walking into the theater. This movie stands out from the others\\, and I appreciate that they tried being different from the other movies.\\nThe practical effects looked really god as well. I really like the fact that they could have gone ahead and did CGI for everything for less money\\, but they went ahead and created a more organic feel for the creatures\\nAnd the environments were so well developed. I really enjoyed the different scenery and how unique some of the planets were\\, like the salt-covered planet. Really nice work in this area as well\\nStory-wise and plot-wise\\, I think this movie could have done a better job. And there were a few decisions that the director made that I would consider...questionable\\, to say the least. Like killing a particular beloved character without even showing them\\, or giving that character any lines beforehand. A character that\\, sure\\, has little significance and effect on the story\\, but who has become a\\, perhaps unprecedented signature character of the Star Wars franchise\\, if you know what I mean. And also\\, the sub-plot with Finn and Rose just seemed useless\\, and avoidable\\, along with the fact that nearly half the movie could have been avoided if one particular character has just made a rational decision most others would have made\\, but didn't for some reason unbeknownst to us.\\nBut overall\\, the questionable decisions by the director\\, and some of the weird plot holes make up most of what I don't like about this movie\\, and to be honest\\, a lot of it I can overlook\\, because I can understand the reasoning behind those decisions. All in all\\, I really enjoyed the movie\\, and am probably going to watch it again a few times so I can catch everything. This movie definitely deserves a 4.5\/5 rating from me. One of the top three movies in the franchise in my opinion","true":true}
