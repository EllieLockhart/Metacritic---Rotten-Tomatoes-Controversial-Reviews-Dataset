{"101487":102678,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-06-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A mediocre at best Sci Fi film\\, and an abhorrent attempt at a Star Wars film. Completely disregards the established lore and character traits established not only in the OT\\, but in Episode VII\\, which while deeply flawed\\, had redeeming qualities. The Last Jedi's only redeeming qualities are its visuals and its soundtrack. Terrible story. Terrible characters. Terrible set up for a supposed finale to the sequel saga. Everything that was exciting or intriguing about the Force Awakens in ignored or destroyed\\, and there is no tension left going into Episode IX. Rey has proven herself more powerful than Kylo Ren on multiple occasions\\, even though she has no training and earned none of her abilities. Why the hell should I be invested in the conflict going into the next film? I'm not. I'm morbidly curious at best.\\nAlso\\, I have no desire to watch the Force Awakens ever again\\, because The Last Jedi makes all the mysterious moments seem stupid now. Case and point\\, during Rey and Kylo's duel on Starkiller base\\, when he has the advantage and tries to recruit her\\, saying \\\"I can show you the ways of the Force\\\"\\,  Rey says \\\"The Force?\\\" the music swells\\, she closes her eyes\\, gains a new focus and comes back to win the fight. Now ignoring the terrible choice of having your antagonist defeated in the first part of a trilogy\\, this came across (to me at least) as a Jason Bourne type moment. Rey acted like someone who had been trained in the past\\, and had her memory wiped for her own safety. But now\\, thanks to Rian Johnson doubling down on the Mary Sue factor\\, that scene is now Rey becoming more powerful because she hears and then repeats the words \\\"The Force.\\\"\\nWhat a crock of shit.","true":true}
