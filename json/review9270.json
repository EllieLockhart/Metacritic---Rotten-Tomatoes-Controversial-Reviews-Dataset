Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Garbage\\, not sure what movie critics watched but I want to see that one\\, stretched narrative plausibility to infinity and beyond. You didn't need suspension of disbelief to watch this movie you needed to spend 10 years in a re-education camp where they told it was okay for Rey to be as good as a Trained Jedi\\, or several trained Magna Guard. You needed to be waterboarded over the fact that it's 'Nuanced' to have Snoke die in 10 minutes after 3 years of build up and almost no explanation of who or what he is\\, you needed to have your nails ripped off as the idea of light speed ramming was introduced. No scratch that this move trumps all other torture methods. THE WORST STAR WARS MOVIE\\, and considering almost all of them aren't great anyway that is a hard to beat title. This was a pain to sit through.","true":true}
