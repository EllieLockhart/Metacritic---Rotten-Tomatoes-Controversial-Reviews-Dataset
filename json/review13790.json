Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I found The Last Jedi to be a powerful emotional experience. This film was very much a Shakespearean answer to many of the \\\"Kiddie\\\" episodes that had come before it such as Phantom Menace\\, Return of the Jedi\\, and in its own ways Force Awakens. It addressed many long burning questions from other films in the series\\, and it wasn't afraid to shine a light on previous inconsistencies. These answers are going to burn bridges with some fans. So be it. Hamill and Fischer possibly gave the strongest performances of their careers\\, 30 years later\\, in the roles that made them household names. Fitting.","true":true}
