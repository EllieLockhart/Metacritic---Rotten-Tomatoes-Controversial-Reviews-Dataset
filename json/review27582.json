Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall\\, TLJ has a bad story and characters\\, if you are a casual Star Wars fan you might like it\\, if you know SW and the source material\\, prepare for an unnecessary change to what SW used to be! Worst SW movie as far as Story and Character development.","true":true}
