Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Why this movie is dangerous for the true feminists and women in general.\\nIn retrospective\\, after watching this movie\\, we have the possibility to try to understand why Daisy Ridley was casted for playing Rey\\, the first female jedi hero (if we don't count Princess Leia who\\, admittedly\\, never shown to be aware of any force powers until she actually became Mary Poppins in The Last Jedi).\\nFirst of all\\, let's take a look at her phisical appearance while outside the movie sets: gorgeous makeup\\, long flowing hair\\, generous miniskirts which let us actually see her nice legs\\, open shoes with stilettoes\\, low-cut shirts\\, flashing\/bright coloured dresses and shoes. In other words: a woman as we normally see them around. A woman who is not afraid to be a woman and to appeal\\, also sexually\\, the males and the women who watch her. A \\\"normal\\\" woman\\, may I add.\\nLet's take a look at her phisical appearance in the SW movies: her naturally small breasts\\, small hips and butt are further removed from everyone's sight through the use of very tight dresses which never fail to cover her erogenous zones. She does not sport a single trace of makeup. Her hair is tied up. In other word a chastized and de-sexualized\\, de-feminized version of a woman.\\nWhat is the message that Disney\\, or better Kathleen Kennedy\\, wants to convey here?\\nAre they aware that they are basically saying to all women: \\\"Look\\, if you want to rule the world\\, you have to dress like a man\\, act like a man\\, hide the physical evidence that you are not a man\\, in other words\\, you have to be a man\\\".\\nHow bad a role model is that?\\nLook at what Warner Bros did with Wonder Woman. Gal Gadot is a real woman (with ample breasts and hips\\, flowing hair and gorgeous makeup) and she has been casted for playing Diana Prince\\, a very strong and powerful woman in whom almost every other woman in the world can easily identify (and project) herself\\, and who is not afraid at all of showing the world that she is a woman.\\nIn the movie\\, her breasts are evidenced\\, not hidden\\, by her costume. Her legs and feet too. And still she succeeds in portraying the most bad-ass female in the universe.\\nSex appeal is just one of her powers. A very special power\\, indeed\\, since all other women in the world have it.\\nRey has plenty of force powers. Unfortunately she does not have a bit of sex appeal and she has completely renounced her femininity\\, which would have added some depth to her paper thin character. She barely resembles a woman. Why should women identify with her? Why should men feel attracted by her?\\nReally\\, Disney\\, you got confused. Sex is not the enemy and de-sexualizing every character will not lure men and women into the theaters.","true":true}
