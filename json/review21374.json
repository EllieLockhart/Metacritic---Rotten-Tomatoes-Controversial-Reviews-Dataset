Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I will start off with the good\\, great affects some good battles. Now to the bad parts - Too much Slap stick that seem to have taken place\\, the force now seems to be completely over powered in regards of \\\"WE CAN DO ANYTHING !!! as long as we are strong enough\\\" and lets not get started on the superman scene. \\nAll in all good bits yes\\, more bad bits though and the plot seemed kinda pointless. Would rather watch the prequels","true":true}
