We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Summary: Not a bad game\\, but not that amazing either I found that it was basically just a copy of Tomb Raider but with more annoying characters.I thought the graphics were amazing\\, and the sound was also excellent.The big let downs here were the writing\\, combat system and searching for gear.Searching for gear was a huge pain in the arse. Loot isn't obvious and the button to collect only appears within 1m or so of the gear. So you end up having to walk up and down along every set of cupboards in every room of every shop to make sure that nothing as well. You occasionally come across strange items that you can pick up and examine\\, but they don't do anything else.In terms of gameplay I just found the weapon system way too clunky. You'd try to go into stealth mode\\, but instead changed weapons\\, or try and do a quick heal but get stuck there. it also seemed to me that when an enemies bullet hit you\\, you recovered a lot more slowly than the enemy did.Finally just on the script\\, whilst it definitely seemed it was written as SJW bingo\\, the bigger failure is just making all the characters unlikeable. The only characters who were vaguely likeable (Joel and Tommy) are either killed off early on or get very little screen time.I can understand what they were doing with the Abby backstory part of the game\\, but she just comes across as such a revengeful\\, angry character that I just wanted her part to end.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
