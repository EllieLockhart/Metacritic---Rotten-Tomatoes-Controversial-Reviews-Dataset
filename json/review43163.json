Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This review will contain spoilers. This film destroys the Star Wars franchise.  I am sure it is well received by the critics for its dark mood\\, its reality checks and its reference to the lack of moral authority on both sides.  (Such as arms dealers selling to both sides and making equal profit from empire and rebellion.)  Indeed it has much of the dark foreboding\\, moral ambiguity and the bleak outlook loved by critics in any film or series.  The reason many fans of the franchise though do not like it has little or anything to do with the cast.  It is because they have taken a film which was about heroes and villains\\, a tyranny overthrown and the rise of hope and freedom built on sacrifice and determination and destroyed it.  This had a natural end and its message was one of hope and success.  By the end of the franchise the central love story between Han and Leia ends in divorce\\, separation and the birth of the central villain.  Han dies at the hand of his own son.  Luke has become a disgraced and emotionally\/socially damaged individual who see little or no hope and wants all Jedi gone.  He eventually dies in an act of sacrifice but the emotionally damaged Luke is a different character whose journey in the original Star Wars was an almost pointless act.  His desire to see the end of the order which was so central to the series and that everything is the same and what can one person do is the total antithesis of the original series.  Which was all about individual salvation\\, sacrifice and determination.   The empire returns from nowhere and takes over the entire Star Wars world placing all under tyranny again\\, (So what was the point of the first three movies) and the republic is ended with most of the key characters from the original trilogy killed off\\, disgraced or on the run.  The republic then reduced to a meaningless group of survivors all of whom can fit into the Falcon.  In short the uplifting fight against tyranny\\, the journey of heroes and villains and the sheer escapism and joy of the original franchise has been replaced by bleak reality\\, corruption\\, failure\\, tyranny\\, cynicism and personal breakdowns in faith and relationships.  If I want to see that I will watch a bleak soap opera or the news.  A great looking film with some great individual performances\\, but Star Wars\\, I think not.","true":true}
