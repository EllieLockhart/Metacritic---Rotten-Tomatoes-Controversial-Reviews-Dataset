Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The duty of the \\\"last of the Jedi\\\" is its very challenging length\\, which does not always justify itself in the second and a bit exhausting campaign. Some of the narrative arches that sprang in it could have been shortened without harming them\\, and the feeling was that closer editing would have made the film final in the history of the saga. In the meantime\\, the fans and the experts will continue to argue about their nature and their historical place\\, and as always\\, only time will decide where they will eventually settle. But it is safe to say that Ryan Johnson has succeeded in a particularly tough task: \\\"The Last of the Jedi\\\" is not only a unique and beautiful film but also exciting\\, smart\\, surprising and amusing\\, something Irwin Kirschner himself would have been proud of.","true":true}
