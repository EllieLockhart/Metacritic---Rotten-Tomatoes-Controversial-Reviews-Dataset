Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am tired of the angry fans attacking actors\\, and ruining the tone of this franchise. With that said\\, this movie was just not good.\\n\\nI struggled with the slow speed chase plot\\, and I found the answers to the questions raised in The Force Awakens to be hollow and boring. I am fine with films that subvert my expectations\\, but when the answers are all the same (\\\"Your curiosity was misplaced and is irrelevant\\\")\\, I lose interest. I honestly cannot thing of a less interesting way to be reintroduced to Luke Skywalker\\, than having him throw the lightsaber. I get having him be a disgruntled old man\\, but not to the point where he is not even curious who Rey is or what happened to his friends.\\n\\nI actually fell asleep in the theater for this movie which is a first for me for a movie I actually wanted to see. Some articles on the internet  said to watch it again with a new filter because I might have missed the finer details. When I watched it again (at home)\\, I fell asleep again.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi killer any curiosity I had for Episode 9\\, and with all the drama surrounding the franchise\\, I just don't see a way to make Star Wars interesting again (hopefully I am wrong).","true":true}
