Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At best you can say they tried hard to make this an atypical star wars movie.  Well I guess on that criterion they succeeded.\\n\\nThe problem is stories like star wars have established lore that audiences expect to be followed.  By all means add twists (who'd have thought Darth would be Luke's father?) but throwing the lore out the window to be 'edgy' is just poor storytelling.\\nThis is exactly why Alien 3 failed.\\nThis movie would have been better if it did not have any established characters in it at all.  For example set 100 years in the past or the future.  It might have worked on a certain level.  But as it stands this movie can only be seen as an abject failure.  Unfortunately it's probably set the 9th movie up to fail because the narrative train has already left the station.\\nThis movie also says a lot about movie reviewers (and RT itself) if it can get rave reviews.  IT says a hell of a lot\\, and none of it is good.","true":true}
