Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where to start?  When they disrespect the main theme and character of the series\\, how can you expect the movie to be popular?  No originality\\, no new ideas\\, everything about these new movies feels rushed.  Just make more action sequences\\, forget the story\\, nothing new here except the special effects.","true":true}
