Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't watch a single trailer and purposefully kept away from media in order to go into this movie as fresh as possible. What a disgrace. This film was sloppy\\, loosely written\\, and didn't fit the overall tone of the beloved Star Wars movies. Expecy cheap humor and a lousy plot that makes sense in the movie\\, but not the overall arc of the Saga. I wish Disney and Rian Johnson actually knew what we the fans wanted. It seems underdeveloped characters and forced narratives are their version of a great Star Wars film.  I feel sorry I ever spoke ill of the prequels because at this point in the trilogy\\, Gungans wouldnt be half bad.","true":true}
