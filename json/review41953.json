Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This Movie killed my interest in anything starwars to come. i will most likely not bother going to the theater for future starwars movies\\, ill just wait till its on TV or something.","true":true}
