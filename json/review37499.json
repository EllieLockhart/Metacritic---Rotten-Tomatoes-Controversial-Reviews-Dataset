Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are some really great action scenes\\, special effects masterfully displayed\\, and excellent actors\\, props\\, set design\\, cgi\\, and more\\, lets not forget characters and story-lines that everyone wants to see played out. None of that really matters though\\, because its a mess of an addition to the star wars legacy of films.\\n\\nThe movie is worth seeing\\, there are some great scenes\\, but the cringe worthy awkward jokes\\, and strange character development really will leave you at a loss for words. If you like to watch films and don't care about stories\\, then this should hit the spot.\\n\\nIf your a die hard star wars fan\\, or like to think about your films\\, and want to see the legacy of Skywalker\\, and how it all works out\\, this is a nightmare\\, one we will never wake up from\\, the damage is done\\, and we will never again have this once in a life time chance.\\n\\nThis film will become dated\\, it feels rushed\\, but it has some nice action scenes.\\n\\nThe amount of time that it would take to extract everything that didn't make sense in this movie would be longer than the film itself.","true":true}
