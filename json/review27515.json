Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall I think it is an interesting bold direction that excites me to see JJ Abrams to set up for a grand finale but\\, the more I think about it the more I am just a little frustrated that so much of 7 was questions that 8 simply said there are no satisfying answers What's up with the lightsaber and why is it so significant for her force vision? Who is Rey? Who is snoke? Who exactly was the man watching over Rey and did luke send him there? What did luke Learn at the jedi temple? Who are the knights of Ren? Where are the other force sensitive jedi who kylo took from luke? Clearly in rey's vision kylo was killing people in the rain with a red lightsaber and in the flashbacks of luke and kylo he killed his students with the blue one so what was that? How did maz get that blue lightsaber if it was kylos and he was so strong? I feel like JJ Abrams set up a lot of interesting directions with 7 and Rian said my idea is to go in none of them in 8 - surprise!","true":true}
