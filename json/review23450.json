Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved The Force Awakens and Rogue One.  Did not like this movie at all.  Was as bored as I was in Ep I\\, II and III.  Some cool effects and entertaining for kids\\, but complete nonsense for a plot line.  Why can a ship with almost no fuel zip right into light speed.  Why would the escape pods go unnoticed.  Why do bombs \\\"drop\\\" in space.  How does Leia survive in space.  Why is the whole movie a non-nonsensical chase scene in space.  Luke is totally annoying and the island part lasts way too long.  Nothing really stitched very well together.  I'm saying this as just a movie goer\\, not as a star wars fan.  You have to have a plot that captures your imagination instead of one that keeps making you have to think like a 5 year old.","true":true}
