Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie killed my childhood. It undermined everything the OT stood for. The humor did not fit; most of the characters were lame\/unsatisfying; the story had more holes than Swiss cheese; they butchered Luke Skywalker (at least until the very end and by then it's too late); musical score was not memorable.... it was a sad day. I'll watch Ep 9\\, but after that\\, Star Wars may be over for me. And I'll raise my kids on the Legends universe and pretend the sequels never happened.","true":true}
