Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is ruined.\\nWoman characters make no sense. Luke make no sense. Snoke make no sense.\\nIt's disgusting how Desney is trying hard to SW it\\, and push some progressive female bullshit.\\nI don't think i will ever see this movie again. It's just useless.\\nREY IS MARY SUE!","true":true}
