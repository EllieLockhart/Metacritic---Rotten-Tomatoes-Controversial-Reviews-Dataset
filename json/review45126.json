Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unfortunately director Rian Johnson put his will on top of the saga disrespecting everything that had already been done and mostly disrespecting the entire Star Wars saga. The director made an idiotic movie full of jokes\\, bows that were useless and scenes that had no need to exist. The worst director and scriptwriter Lucas Film may have.","true":true}
