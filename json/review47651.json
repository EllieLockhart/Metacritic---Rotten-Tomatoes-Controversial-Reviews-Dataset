Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What you've just released is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever seen.  At no point in your rambling incoherent movie were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought.  Everyone in this theater is now dumber for having watched it.  I award you no points\\, and may God have mercy on your soul.","true":true}
