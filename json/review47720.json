Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When it all comes down to\\, this movie is just bait. It is just an excuse to stick the name Star Wars and yet another cute creature to make money ouf of a movie that I wished had never happened. The fact that Mark Hamill criticized Rian's decision for Luke did it for me. This trash of a movie is unredeemable.","true":true}
