Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have always loved Star Wars... but this is it\\, just so comically bad. A nonsensical plot dragged out to 2 1\/2 hours and filled with Disney smush and bad writing. Say what you want about the prequels but at least they were distinct\\, original and told excellent stories. Gives me a headache thinking that Disney will be making these movies once a year until the end of time-- I want off this ride\\, can we get George back please??!","true":true}
