Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Jar Jar would have been a welcome addition to this snoozer. Wait for it to come out on DVD. A massive let down after what was delivered by JJ Abrams. Hopefully this trilogy is redeemed by him returning for episode IX.","true":true}
