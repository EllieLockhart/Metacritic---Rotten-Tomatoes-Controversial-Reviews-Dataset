Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What an utter disappointment. nothing but ridiculous plot holes\\, characters acting out of character\\, and really bad comedy in both delivery and timing. Just a garbage film. The prequels made more sense than this movie. Episode 1 was better than this movie.","true":true}
