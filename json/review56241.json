{"101487":170184,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-29","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars the Last Jedi is an insult to the Franchise.\\nIn a nut shell it's a bad film with misguided direction\\, lame script and story\\, boring cinematography\\, MAJOR plot issues\\, no continuity\\, major timeline problems ( 1 week\\, 18h\\, 3days... who knows) ridiculous pointless jokes on the level of a space balls parody\\, utter disregard of the star wars universe\\, pointless alien milking scene\\, unnecessary little kids easily using the force on a level Anakin (the chosen one) Skywalker had to train endlessly for\\, a shirtless kylo\\, pointless twists for their own sake. I could go on\\, but if I would have to go into detail the list wouldn't stop anymore.... but it doesn't really matter at this point if it was a Star Wars movie or not\\, bad film making is bad film making (yes\\, the special effects were good and there was one very good shot).\\nWhat makes it a worst-case scenario is because it is \\\"supposed\\\" to be a Star Wars Saga Franchise Movie. Instead it is completely taken out of context of the other seven movies. The Last Jedi is written and directed as if it was a stand-alone\\, when in fact it should be part of the Skywalker\/Kenobi Saga.\\nInstead you get some weird parody mashup of 5th element\\, search for the holy grail\\, Dark Star and Battlefront II with every Mystery every Question regarding the old and new characters built up in The Force Awakens is just literally killed off\\, swiped away with one sentence\\, or declared irrelevant.\\nIn the end this movie leaves one with the feeling that it doesn't really matter anymore. For me Johnson managed to ruin the previous movies including TFA and the one to come with one very badly scripted movie.","true":true}
