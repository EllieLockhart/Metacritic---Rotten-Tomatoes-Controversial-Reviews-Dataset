We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The gameplay is decent it has some interesting stuff yet it doesn\u2019t feel like you are exploring and tends to get boring in a point\\, the story overall is just bad\\, the way they killed joel was simply infamy\\, taking out such a legendary character in a dirty way\\, they didn\u2019t make any justice for the character\\, also abby which is one of the playable characters is completely un relatable like you don\u2019t even know why you should play with it\\, the lgbtiq thing is okay however it feels a little forced but mostly because of the needs of the company to let everyone know how inclusive they are even though no one gives a F about it\\, but it doesn\u2019t affect negatively the story\\, however its not a big deal though the real problem its the main plot and the way they told that story and how they ended it. The ending its just an insult\\, and literally its like spitting in every single thing that the franchise did good with the original story\\, its just outrageous. I don\u2019t recommend you buying this game at all\\, don't waste your money and time on this\\, its not worth it better save up that money for college ps5 xbox series x or other games but not this trash.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
