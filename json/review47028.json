Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a disappointment\\, this was in Ep1\/2 territory.  I liked TFW and was excited continuing to develop the story\\, but instead it feels like a reboot mid trilogy and completely wasting Mark Hamill which acted the hell out of the shitty script he was given.","true":true}
