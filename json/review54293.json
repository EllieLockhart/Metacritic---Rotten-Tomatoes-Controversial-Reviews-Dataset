Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had a bad feeling from the \\\"funny\\\" scene at the beginning when it was like a poor attempt at a Marvel movie. I kept waiting for it to \\\"get good\\\" but it never did. Some great scenes visually (salt planet battle) but not a great movie. Luke was a complete (inapprpropriate word) and for being so remorseful about the \\\"incident\\\"\\, it didn't show when the \\\"face-to-face\\\" time finally came. The Poe\/Rose storyline went nowhere and was uninteresting. The Finn storyline went nowhere and was a giant waste of time. Rey's was ok  until the final reveal of her bloodline. (After countless teasers). You couldn't link her to any of our beloved characters from years past?  Jurassic Park lady takes over.. no explaination. Never seen her before. She earns more screen time than Phasma\\, or it felt like it. The x-wing laying in the water. Teases us that Rey could use the force to raise it during training but no. Just a long overdrawn and nothing\\, nowhere movie. Lacked a sentimental connection that made you love the franchise and wanted it to keep living on through new characters and experiences.","true":true}
