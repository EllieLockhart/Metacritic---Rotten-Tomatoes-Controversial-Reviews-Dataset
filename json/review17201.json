Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really like this movie\\, it's full of bold decisions and feels so original. You can see the growth in many characters\\, specially Poe\\, about leading\\, and Finn\\, about war. Rose is a great character\\, and sends a really powerful message. You can learn a lot about Kylo Ren\\, and why he was a \\\"copy\\\" of Darth Vader\\, a now we can start to see him for what he really is. Rey is incredible\\, and her personality shines much more than on TFA. Luke is much more human\\, and changed a lot in 30 years. But the highest point is the bond between Kylo and Rey\\, which is going to be the key to redeem him in episode IX (because if you think he'll be the ultimate villain\\, you missed a lot of signs in this movie. My bet is Hux.). I love how this trilogy is the most human until now. You get to see the human behind mask all the time\\, the scavenger\\, the villain\\, the stormtrooper\\, even Phasma has her moment\\, Finn gets to see a vulnerability in her. It was all I could have expected and more\\, and I think Rian Johnson did a spectacular job.","true":true}
