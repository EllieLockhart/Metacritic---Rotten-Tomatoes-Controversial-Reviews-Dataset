Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the best live action Star Wars movie I have ever seen. Characters have depth and are much more morally black-and-white than in previous entries. Kylo Ren is an absolutely intriguing villian and the Eastern inspiration present in this movie is very welcome. This is what Star Wars is meant to be in my book. Completely unpredictable with characters that suffer from issues very similar to those in our own world. My biggest gripe with the movie is how side-tracked it can get. Character idealogies still read like poetry\\, so this grievance is lessened. I recommend for fans of film to go watch this. If\\, however\\, you are a big fan of all things Star Wars\\, there's a good chance you won't enjoy this movie.","true":true}
