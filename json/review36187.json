Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was good\\, not great\\, and not horrible.  Compared to the rest of the Star Wars Movies\\, I would put it in 6th place out of the 9 movies (I'm including Rogue One) just above the prequels.  The movie has a lot of action and is visually fun to watch. However\\, the attempts at one liners and slapstick humor kind of ruined a lot of the movie for me.  The last few movies I saw several times in the theatre.  I'll wait for it to come out on Amazon video before I watch this one again.","true":true}
