Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a Star Wars movie for people who hate Star Wars. It is what Luke Bryant is to country music or what Juan Williams is to progressive politics.\\nI am just baffled that so many critics and faux fans are willing to pretend they like this terrible movie as part of a political game played  at the expense of the Star Wars fandom. This movie was made knowing that fans of the original series would not like it; it was a torpedo across the bow of the culture wars; an agent from Orwells 1984 kicking your teeth in and telling you that bad is good; you must like this movie because the women are right and then men are wrong and being a white male is basically a crime against the universe.","true":true}
