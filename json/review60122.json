Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This review contains spoilers!\r\rIts difficult to start writing a review when there is so much to say\\, so let's write about the possitve aspects that we all know about.\rbeautiful scenary's\\, mechanics\\, attention to detail.\rNow \\, as far as story and gameplay \\, what a dissapointment. I want to start by saying I have always supported naughty dog I thought they never made mistakes and they truly cared about the fans\\, clearly not the case here\\, first of all they tricked us into buying a lie\\, they lied in the trailer so we could all buy this game\\, its a different thing to edit footage so it looks like something different but to completly change and put different scenes that is not ok I as a fan I feel extremely hurt.\rNow the problem is not Joel's death as terrible as that was\\, the real problem is naughty dog try to make us feel attachment towards Abby like we did with Joel and Ellie and it became so predictable that nobody bought into it\\, they tried to use the same psycological tricks that they did in the first one\\, they even played the same scenes\\, the scene with abby and the zebra just like joel and the jirraffe \\, they tried to mimic the relationship between lev and Abby with ellie and joel\\, even when abby rescued lev in the end she was like \\\"I got you\\\" just like Joel when he rescued Ellie\\, when Ellie found the musesum and abby the aquarium and there are a lot more scenes you can look at them online\\, I think that is not that Abby's story was bad is just that we DIDNT CARE we were here to see JOEL AND ELLIE\\, thats why we bought the game\\, ok you killed Joel you better make up for it\\, and it was not achieved\\,is not that we (and I mean we as fans who didnt like the game) didnt understand the game\\, I feel its not a difficoult game to understand\\, we get what you were trying to do\\, show us the cycle of violence\\, how Joel was not really a hero and he destryed a lot of peoples lives\\, How ellie was able to let abby go \\, We get it\\, you just werent able to create the same empathy towards a character like you did in the previous I mean we met ellie as a kid\\, we saw how joel evolved as a person and we were with them every step of the way we understood their actions and we cared. now you make HALF of the game about a new character that is just meh \\, not likeable or complex enough for us to care\\,\rWhat yout tried to do and provoke in the player just didnt work and thats where the failire of this game is\\, and after Abby's section of the game was over\\, there was no turning back\\, it was way to streched out \\, you lost the player\\, there was no flashback of the game that would bring us back to care\\, there was only sadness that we  waited for YEARS for this game\\,\rI am extremely hurt by what you did to my favorite game of all time. definetly not worth the money.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
