New enemy types and smarter AI ( for allies and enemies) really gives this game a more strategic and nerve-racking feel.\r\rNow\\, for the big one; the story. Without spoiling anything\\, the biggest thing I can say is that this game shows and handles Moral Ambiguity better than any other piece of media I have ever seen. The way it shows you both sides of the coin is something I wish more storytellers get into. It throws away the terms \\\"good guys\\\" and \\\"bad guys\\\"\\, and leaves you with \\\"people\\\". People who do what is necessary and right for them. It truly shows what cruel acts in an especially cruel world can do to a person mentally\\, and how far hate can push someone to the edge of reason. A tragic story that will elicit plenty of emotions and reactions\\, and one that will be discussed for years to come. Not only does this get my vote for GOTY and the game of the generation\\, it gets my vote as one of the most brilliant pieces of media that has ever been made.\r\rExtra: The accessibility options are also next level\\, so plus points for that. My blind cousin was able to play a video game and for the first time\\, he got as much out of it as I did. These should start a trend for future games.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
