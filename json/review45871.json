Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very\\, very disappointing film.  Plot holes\\, bad writing\\, and more plot holes.  Not one light sabre on light sabre fight...first time ever in a Star Wars movie.  Just so disappointing.  Not to mention what they did to Luke...just so disappointed.  The could've been an epic film and they missed their chance.","true":true}
