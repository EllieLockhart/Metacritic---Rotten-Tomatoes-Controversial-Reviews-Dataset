Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney is milking Mark Hamill's sea cow with this new SW trilogy by poorly repeating the first episodes all over again (Albeit\\, with new tech).

The only positive note was the visual spectacle and the score\\, so I can see Disney's SW becoming a new \\\"Transformers-like saga\\\" under Rian Johnson's leadership\\, which is not necessarily a bad thing... but as Mark Hamill pointed out: \\\"Just because a film makes a lot of money doesn't mean it's a great film\\\".
