Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was Marvel in a galaxy far\\, far away. The tone was not true to any previous Star Wars installments and instead felt like a really long nod to Guardians of the Galaxy. To be clear\\, I wasn't disappointed by the big reveals at the end. I had become desensitized long before any of that hit the fan. This movie lost me from almost the beginning when Poe had his hammed up prank call with Hux and Leia miraculously survived **spoiler**. If this is where Star Wars is headed under Disney ( blockbuster bloat\\, wall to wall action\\, resorting to exposition in order to explain how the upcoming gratuitous action scene  is relevant to the plot)\\, I'm not interested in paying for a movie ticket. Now\\, this movie was on par with most of the other action-heavy\\, funny\\, forgettable\\, convoluted movies that Disney has been mass-producing with Marvel. It just wasn't a Star Wars movie with a discernable 3 act plot.\\n\\nOn top of being a showcase of the recent trend toward blockbuster bloat\\, this movie (in conjunction with episode 7) also had the distinction of completely destroying the legacy of Luke et al. Luke redeemed Vader in Return of the Jedi and then was given the directive to pass on what he had learned. That didn't happen. Leia's work was also completely destroyed. These movies take everything back to the drawing board. I'm sure the filmmakers thought they were being avant garde and ambitious by making things so bleak\\, but they also ended up making a plot hole similar to the one in Raiders of the lost ark: the original trilogy didn't need to happen. Luke\\, Leia\\, and Han changed nothing through their efforts. The Jedi weren't resurrected\\, and the \\\"empire\\\" is still in charge of the Galaxy. Viewers don't need to watch the originals to \\\"enjoy\\\" the new movies because the new movies and characters don't build on past accomplishments.?","true":true}
