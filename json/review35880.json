Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is the ending of the old and the begining of the new. It takes every question you have and shows you the answers dont matter. The story takes you on a ride to finish decades old story lines and make a fresh slate for the finally!\\n\\nLoved it.","true":true}
