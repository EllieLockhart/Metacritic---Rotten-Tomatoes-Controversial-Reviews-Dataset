Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SW:a new hope...it was interesting with new and old characters.new villain.new light saber.new mask.it's an OK movie.\\n\\nSW:the last jedi...lame fighting scene\\,no more badass villain.snoke easily killed by kylo.who is snoke???bad storyline.\\n\\ni thought this episode will be the climax before episode 10.but i'm wrong.this is the worst of all SW movie of all time.\\n\\nlet lucas do the movie.it will turn out much much much more better n great Star Wars movie.\\n\\nrottentomatoes is really a rotten reviewer","true":true}
