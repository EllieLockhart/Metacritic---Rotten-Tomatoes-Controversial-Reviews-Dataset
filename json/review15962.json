Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I made an account just to give my rating. I loooooved this movie so much. I have been floored by some of the negative reactions I have seen on here. I just couldn't let the haters get away with this! I am a lifelong SW fan and have never been more satisfied by a film in my life. Just keep an open mind\\, let yourself get swept up in another fantastic adventure\\, and I think you'll love it too.","true":true}
