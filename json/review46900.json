Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Went in hoping it would be good\\, turned out to be the worst Star Wars film I've ever seen. This mess made the prequels look amazing. The plot seemed to go nowhere for 2 hours\\, the ending completely disinterested me from the franchise as a whole. Absolutely dissapointed and won't be watching future Star Wars films made by Disney. Props to Rian Johnson for ruining the very idea of Star Wars in every way possible.","true":true}
