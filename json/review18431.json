Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is both the best and worst Star Wars movie. Too many plots at once but truly loved it and the porgs. Several things made me cry but needless to say it is worth seeing. ","true":true}
