Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not the best Star Wars movie ever\\, but an amazing movie nevertheless. Great story\\, great character development\\, great jokes. It had a few bad moments but overall it is a huge net positive.\\n\\nI find it amusing how the vast majority of people bashing this movie can't even write a sentence without making spelling mistakes a 13 year old would see. \\n\\nDisney is making a truly amazing job with Star Wars but there is no win: they can't do anything that has been done before\\, but they can't do anything new either. People think that somehow someone will be able to make a movie that makes them feel like they felt when they first saw the first trilogy. Well\\, bad news\\, fellas: that's not happening.","true":true}
