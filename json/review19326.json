Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its not worth to be a star wars movie at all. \\nstory is not in existence\\, characters are acting out of characters. \\nIts a movie for people with no brain in there heads\\, and for star wars fans its even worst a desaster from hell.","true":true}
