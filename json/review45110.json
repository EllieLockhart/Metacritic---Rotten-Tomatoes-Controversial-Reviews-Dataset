Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unexpected\\, with about 3-4 OMG Awesome moments\\, but the majority of the movie was BORING and BLAND\\, almost fell asleep but persevered hoping for just one awesome lightsaber battle\\, but it never delivered!   Even Snoke was a pansy for not seeing that coming\\, and what was that ridiculous moment with Leia\\, awful...\\n\\nDespite the similarities between A New Hope & The Force Awakens\\, I'm greatly looking forward to what JJ Abrams bring with IX\\, and not looking forward to the new trilogy with Johnson directing!","true":true}
