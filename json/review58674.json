What makes it great is the step away from cookie cutter stories of typical games\/shows\/movies.  Anyone can die and the moral conflicts will have you wondering if you're the hero and if you'll get your revenge.  If you must be the hero who get theirs way then this game may not be for you and any other fair-weather gamers. Excellent story telling and character development.  Expansive environment is overwhelming to explore at times and enemy AI is a little lackluster.\r\rNo gamer enjoys having the character you play as swapped unknowingly mid game.  I was so upset I stopped and waited until I got some sleep.  The emotional toll is so real I didn't want to play as the person I should be killing.  While my view of the character didn't change from seeing her story\\, its all a vicious cycle and Joel didn't NEED to kill everyone at the hospital\\, I began to take joy in knowing everything she had was being taken from her while you play from her perspective.  The saddest part was losing Owen\\, who seemed to struggle more realistically with being a good friend and wanting to leave Joel in the past.  His character would of done well in a longer story.  The ending for me was great and satisfied.  It was not about Ellie getting revenge but getting right with herself.  The struggle between wanting to have died for a cure and accepting the love of Joel for saving her was a  real balance Ellie needed to find.  She felt bad for having telling him He should have let her die and felt obligated to avenge his death.  If you don't like the story then go read some books. Not every games story you play should have the exact same story arc outline and meet your character expectations.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
