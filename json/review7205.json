Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Entertaining at a superficial level\\, but much of the plot was inane. There were so many instances where an eye-roll was inadequate for the way all physical rules of reality were ignored. So many contrived stereotypical set pieces that American film makers seem to need. It was a letdown.","true":true}
