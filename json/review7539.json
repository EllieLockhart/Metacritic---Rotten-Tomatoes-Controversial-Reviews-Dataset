Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everyone needs to stop complaining about this movie I personally love the movie It was something different\\, I will say they could of explained the background of Supreme Leader Snoke\\, but then if the directors would of did that people would of complained that the movie is too long. Like people these days don\u2019t know what they want You want something different but then when people get that you still complain. The movie had a great story\\, Good explanation\\, So people please stop bashing on movies That\u2019s why people can\u2019t enjoy movies in this time of era because you have marks that complain too much and ruins movies ","true":true}
