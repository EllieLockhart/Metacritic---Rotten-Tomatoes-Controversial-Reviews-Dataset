Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Made an account to write this review. Huge Star Wars fan. I could not sleep thinking about how bad this movie was. It is a real existential crisis for me. Not because a Star Wars movie was bad. We all knew Disney was driving this thing out of gas eventually. I just wasn't expecting them to drive it off a cliff. I was experiencing one of the worst movies I have ever seen and people around me were laughing and clapping. What is wrong with them? What is wrong with me? Are we not seeing the same thing? This movie is absolute garbage. My only hope for humanity's collective bad taste\\, is that this movie is largely seen as THE WORST Star Wars after it has sunk in and people see it for what it is. The Jedi have died.","true":true}
