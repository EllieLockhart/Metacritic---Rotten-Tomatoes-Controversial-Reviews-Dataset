Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"LIKED\\n*visually breathtaking in places.\\n*Kylo's complexity is compelling.\\n*no Jar Jar Binks.\\nDISLIKED\\n*far too derivative of ESB\\, (and ROTJ\\,) look up soft reboot.\\n*clich?d\\, thinly-veiled social justice politics driving plot.\\n*unnecessarily iconoclastic towards originals.\\n*Luke\\, now a poor old b*****d\\, reduced to sucking the teet of an unnervingly seductive beast.\\n*Rey even more inexplicably powerful\\, actually a disservice to female empowerment.\\n*Too much Marvel-esque humour\\, was expecting that raccoon from Guardians Of The Galaxy to make a cameo.","true":true}
