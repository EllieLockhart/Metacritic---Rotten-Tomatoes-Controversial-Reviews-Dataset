Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a beautifully shot movie\\, but perhaps one of the worst I have ever seen. It disrespects its core characters at the expense of a bad joke. This sets a chain of tonal problems though out the film. No respect for fallen characters\\, and very insensitive to legendary ones. Character development from previous movies is ignored or completely disregarded. Non nonsensical situations occur as a result of other nonsensical decisions or situations. I sets new rules in this universe which completely betrays and ridicules previous rules established in this saga. I tried to watch it a second time\\, and i had to walk out of the theater. Congratulations Brian Johnson\\, you have killed Star wars. I have met people who hate the Star wars  franchise and its characters before. I never expected one to actually direct one of these films.","true":true}
