Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well the good part is that I can't remember better visuals in a movie for a long time. The special effects team deserves double oscars.\\n\\nThe Bad part: Everything else. the plot is all over the place with so many holes it is astounding to think that people were paid money for it. I've never been what people would call a true Star wars fan (I  enjoyed the prequels to an extent) but this just brakes the whole universe with a resounding crack.","true":true}
