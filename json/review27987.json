Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot holes and subplot holes that take up 2 and a half hours instead of answering questions and creating a background story and even worse shames the legacy of Luke Skywalker. Disney Trash.","true":true}
