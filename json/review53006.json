Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lifelong Star Wars fan\\, it's difficult to admit that I did not enjoy this film as much as I wanted to. It's undoubtedly a beautifully directed and acted film\\, but it lacks the universe-building aspects that allow me to recreate battles and scenarios in my daydreams. It's such a self contained film\\, and does some truly disappointing things with the characters that one has to think Rian Johnson doesn't care for the greater Star Wars universe. Nevertheless\\, I'm going to see it again and see if it's better on the second viewing.","true":true}
