Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was FANTASTIC! I can't believe anyone can be a Star Wars fan and give this movie a bad review. It had everything\\, humor\\, action\\, drama. I laughed\\, I cried\\, I wanted to cheer...and often sat there with a s**t-eating grin on my face. Can't wait for Episode 9!!!!","true":true}
