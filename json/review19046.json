Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its filled with alot of pointless sideplots and the payoff for the things set up in episode 7 is really disappointing but in the end its still a star wars movie with great visuals\\, action and characters (for the most part cough cough rose sucks). The Last Jedi delivers a solid star wars film and the fact that the auidience score for this is lower than all the prequels just confuses me. Star wars is still strong and well and im very intrested to see what they do with  episode 9","true":true}
