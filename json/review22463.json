Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Leia can fly survive and fly in space.\\nVillains are a joke and not imposing at all.\\nSnoke and his entire story\\, actually\\, having no story is a joke.\\nLuke and the milk scene\/ his whole dialogue is terrible. (Plus ending)\\nLong boring scenes with nothing of importance going on.\\nRose- wow why did you bother.\\nMain characters with nothing to do and weren't needed in this movie.\\nThe cgi for Yoda\\, just wow\\, awful.\\n\\nI hate so much about this movie. Would not buy into the Disney crap ever again. They destroyed any real story or mystery. Whatever the scores and main media say- this is a garbage movie. \\n\\nMaybe they can bring back Jar Jar Binks to fix it- that's how bad it got.\\n\\nThe list goes","true":true}
