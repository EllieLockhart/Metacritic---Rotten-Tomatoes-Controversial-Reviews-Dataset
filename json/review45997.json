Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually\\, it's good. The story has some plot - twists\\, but there might be too much ideas in this one and i think episode IX should include scenes where they can patch things up. \\nI saw some people hated on it so badly and called it a rip-off or stressed that the writings were terrible and mixed. Although i didn't go into details of those reviews\\, my experience while watching it was ruined for a bit and i could only blame myself. So i would recommend everybody watch The Last Jedi purely as a prequel to The Force Awaken with some of the old characters from the origins showing up then judge it with your own feelings.\\nSome Star Wars fans have attached themselves too much to the old movies that they want the newer ones to capture the feelings without having details from the original Star Wars which is an extremely hard thing to do when it comes to art.\\nSorry if my review is a mess or seems like something that is so obvious (still some people forget that idea).","true":true}
