Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute trash. If your over 40\\, this film is garbage. If your around 25 or under\\, you might like this movie cuz your oblivious to the Star Wars story line. It's one thing do something different\\, it's another thing to do something that doesn't make sense. Number one thing wrong\\, a Master Jedi being punked by a nobody. How did the director think that would be great for a Star Wars movie. At least the Sith Lord was a bad ass\\, he was just caught off guard. And the last Jedi MASTER in the universe is a complete idiot. Again\\, trash movie.","true":true}
