Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is a great movie for its genre. It had all the expected action and it had an interesting\\, layered story \u2014 which is probably why the critics liked it. I don\u2019t understand the user review ratings. I thought the ending was great and some unexpected\\, very interesting story telling throughout. Go see it. You\u2019ll like it. ","true":true}
