Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While I would agree this is not the best Star Wars we have gotten and has some serious problems\\, Rian Johnson took the saga to new heights that no Star Wars film has accomplished. There are great performances\\, plots\\, and surprises that any fan should appreciate.","true":true}
