Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a bot.  Just someone sad to see that my beloved childhood saga with great potential to carry on to future generations has fallen prey to being used as yet another social engineering tool.  That may be the last \\\"Star Wars\\\" (if it was even that) I'll pay to see in theaters.","true":true}
