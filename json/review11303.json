Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly what the hell did I just watch this movie provided littel to no information about anythimg and killed off the two strongest characters. idk what the writers of this arocity were thinking because everyone is waiting on the origins of snoke and they just killed him wth.","true":true}
