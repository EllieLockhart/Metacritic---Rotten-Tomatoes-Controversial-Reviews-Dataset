Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is maybe the worst movie i have ever seen. Not visually\\, but the way it goes out of it's way to destroy and humiliate everything that was once Star Wars. They left the franchise with nothing because Disney wanted to show the world that Lucas legacy means NOTHING to them\\, and that this is theirs now.\\n\\nDo not see this\\, do not ever support Disney again.","true":true}
