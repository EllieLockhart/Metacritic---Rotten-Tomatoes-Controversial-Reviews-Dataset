Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie took me on a wild ride.  Indeed\\, I don't think I've ever gone from so mildly interested to so incredibly disappointed.  The disappointment was only topped by the actual anger I walked out with\\, this movie was just one incredibly obvious social agenda over and over mixed in with the screaming death of my childhood.","true":true}
