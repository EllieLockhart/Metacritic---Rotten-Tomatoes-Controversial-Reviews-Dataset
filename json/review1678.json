Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As an avid and open minded Star Wars fan\\, the film disappointed me. The funny and witty moments were overshadowed by poor film writing and editing of the scenes that actually had more substance and character development. I never thought I would say this but the film bored me and that to me is a travesty!","true":true}
