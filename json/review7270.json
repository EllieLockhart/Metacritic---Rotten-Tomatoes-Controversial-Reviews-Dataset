Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Entire plot beats lifted from Empire and Return of the Jedi. Awkward 'comedy'. 45 minutes of the film is literally a complete irrelevanceand the rest makes no sense whatsoever. Fails at almost everything it sets out to do.","true":true}
