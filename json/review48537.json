Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Won't be seeing the last installment. Other than Luke and Leia\\, there isn't a single character that's grounded. So many Mary Sues and Gary Stus in one movie it's unreal. https:\/\/www.proprofs.com\/quiz-school\/story.php?title=is-your-protagonist-mary-sue\\nAlso\\, I'm a trained swordsman.  I know what it takes to become truly proficient-yeeears. The force isn't like Neo getting fight maneuvers injected into his cognition. Treating the force like cheat codes to prop up a weak character is symptomatic of whats wrong with the franchise. Hipster Millenials raised on Disney channel and bland angsty cultural fast food love it though.","true":true}
