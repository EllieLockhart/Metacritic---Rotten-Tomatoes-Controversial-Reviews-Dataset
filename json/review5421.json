Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite modern marvel humor and social commentary throwing me off a couple of times\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is still a very enjoyable Star Wars movie! With great performances\\, breathtaking cinematography and amazing visual sequences.\\nEven though me\\, and many others\\, aren't 100% satisfied with Luke Skywalker's arc in this\\, there is no denying every scene with him is gripping\\, emotional and amazing. This might be Hamill's best performance in a live action movie. Cried at his final scene in theater\\, which grants it an extra half star.","true":true}
