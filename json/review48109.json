Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the prequels had some bad reviews\\, mostly because Hayden did his job and made us hate his character\\, This movie is just aweful writing and directing. The people who made this don't know anything about Star Wars.","true":true}
