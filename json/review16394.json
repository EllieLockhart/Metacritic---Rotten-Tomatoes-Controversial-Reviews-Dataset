Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm really not sure what to think.  \\n\\nA lot of it wasn't great.  A lot was fantastic.

But I'm kind of more excited about what Abrams is going to do in 9.\\n\\nThis might be the beginning of the end for Star Wars\\, unfortunately.","true":true}
