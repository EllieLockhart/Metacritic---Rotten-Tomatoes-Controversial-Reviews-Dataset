Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For 40 years I have loved the saga though the thick and thin of all six George Lucas films.  I even enjoyed The Force Awakens despite my distaste for the fact that it rendered Luke and the Rebellion's victory moot.  However\\, I was in absolute shock at this film.  It's that bad.  It shows complete disregard for beloved OT characters (obviously Luke but also Leia for that ridiculous space flight sequence)\\, and does nothing to develop or provide additional motivations for the new characters (Kylo and Rey's story was becoming very interesting when it seemed they might join up together but by the end of the movie they pulled back and put them right back where they began in relation to one another).  It either completely ignored what the previous movie had set up in terms of anticipation (Snoke) or deliberately made their revelation anti-climactic (Rey's lineage).  Add in several very blatant doses of preachy social messaging to that as well.  I'm sure George Lucas will play nice and say it's a great film in public and all that but I would not doubt that he's feeling a great deal of vindication right now.  Disney thought they could do it better.  They can't.","true":true}
