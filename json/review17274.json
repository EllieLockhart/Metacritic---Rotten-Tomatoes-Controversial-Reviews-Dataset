Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to like it. It was just too long\\, I thought the jokes in the movie were very distracting. I just did not care about the characters. I liked the direction they took with Luke\\, but they did not go anywhere with it. I just couldn't get into it. It's the same old plot which got very tiring. I have no interest in watching the next one.","true":true}
