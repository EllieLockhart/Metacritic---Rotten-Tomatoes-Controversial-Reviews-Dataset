Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I actually think all of the negative reviews of this one were wrong...I haven\u2019t been a fan of any modern Star Wars movie and\\, like any intelligent human\\, I know Star Trek is far superior franchise\\, but this movie is the best of the modern films. It\u2019s nicely filmed\\, the derivative story was still interesting\\, and it was worth seeing in the big screen. No doubt that the movie was too long and \u201cBen Solo\u201d is a weak villain\\, but this is a Saturday popcorn space serial - no more and no less - and I didn\u2019t feel ripped off. ","true":true}
