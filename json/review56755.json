Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was choppy and almost feels like a forced piecing together. I liked both \\\" Rouge One\\\" and \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" much better...I do think that there were many good parts to this movie and I'm on board with that theme of giving up the old. That's actually a big reason I liked \\\"Rouge One.\\\" It was a solid story on it's own. \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" was ALMOST good to me.  In fact I thought the actors did a good job with what they had. I even liked the actor who played Kylo better this time around. Part of my trouble with this movie was I found it was hard to believe in. It may sound funny since it is FICTION and by nature had fantastical elements. But I can only suspend my disbelief to a certain extent\\, and in ways that are consistent with the world that is being created. And what is the point of telling a story if it doesn't go anywhere? The casino scene is one example but even Rey's story was fruitless and pointless. There was a lot of wasted time spent telling stories that didn't amount to much and characters with God complexes that have way too much power and still can't do anything with it. Just my opinion ??","true":true}
