Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Who is paying for this propaganda? The only reason it made as much money as it did was due to the fact that loyal Star Wars fans weren't going to miss the next installment. The Rian Johnson \\\"twist\\\" that was applied to this episode voids all previous. Mind you this is only a brief or small synopsis of the many things that are fundamentally wrong with this film. (I'm not bashing the actors\\, just the director with his story line)  Answer me this\\, why would the force direct Rey to Luke's lightsaber and eventually to Luke only to have Luke show her his morning routine for breakfast which includes squeezing the the breast of an alien yak(Barry White or Marvin Gaye background music not included)\\, pole vault cliff spear fishing\\, and hikes? Teaches her absolutely nothing while bashing the Jedi order the whole time. Then a 900 year old dead muppet comes along\\, punks Luke\\, and then displays more force power in one scene than Luke does the whole movie. If you can answer just those few questions honestly as to how those things enhanced the Star Wars universe. Really Luke in Star Wars canon is considered one of the most powerful Jedi ever and all he does is force ghost himself across the galaxy and then evaporated into thin air....!?!?!?!?!!! Really. Btw what's up with the Power Ranger battle in Snoke's chamber?","true":true}
