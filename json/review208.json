It certainly feels like you are playing a 90\u2019s beat em up. There is one refreshing moment during the game and it\u2019s when you are handed a gun and you have to shoot enemies from a car\\, as if playing a shoot em up. I wish this game had more of this. Besides that\\, the attention to detail modelling the two cities in the game and the voice acting is astonishing.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
