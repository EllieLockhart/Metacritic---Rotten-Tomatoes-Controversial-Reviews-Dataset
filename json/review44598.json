Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Totally awful fan fiction attempt at a Starwars film. Fanboy idiots who regard anything \\\"Starwars\\\" as religion will try to shout down anything negative about this film just because it has\\, \\\"Starwars\\\" in the title. They'll use words like\\, \\\"bold\\\" instead of ridiculous\\, \\\"refreshing change\\\" instead of nonsense and\\, \\\"brave\\\" instead of car crash! To describe this film. Even the Starwars holiday special had a better story and Carrie Fisher singing in that was more in keeping with her character than what they get her doing in this ridiculous film.","true":true}
