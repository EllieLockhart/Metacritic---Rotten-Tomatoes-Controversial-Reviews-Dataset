Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw The Last Jedi from a bootleg source. There was no way I was going to spend twenty dollars to see this in a movie theater after all of the bad reviews in received from the fans. With that in mind I have to admit the movie was passable enough as a science fiction fantasy movie and not nearly as bad as the You-tubers were making it out to be. But to be honest \\, The Last Jedi is not a good Star Wars movie.","true":true}
