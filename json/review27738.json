Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"People need to grow up and accept that the franchise has grown up too. Was this movie perfect? No\\, no Star Wars movie has been\\, not even The Empire Strikes Back. Are there things about it I would have changed? Yes. Was it overall a well-crafted follow up? Yes!","true":true}
