Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie lacks direction\\, a coherent plot\\, and strong characters. A third of the movie does not need to exist and the movie tries time and time again to get woke. The protagonist faces zero challenges and the ending is a disappointing payoff to a lackluster ride.","true":true}
