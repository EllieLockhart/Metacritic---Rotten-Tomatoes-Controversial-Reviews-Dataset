Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a devoted star wars fanatic and have been since watching A New Hope for the first time as a child. Watching The Last Jedi was the most excitement I have had while watching a star wars film outside of the original trilogy.  The story presented in this film is a unique addition to the star wars story and in every way defied and literally slashed through the unoriginal storyline and events deemed important by Episode VII. The Last Jedi has me excited about episode IX\\, which did not occur at the mediocre conclusion of episode VII. Star Wars is back and The Last Jedi is a welcome addition that finally took some risks instead of trying to please the crowd with the same old thing over and over again\\, while\\, holding true to the customs of the Jedi Order. The Last Jedi explores the Jedi on a deeper note\\, touching upon faults of the Jedi\\, their teachings\\, and it amplifies Yoda's choice to go into exile in episode III due to failure\\, focuses on this Jedi mentality while providing opportunity for redemption. The Last Jedi finally paves a new path for an improvement on the Jedi teachings with the potential of a future order or maybe even something better.","true":true}
