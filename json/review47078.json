Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a hollow shell of what Star Wars was and could've been. I'm done with it as a fan. Full of propaganda and SJW crap. Way to go Disney. Lucas ya shoulda just let it die and lived off royalties.","true":true}
