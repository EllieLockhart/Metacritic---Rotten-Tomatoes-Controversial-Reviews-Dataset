Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie itself was fine-good action sequences and several poignant moments. As a stand-alone or the first movie in Rian Johnson's upcoming new trilogy\\, it would  been very good. As a Star Wars movie\\, however\\, it fell flat. The whole point of the saga is that the movies are all connected with underlying themes; this movie literally tosses them out. Many questions lposed by The Force Awakens were eitiher ignored altogether or answered in an unsatisfactory way. And what's with the jokes? Star Wars always has a campy\\, ironic sense of humor. Parts of this movie were like bad attempts at slapstick. I was very disappointed; not sure what J.J. will be able to do in the next one to clean up this mess.","true":true}
