Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved the film. I thought it was epic. I loved the last scene with Luke. The cinematography was excellent. I hate that some very rabid fans are unfairly trashing the film and causing it to now start doing worse at the box office. I have seen it twice and can't wait to see it again. Great acting\\, great story\\, great production. Just because it didn't fulfill the theories of so-called fans is no reason for the movie to be trashed.","true":true}
