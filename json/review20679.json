Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've watched every Star Wars film more than I like to admit. Each time I've watched this one\\, the less I liked it. I'll never be able to turn away from a movie with lightsabers and force mythology but this is definitely swept into the prequel junk pile to be occasionally muddled through.","true":true}
