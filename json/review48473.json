Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With the abundance of bad choices the movie offers from it's characters\\, the movie makes up for them with the mythos of the force and the chemistry between Rey and Luke as well as good acting from Mark Hamill. Though this installment is a little disjointed between many parts\\, the chemistry\\, music\\, action and performances still offer some reasons to see this installment~","true":true}
