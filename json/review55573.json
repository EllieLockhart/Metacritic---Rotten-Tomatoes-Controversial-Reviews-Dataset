Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not agree at all that the last Jedi honor the Legacy. It show mainly the will of Disney to adapt it to its audience\\, but not try to keep the legacy intact. The countless script holes\\, the lack of epic breath\\, bad character design to create twist for creating twists... At the end\\, the universe seems left dull and empty. It has one credit however\\, to make the first trilogy seems greats starwars movies now\\, even with JarJar. How can you put 91% RT ?","true":true}
