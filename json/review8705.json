Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Flaws notwithstanding\\, Rian Johnson has delivered a tremendously entertaining Star Wars film\\, one that blazes a new trail and offers numerous surprises while still serving the fanbase. Rey's journey is still the core of the film\\, but Johnson finds a better balance between Rey and the rest of the cast\\, so it never feels like anyone is being shortchanged.","true":true}
