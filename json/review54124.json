Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't understand the intense hatred over this movie. There was definitely some things that were lacking\\, Snoke's back story\\, the depth of Luke's and Rey's relationship\\, and I believe there should have been more heroic sacrifice\\, but at the end of the day it was a good movie that I enjoyed. I am a huge Star Wars fan and I admit that the movie did not meet the critics review\\, but it was stylistically different and challenged what we know about Star Wars. People have their own opinions and these movies can't please everyone\\, but people who claim that \\\"this was the worst Star Wars\\\"\\, or \\\"Star Wars is dead\\\" are sorely mistaken. This movie had moments of brilliance that were very memorable and unique in a good way. I definitely recommend seeing this movie.","true":true}
