Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"so much nonsense in this picture. I mean\\, they turned luke into a crackhead and he dies of insolation in the final. lmao.  the movie doesnt have anything.. bad story\\,  lame dialogues\\, no coherence\\, awful characters(TFA succession)\\, nothing. i think TFA was terrible\\, and after seeing this shameful movie i legit lost interest in the SW series. not going to see episode IX. damn arrogant people that made TFA and TLJ.","true":true}
