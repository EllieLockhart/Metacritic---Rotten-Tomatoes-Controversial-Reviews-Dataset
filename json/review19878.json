Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was boring\\, and the effort that was put into the Kylo and Rey fight scene was a mockery to all of the prequel fight scenes\\, especially the one between Obi-wan and Anakin. Luke was not the same Luke that I remember from the originals. I'd say that this movie was worse than The Phantom Menace.","true":true}
