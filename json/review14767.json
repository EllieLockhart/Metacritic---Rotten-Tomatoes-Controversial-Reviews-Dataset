Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have read reviewers say that this movie is very divisive amongst those who have seen it.  I would say it is.  You have one group of people who can  reasonably review and analyze a movie and another group of people who seem to either have no ability to critically analyze  anything or simply cannot accept that their beloved star wars has turned into a michael bay-esque\\, holiday money grab.  Seriously\\, this movie reminded me of Batman and Robin.  The writing was cringe-worthy.  This movie was made for kids to push toys\\, or adults who might as well have had lobotomies.  From bombs dropping onto ships while in outerspace to inexplicable plot \\\"twists\\\" that have no reason or meaning behind them to characters spelling out the most basic and obvious things happening in the movie to cheesy\\, campy attempts at humor to ...etc. etc. etc....this movie just had terrible writing and the actors never stood a chance.  If you like Batman and Robin\\, the Indiana Jones Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\, and any of the transformers movies...this movie is certainly for you and only you.","true":true}
