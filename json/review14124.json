Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you've felt that previous episodes' openings were just not influenced by Crank Yankers enough\\, then this is your Star Wars movie.  \\n\\nI could go on about why I didn't like this movie.  I thought the humor was misplaced.  The dialogue reminded me of Lucas.  And I maybe got goosebumps once which is not nearly enough.  The film just fell flat for me.\\n\\nBut here's the thing.  I got to see Mark Hamill and Carrier Fisher one last time.  And they both were great with what they had to work with.  That's what is so wondrous about Star Wars.  No one can take away that magical feeling that some of us have gotten to experience for 40 years.  I walked out of the theater angry last night.  This morning I felt lucky to see my heroes again even if it wasn't the reunion I was looking for.  That will have to be my peace for The Last Jedi.","true":true}
