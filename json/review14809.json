Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have to say i am responsible for my 9year old to be a fan of Star Wars. He loves luke\\,vader\\,obi.  Took him to see The Last Jedi he liked the movie.  Im just grateful he is to young to realize what a piece of bull this movie is. As for me i left the theatre with an empty feeling in my soul and what a waste of my time. Worst of all is i had to fake smile after for him.","true":true}
