Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I guess Disney mission is not to preserve the legacy and the old characters\\, but more to destroy them. Giving them the most silly ways to die. At least give them a heroic way to die to show some respect.  Disney completely destroyed and disrespect Luke's character and what he represents\\, just because someone personal hate agenda and politics. \\n\\nCaptain Phasma...seriously! Let some of this actors and actress shine and perform. Snoke\\, another joke. Who was he?  Yoda? They went from high tech CGI to the Muppet Show. Bencicio Del Toro...what you guys did to him? Stop making Kilo look like a silly angry kid. \\n\\n If Disney thinks money is everything I guess they forgot the first thing in show business. Fans and audience make the movies and movie stars famous. The movies don't become a big hit by themselves\\, we do make that effects on the movies. I guess is true when people say money corrupts.\\n\\nDisney is famous for killing family members even in their cartoons. They are all into family tragic deaths. I think I will stay with the Old Republic Jedi stories.  Nothing against the actors and actresses in these movies\\, but the writers and whoever is controlling these movies are not doing you any  justice.","true":true}
