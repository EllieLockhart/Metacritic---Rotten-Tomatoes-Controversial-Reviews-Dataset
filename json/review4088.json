Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Brilliant film. Thought it was going to be overlong\\, but there were so many different strands to it\\, and I loved the separate adventures. New characters like Rose\\, were well used.  The only reason I haven't given a full five stars is that I felt there was some shoehorned romance at the end that really came out of nowhere.","true":true}
