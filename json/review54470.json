Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved the awkwardness and the humor. I like that Rian wanted to make it different than the others. But\\, it was done so poorly and it was so much more of the focus than the foundation of the film: The Storyline. \\n\\nIts hard making a middle movie when you didnt write the first and wont be writing the last. But\\, The Force Awakens was pretty basic and left Rian some good tools. And he just seemed to get distracted and try to make it so different that it got too distant into space. Its in another galaxy it seems. \\n\\nFrom the many plotholes\\, to the lack of continuity from the first\\, to the weird middle subplot that ends up being completely pointless\\, and finally the complete lack of lore\\, its definitely a fun movie to watch. But you can't really dig into it beyond the explosions and jokes (and extremely slow chase scene)","true":true}
