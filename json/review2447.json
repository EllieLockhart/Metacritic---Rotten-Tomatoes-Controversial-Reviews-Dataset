Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A VERY good movie\\, that left me in a funk for days. I could have done without the entire Fin\/Rose plot which was a dead end\\, and Luke's arc was gritty\\, gutsy but ultimately unsatisfying for an original Trilogy fan.","true":true}
