Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie made me more cynical.  It was that bad.  TFA wasn't great\\, but I left that movie with genuine excitement for what would come next.  I could not care less about this new trilogy after this.  Like\\, how did this pass through the entire process of becoming a finished film?","true":true}
