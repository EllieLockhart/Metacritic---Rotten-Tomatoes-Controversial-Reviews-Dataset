Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing\\, disrespectful\\, insulting. Star Wars isn\u2019t a comedy and it doesn\u2019t need an agenda. Just make a fun space movie guys. Is it really that hard? But damn those visuals were good.","true":true}
