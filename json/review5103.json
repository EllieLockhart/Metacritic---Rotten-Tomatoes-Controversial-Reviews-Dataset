Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Critics be damned.  They want to review the film by calling out the audience as unable to understand\\, acting as if The Last Jedi is some higher than though cinematic idol that only those of supreme taste can understand.  The truth of the matter is that we now live in a time were the people do understand the language of film and care about what you do when telling a story.  They don't always just want a spectacle to distract them and should desire more than that from films they admire.  The film lacks in substance and that is what is intuitively being reacted to from those who expected a break away from the same old story that Star Wars has been regurgitating.  Here was an opportunity to explore the gray\\, honor the past while moving forward and bring Star Wars to the 21st century.  We did not want a glossy updated look on Star Wars\\, we tried that back with the prequels.","true":true}
