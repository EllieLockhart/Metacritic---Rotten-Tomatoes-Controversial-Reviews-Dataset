We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"(Light spoilers) The gameplay\\, the characters\\, the graphics\\, and the visuals of the game were stellar. The first half had me on the edge of my seat story-wise as well\\, and I was so excited\\, and then we played 10 hours as Abby. Then\\, I saw all of the cheap ploys to try and make us like Abby and dislike Ellie. Have Ellie kill dogs and Abby pet them etc\\, but that doesn\u2019t change the heart of each character. Just because a child calls Abby a good person doesn\u2019t mean she is one. It shifts from a fantastic start to a bunch of cheap shots instead of quality writing. You can\u2019t make an evil hearted villain and a sympathetic one all in one go like that. I saw what they were trying to do and can appreciate it\\, but it didn\u2019t land properly. The game is better than average but doesn\u2019t live up to it\u2019s predecessor story-wise. It often reads like torture porn (I love angst fic and this exceeds the worst of what I\u2019ve read in this field). I wish it was better\\, I really wanted it to be. The first half I was absolutely in love and then it just dipped\\, all the way to the less than stellar ending. I still enjoy the game. Some parts were so fantastic I\u2019ll never forget them\\, and so I can\u2019t drop the game in its entirety\\, but nonetheless I was a little disappointed. I do still suggest you play the game through on  your own\\, but it\u2019s not the masterpiece I was led to believe it was. 3\/5 or 7\/10\u2026 Expand","true":true}
