Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Underwhelming.   It isn't horrible. But it's not StarWars from the 70s. Even the one with jar jar binx was crap. It's just more crap. And they put a lot of money behind it\\, so we're supposed to go bananas over it.  I want my $20 back. I'll wait for Jurassic Park 5. Thanks","true":true}
