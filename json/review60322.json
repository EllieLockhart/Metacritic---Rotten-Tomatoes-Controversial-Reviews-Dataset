Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This is a piece of art. And art is not supposed to make you feel comfortable. It is supposed to have a message that is worthwhile telling. This game is a masterpiece. I say that as a fan and as a trained peace mediator. The game deals with the circle of violence and shows an realistic picture of how grief\\, PTSD and empathy work. It delivers a message\\, I always graved for people to hear. And it delivers it in a way\\, that is so powerful. The fact that so many people complain about it shows that it was necessary to make it. A lot of important art got a lot of backlash at the time. I believe that the haters are on the wrong side of history here.\rI was horrified\\, when Joel died. But I was also proud\\, that Naughty Dog hat the courage to do it. I am so disappointed with a lot of Pop culture that are afraid to take a bold step like that. And in my opinion\\, it was the only logical thing to do. If they spared him\\, their message would have lost its impact and it would have resulted in a mediocre story and a big case of whateverism. If they went for fan service\\, I would forget it in a year. But now\\, I will always remember it. This game triggered so many different feelings in me and just hit the mark completely. I don't think\\, I can describe the value it had for me. Every second of it was perfect.\rThank you Neil and Naughty Dog for creating a game\\, that was not just fun but also had artistic value like no other!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
