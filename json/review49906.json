{"101487":199988,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-11-29","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You don't have to look far to see much more in depth ratings than this one as to why The Last Jedi is a total disaster\\, but I will sum up (some) of the major disappointments:\\n\\nPositives: Looks and sounds nice.\\n\\nNegatives: Everything else.\\n\\nThe director just threw up his hands and said \\\"screw it. I want awful\\, forced\\, inauthentic\\, pointless social justice and explosions\\\" and that's about what you got. The story telling is objectively horrendous. The plot holes are gaping and numerous. It's truly a shame that they so thouroughly ruined what had the potential to be a grest film with inane descion making and pointless \\\"gotchya\\\"s.\\n\\n\\nEtc... etc... etc... I suggest you watch any number of you tube videos on the subject as to why this is such a collosal train wreck.","true":true}
