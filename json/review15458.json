Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i loved it\\, i really don't understand all the complaints\\, as a long time star wars fan it felt right at home with the series\\, some of the early jokes were meh but once the ball got rolling it's wonderful and everything is unexpected. It keeps you guessing","true":true}
