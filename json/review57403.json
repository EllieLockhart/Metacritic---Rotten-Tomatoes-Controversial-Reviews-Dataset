Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"tHIS MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. tHE PLOT GOES NOWHERE AND THERE IS NO SERIOUS DANGER THAT THE CHARACTERS SEEM IN.  THE WRITING IS TERRIBLE AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT WAS WRITTEN BY SOMEONE TRYING TO EMULATE THE COMEDY IN MARVEL MOVIES.  UNFORTUNATELY THAT DOESN'T WORK IN STAR WARS MOVIES UNLESS IT'S NICELY TIED IN WITH THE PLOT.  THIS MOVIE SEEMS LIKE LUCASFILM OR disney were purposely trying to inject politics into a movie. i don't think this movie will stand the test of time\\, and is very FORGETTABLE.","true":true}
