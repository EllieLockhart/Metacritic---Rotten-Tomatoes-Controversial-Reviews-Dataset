Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Exciting and to some extent unpredictable\\, yes there are holes in the plot on occasions but that is probably due to the fast pace. Star Wars is not real ! Get over it but it is entertaining","true":true}
