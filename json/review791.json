Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An epic continuation of the rebooted saga. Showcases many new original uses of the Force. Strong performances from Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher . The humour is perhaps slightly cheesy\\, lacking the dry wit of the originals but this doesn't take anyway from an overall breathtaking film.","true":true}
