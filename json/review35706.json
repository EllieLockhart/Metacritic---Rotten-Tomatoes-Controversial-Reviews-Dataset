Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a truly amazing\\, beautiful\\, emotional\\, and kineticaly fun ride down memory lane and into the vast unknown. Its an awesome film and greater Star Wars film. I've been lucky enough to see every single Star Wars movie on their opening night since 1980's Empire Strikes Back\\, only missing the origional Star Wars because I was a baby. I was always amazed by these movies\\, some much much more than others\\, but still always found some measure of hope\\, love\\, and adventure in each. But The Last Jedi has been the only Star Wars film so far to make me shed tears both of sadness and joy. I totally have no worry about IX or any other future film because they can go anywhere now and the Force will be with them. To all the whining haters on here trying to bring down a pointless percentage with the hope that it hurts other people so that you may feel a fleeting moment of joy\\, I'm sorry the spoiler theories you had so much faith in were wrong. Also\\, as someone more wise than myself said recently\\, \\\" Everything you have just said...is completely wrong.\\\" :) May the Force be with you.","true":true}
