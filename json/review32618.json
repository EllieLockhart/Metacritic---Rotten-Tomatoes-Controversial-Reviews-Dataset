Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi is not only full of plot holes but it creates plot holes for previous Star Wars films. TLJ is full of cheap laughs that destroy every scene intended to have tension. TLJ not only doesn't answer or continue any theme or plot of Ep7 it succeeds in mocking the viewer for even considering this \\\"trilogy\\\" would have a plot line that flows together. I am a huge Star Wars fan and this did not feel like a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
