Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"New people to the Star Wars seems to enjoy it quite a lot\\, whilst most fans did not get on board.\\nIn my opinion the movie was misguided at best. Mostly felt like a parody of sorts\\, it was borderline mindboggling.\\nJust simply watch the movie. If you haven't seen it\\, means you ain't that much of a nerd and you'll most likely enjoy it.","true":true}
