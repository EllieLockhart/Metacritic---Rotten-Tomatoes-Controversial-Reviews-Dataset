Terrible story with new terrible characters the gameplay wasn't soo cool Ellie was terrible character\\, her relatiship eith Fina was terrible.For her the family is just a joke.I had to play as Abby and understand her story which I don't give a **** about. And Even watch her gnarly parody of sex with Owe. And you wanted me to say Ellie kills 100 persons and 5 dogs to get to Abby and then when she found Abby she realises that revenge is BAD.
