Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"wouldve been way better with Marvel-esque one liners littered through the entire movie. Also was corny starting the movie off with a cheesy also  Marvel-esque comedic dialogue to try and get laughs right out the gates","true":true}
