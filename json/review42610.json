Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was bad. Example how not to make movies.\\nI am totally disappointed. I am fine with plot idea\\, but executoon was a total miss! This movie tries to be \\\"for all audiences\\\" and fails big time.\\nRogue One was a very good movie. Episode VII was Ok\\, but this... garbage.\\nStill happy that frenchise is used as I loce Star Wars\\, but this movie was just bad. Either too short or too long - editing failed.\\nToo much forced humor as well.","true":true}
