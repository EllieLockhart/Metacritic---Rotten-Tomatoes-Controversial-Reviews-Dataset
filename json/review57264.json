Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has been the battleground for all Star Wars fans alike. Some people hate it\\, while others love it. In terms of reasoning\\, this movie offers up points for both sides to make clear and coherent arguments\\, however in my opinion\\, neither are right. After leaving this movie for the first time I couldn't help but feel empty inside; I decided to watch it again only to come out feeling the exact same. It leads me to believe that this movie was exactly that; empty. Characters do things that they wouldn't normally do\\, plot-points introduced in the film before this are thrown in the garbage and the entire plot has as much flow as a traffic jam. It's boring and long\\, not introducing anything to keep the viewers attention in the very least. The only storyline that I believe was done the best was Rey's. Even though I though Luke's character was torched and replaced by an entirely different character\\, Rey seemed to have the most interesting plot development. Every other side story however was boring\\, drawn out and leaves you questioning why the writer chose to do certain things over more interesting alternatives. I can't say I hate this movie\\, but I didn't enjoy it either. I give it a MEH. ","true":true}
