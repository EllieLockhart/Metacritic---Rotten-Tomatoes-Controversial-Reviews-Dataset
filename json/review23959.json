Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Man. The story continues. Unfortunately\\, it felt just like an attempt to make your usual Disney animated movie into a live action Star Wars film- and it fell flat... over and over. I'm sad to say that it's as bad as THE FORCE AWAKENS. If you love the original trilogy\\,  stick to that. Yoda would approve :(","true":true}
