Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw this last night\\, and truly enjoyed it. I'm completely shocked at all of the 1\/2 and 1-star reviews that say this is the worst star wars movie ever. \\n\\nIt's not. \\n\\nThe acting\\, dialogue and story telling were fantastic. I'm relegated to believe that all the negative reviews generate from either trolls with straw accounts or poor souls that have invested more into a fictional story than into their real lives. What ever the case\\, I encourage you to see the last Jedi.","true":true}
