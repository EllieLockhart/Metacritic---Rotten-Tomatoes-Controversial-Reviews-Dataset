Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the kick in the hyperdrive motivator the franchise needed. Congratulations to Rian Johnson for having the fortitude to take Star Wars in new directions\\, instead of rehashing the same old stories about the same old characters.\\nThe anger and backlash at this film is misplaced and silly.\\nLuke was always whiny. Becoming a Jedi master did not change his nature. We know as much about Snoke as we knew about the Emperor through the first trilogy.\\nAnd the best thing about Last Jedi is that it dares to deliver something no other Star Wars film could handle: Moral ambiguity. Gone are the simplistic days of easy to spot good guys vs. bad guys. Johnson has introduced shades of gray and\\, in doing so\\, made the future of Star Wars more interesting.","true":true}
