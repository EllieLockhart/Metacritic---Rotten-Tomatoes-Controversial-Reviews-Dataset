Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was 36 days old when Star Wars began in 1977 and it\u2019s been a huge part of my life ever since. I absolutely loved The Last Jedi. So much heart\\, so much humor\\, incredible action sequences\\, and many wonderful surprises. I was on the edge of my seat during the entire movie with a big grin on my face and the occasional tear in my eye. It had so many twists and didn\u2019t stick to any preconceived formula. I really don\u2019t understand the backlash that this amazing movie is getting from \u2018fans\u2019. The truth is that nothing will ever match the magic that the originals had for those of us that grew up on it. But I for one am so happy for this next generation of movie goers that get to experience this new trilogy and all upcoming Star Wars movies. I\u2019m about to go see it again and I can\u2019t wait.
