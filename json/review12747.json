Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I created an account to say don\u2019t believe all of the negative reviews others are writing. It\u2019s clear their is a group trying to drive the score low. This was an entertaining movie and a great new chapter to the Star Wars films\\, I enjoyed as much as Force Awakens and the original three - and Return of the Jedi was the first movie I remember seeing in a theater (to show my age).","true":true}
