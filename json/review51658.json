Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A deconstruction of Star Wars mythos that came too early in the saga's continuation and was clearly the result of reactionary writing rather than a clear plan. Brave\\, but traitorous.","true":true}
