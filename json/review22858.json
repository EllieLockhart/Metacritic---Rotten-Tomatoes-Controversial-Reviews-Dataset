Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Long time OT fan\\, wasn't the biggest fan of TFA (grew to love it over a number of rewatches)\\, and wow\\, TLJ! Other than the callbacks to the previous films\\, it is a fresh look for Star Wars\\, with realistic plot twists (without giving any spoilers away: unlikely plans that DO NOT go according to plan\\, and sometimes utterly fail)\\, with set-ups of the likes of the OT\\, only to have the output be completely different to what may be expected in the Star Wars universe. What a great ride! As a middle-of-trilogy film\\, I suspect this film will get as much slack as Empire Strikes Back did on release (a film that only gained legendary status after the release of RotJ and circumspection)\\, so I presume this will perhaps be the case for TLJ as well. Great movie\\, great twists: leave all expectations\\, fan theories\\, the EU etc at the door\\, this film aims to show a changed Star Wars universe\\, one that has changed in 30 years\\, sometimes for the better\\, sometimes for the worse\\, and that is fine. This type of progression is the same as what happens in reality\\, and Star Wars the Last Jedi captures this perfectly. Kudos\\, excited to see what is to come in Ep IX.","true":true}
