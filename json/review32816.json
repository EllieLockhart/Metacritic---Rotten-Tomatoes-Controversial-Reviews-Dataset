Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars the last jedi was the greatest bomb that ever slowly blown up in my face.Rei accomplished nothing and didn't grow at all during the entire movie.Finn and his accomplice were useless\\, they failed to do anything critical.Kylo was the one saving grace of the movie even though he got shafted during the fight with the imperial guard.Imperial guard are the best of the best\\, they are chose among the best storm troopers and then tortured to be the best.Finally they have to kill everyone else in their class to prove their loyalty and show they are the best.Rei dispatched them rather easily while Kylo struggled\\, even though he had more training then Rei.Sadly Luke was made weak so Rei can appear stronger and the sad thing Luke should have not even tried to beat Rei.Rei lifted the boulders with practically no training while Luke had to train in order just to pick up a few rocks\\, under the training of Yoda.","true":true}
