Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last jedi fails to coherently continue the story established by the force awakens while also ignoring the history of previously existing characters by changing their personalities and motives for the sake of subverting audience expectations. \\n\\nthe last jedi feels out of place in the star wars franchise because it is not true to the films that came before it.","true":true}
