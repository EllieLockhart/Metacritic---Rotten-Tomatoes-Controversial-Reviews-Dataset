Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very sloppy\\, no character development\\, and boring. Lots of plot holes too\\, I think their editors were asleep when they reviewed the film for problems. There was something artistically appealing about some of the scenes\\, but that was not integrated into the story.","true":true}
