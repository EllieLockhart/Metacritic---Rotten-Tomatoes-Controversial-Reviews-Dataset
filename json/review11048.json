{"101487":127481,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"here are so many moments where they bait and switch the audience: come for answers and get next to nothing.\\n\\nSnoke --> big powerful sith? Nope easily punked. Who was he? Supposedly rebuilt the entire might of the empire but we are not going to talk about that.. but we will give you a laugh with him being cut in half\\, tongue out.\\n\\nFinn: project resurrection (the stealing of children to rebuild the empire) where did Finn com from? No answer instead we will give you a worthless casino bit and him awkwardly beating Phasma (she was just as short lived as in the force awakens-- why have the character as visually appealing as Phasma to do nothing with them?).\\n\\nLuke: a person who never gave up on his family.... Just kidding he had one moment of doubt and ran away for 15 years. A guy who literally was willing to die for his dad\\, a man he barely knew\\, but he won't exhaust the same energy on a nephew he has been a mentor and teacher too? Mark Hamill was awesome\\, but the story and old mean man act was so different from the end of return of the Jedi that they needed way more back story to make it feel true for us that have loved that character. The more I think about Luke the more upsetting it is\\, this fundamentally changed the character because they wanted it for the movie\\, with no prep to make it believable. Also let us not forget that the entire plot of The Force Awakens was finding a map that Luke left to let others find him\\, but now he doesn't want to be found?\\n\\nRey: I love this character but they made her into a \\\"Mary Sue\\\". In Force Awakens they raised questions that pointed to a rich backstory (why did she know wookie\\, why did she know how to use a lightsaber\\, why was the millennium falcon there\\, why did her mom say in the book version \\\"I'll be back for you sweetheart\\\"\\, why is she connected to Kylo\\, why does she know nothing of the rebellion\\, etc...)  and in this movie the answer is the force. A Mary Sue is a character that a shows up with unexplained power and is better and more important than the originals just because. I defended this character to the fanboys that said she was a Mary Sue in the last movie. I was wrong. \\n\\nRey and Leia just somehow magically know how to use the force better than the trained Jedi. The blatant inventing of Force powers just for the convenience of this story just pisses me off. The Jedi have existed for 20\\,000 years (1000 generations) but just now Luke figures out how to astral project (and even 3PO can see him?!)\\, Yoda is a corporeal ghost because we thought it was funny (oh\\, and he can summon a lightning storm\\, which no Jedi has ever done before\\, but hey\\, it was funny to see him light up that tree)\\, Rey and Kylo can Force Skype (which is the best part of the movie\\, but still is lore breaking) and Leia can fly through space without dying. And we are being told we are being crybabies when we say \\\"That's not how the Force works!\\\"\\n\\nI would add that the movie made the First Order laughable.  Hux and Kylo are the butt of too many jokes to be believable.  The bad guys of the original series (Tarkin\\, Vader\\, Palatine\\, even Boba Fett) had presence and were menacing because they believed in what they were doing. The First Order is literally a joke. Even in the prequels we were at least made to feel like there was a purpose and a history to everything that was happening.  And think about it.  The whole plot of TLJ basically got us nowhere.  The resistance is just more outmanned and outgunned than before.  And somehow the jokes in the First Order kept them pinned down better than the Empire ever did with the Rebellion.\\n\\nAnd none of this touches on the story flaws.  Too many of the story lines were pointless\\, hand waved too many times\\, and they all just deus ex-ed their way out of problems. Even the chase doesn't make any sense.  Why doesn't some of the First Order just jump to lightspeed and box the resistance in?  Awfully damn convenient that they forget they can do that. They also CAN scan for small ships.  That was in some of the first scenes of the first movie!  The star destroyer totally picked up the launch of the life pod that had C3P0 and R2 in it\\, and could even tell it didn't have lifeforms. They forgot how to do that? Or all of a sudden all resistance ships have cloaking tech because they tell us they do (\\\"No ship that small has a cloaking device\\\") and we are supposed to believe it because ...why?\\n\\nAnother plot problem: because the story went no where most of our characters had nothing to do and the subplots they come up with\\, while already implausible (They can make it to that casino planet and back in 18 hours or less?  Really?!?)\\, and then we are supposed to believe that Johnson is some genius because he \\\"subverts\\\" these subplots by having them end in failure. It is sloppy storytelling. Nothing is gained from this misadventure\\, except a forced romance that most of the audience was surprised to realize was there when Rose kisses Finn.\\n\\nI could go on but yes I have problems with the movie. I loved so many of the fight elements and it was visually beautiful but the story was such a slap in the face of the audience - don't ask questions\\, dummies\\, just buy porgs!\\n\\n\\nPS. Fanboys\\, you care about story? Don't cry.  Disney will have some writer fill in Finn's and Snoke's and everyone's backstory in a book that can be yours for $15-$20 bucks each\\, and we will tie the hands of the the authors of those books so much that they will be pretty damn boring and pointless too. Enjoy!!!","true":true}
