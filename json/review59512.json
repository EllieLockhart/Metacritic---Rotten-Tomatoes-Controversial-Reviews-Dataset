I\u2019ve owned every Playstation console and have never really enjoyed the Microsoft offerings as much\\, but am considering switching platforms for the next generation. Can a game be that bad that it destroys a studio and looses an entire console generation? Only time will tell.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
