Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible storytelling\\, huge plot holes\\, ruined characters\\, disrespectful of decades of lore\\, just...disappointing for a long time Star Wars fan.  I cannot understand virtually any of the decisions they made for this movie.","true":true}
