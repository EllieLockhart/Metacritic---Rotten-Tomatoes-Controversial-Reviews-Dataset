Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie spends so much time attempting to portray what it falsely sees as a sophisticated view of morality that it forgets that heroes are meant to be heroic.\\nAlthough it attempts to give us some justification for why Kylo Ren is the way that he is\\, it mostly fails to make us believe that the villains of the movie have any sincere mission.\\n\\nNothing interesting\\, exciting\\, groundbreaking\\, just a massive dud. This director will single handedly ruin was was once great if they let him continue. JJ Abrams at least kept the heart going\\, Rian Johnson is basically a loser.","true":true}
