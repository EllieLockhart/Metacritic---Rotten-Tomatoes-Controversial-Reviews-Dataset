Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You know the tomato meter is paid bullshit when the audience score is near below 50%.\\n\\nVery little about Last Jedi makes any sense. Poor directing\\, poor story telling\\, poor character development\\, poor musical score\\, am I missing anything? Without any spoilers\\, if this is the direction of Star Wars\\, then Star Wars is dead. Seems like something the Chinese market would enjoy because they don't know the back story and enjoy anything that's Western.\\n\\nThen again\\, in today's world\\, everything is about money and numbers\\, when anything is hell bent on maximizing profit\\, quality suffers.","true":true}
