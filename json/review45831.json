Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very sad because this movie is very bad. I feel hungry and sad. Was this ghost directed by Lena Dunham? I like Snoke bc he looks like a big worm\\, why he die tho? The little birds r cute tho. Might as well have starred ROSS from Friends amirite y'all lol lol","true":true}
