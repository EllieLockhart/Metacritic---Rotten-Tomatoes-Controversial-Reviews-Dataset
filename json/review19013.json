Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's easier to talk about what was good with this movie\\, because so much was awful.\\n\\nThe good stuff: Possibly the best scene in a Star Wars movie to date is in TLJ; when Hodo suicided the Star Destroyer in a hyperspace jump. Likewise\\, this may have had the best Star Wars fight scene to date; Kylo and Rey in the throne room.\\n\\nOther than that\\, this whole movie could have been 1 hour 30 mins long with the cruft cut out.\\n\\nThis might go down as the worst Star Wars movie ever made. I'm having a hard time picking between this and the prequels for last place.","true":true}
