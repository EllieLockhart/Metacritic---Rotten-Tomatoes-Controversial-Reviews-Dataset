The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Here's my take. For reference\\, the first game is easily my favorite game of all time and my favorite story ever told. I do not understand all the negativity that surrounds this game. I hear people complain about how the characters that we grew to love are treated\\, and you know what? First off it's a post apocalyptic world\\, people die\\, get over it. Also\\, at first I was a little mad about Joel's death\\, but as the game unfolded it made sense. Everyone **** about Abby\\, and at first I didn't like the idea of playing as her\\, but she also has a side to the story\\, and she is not the monster that everyone puts her out to be. Her side shows she has heart and care for others. Those others just happen not to be the characters we love from the first game. What this game really shows is that Ellie is no more evil than Abby is\\, and Joel was no more evil than Abby is too. I think Tess said it best in the first game. \\\"We're **** people Joel\\, it's been that way for a long time.\\\"NOBODY in this world is a saint. Ellie and Joel are just as bad people as all of the WLF and Abby. This shows you that the world is dark\\, and it's meant to be. Once I warmed up to Abby as a character\\, I really did not mind her place in the story\\, and I think her motivation for killing Joel is well warranted. Did I want it to happen as a fan of the series? No. But I feel it was necessary to make a sequel worth anything. If you're a hater\\, take a second look. Put yourself into the shoes of every character\\,  especially the ones you take control of. It's not a bad game. Matter of fact\\, it's fantastic. Cheesy moments from time to time\\, but not enough for me to go review bomb this game like everyone else is doing. Enjoy it\\, and realize at the end of the day\\, it's just a video game. Don't take it too seriously\\, and don't let it upset you like it has so many people.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
