Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Long time star wars fan here. If you'd like to watch a movie with an extremely boring plot\\, continued attempts at pathetic humor\\, and dialog that could be assembled by an elementary school child\\, then this is the movie for you. Not only was the movie itself horrid\\, what it did to the Star Wars saga was absolutely absurd. I have a hard time thinking that the director\/writer\\, Rian Johnson\\, could have possibly been a star wars fan prior to creating this monstrosity. I am indeed what you can consider a Star Wars \\\"fanboy\\\" and the reasons this movie in particular upset me is NOT because of its differences. Neither \\\"Rogue One\\\" nor \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" received this type of overwhelming criticism from such a large group of long time fans so to people trying to defend this \\\"fanboy\\\" mentality of \\\"anti-change\\,\\\" find a new excuse. Please help us JJ Abrams\\, you're my only hope.","true":true}
