Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw this movie twice-- once on opening night and again a few nights after with some friends.  It's not bad for a Star Wars movie (a movie with a ton of expectation.) . But some of the dialogue is truly cringe-worthy and some of the story writing is baffling.  The entire middle of the movie was expendable and kind of boring.  That being said\\, its a Star Wars movie.  So it is still a must-see.","true":true}
