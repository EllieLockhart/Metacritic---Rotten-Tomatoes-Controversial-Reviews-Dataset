We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"If you haven\u2019t played the game and worry about spoilers\\, don\u2019t read the review bellow.\r\rOh my god. I can't stand all the garbage people are saying about the game. Everyone is pissed off because character development was not the way they wanted to be\\, or characters actions was not what they judge best\\, or because it looks too much political now\\, or because two girls are getting laid\\, or\u2026 come on people! Grow the ***** up! Stop complaining and just send you god damn curriculum to Naughty Dog and do something better than this. I\u2019m kidding. Naughty Dog wouldn\u2019t employee people like this.\r\rIn my humble opinion\\, this is a masterpiece and the best 2020 game so far.\r\rHomossexual relationship\\, transgender and other stuff are topic in the game\\, but in a secondary way. And by the way\\, I don't see this as a problem. I could care less about what Ellie are into. If she is into girls\\, well good for her. If Abby is stronger the Rambo\\, well good for her too. I can't believe that this became something to judge in a game.\r\rThe game give to us\\, again\\, a harsh reality. And that won't be necessarily a reality we wanted to. Well DEAL WITH IT! Sometimes people we care just die. Out of nothing! And here comes the shocking spoiler: This happens in real life too! If you can\u2019t stand Joel\u2019s death\\, imagine what Ellie felt. If you are too weak and can\u2019t stand the feeling\\, stop playing and go find something more colorful to cheer you up. You probably won\u2019t find any consolation in this game. Well I did. But it looks like people don\u2019t think the way I do. It would be too easy for the world.\r\rI think Ellie is so confused about her feelings that some people say the whole revenge thing is not so convincing. That she turns into a crazy maniac killing people on her way and didn\u2019t even finish what she started. Well that was the way she dealt with loss. In the end\\, she probably didn't even want that revenge. Maybe she was just so messed up\\, that killing people was the excuse for her to at least feel something different from regret. And not killing Abby in the end?! For me that was the masterpiece decision. She saw Abby as Joel and Lev as herself when she was young. For me that was the masterpiece. Forgiveness is a way better message for me than revenge. That made me admire her more than I already did.\r\rBest character ever. Best development ever. And yes\\, for me is much better than the first one.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
