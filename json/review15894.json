Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I LOVE THIS FILM!! CANT EXPLAIN HOW GOOD IT IS! I honestly can't believe it only has a 56%. It's sad because when Disney goes in a different direction that everyone didn't expect. So many people don't like it. Like\\, The Force Awakens\\, got critizised for being \\\"safe\\\" and a copy of ANH. But with this\\, it's not The Empire Strikes Back. But still people hate this movie\\, Disney just can't win. 5\/5 amazing.","true":true}
