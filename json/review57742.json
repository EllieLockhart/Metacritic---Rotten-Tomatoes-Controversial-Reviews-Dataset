Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointed with the film. Amazing cinematography and sound but the good work setting up new story lines in The Force Awakens were totally undone here. \\n\\nPlot lines were set up that seemed weak and the whole casino scene is unnecessary. \\n\\nVery disappointed.","true":true}
