Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Story lines and character arcs from previous installments were tossed aside.  Events were tied together by contrivances that made no sense.  Visually it was very very nice but watching this movie is like being a 10 year old boy again and being given a beautifully wrapped Christmas present that when opened contains a pair of pink socks.\\n\\n-A casual viewer","true":true}
