Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I finally got around to watching this. What a confusing mess. The reason for the main plot made no sense. Space ships running out of fuel? How does that even work? Characters seemingly had no common sense or motivation for their actions. And Luke dies in the end\\, seemingly out of spite.","true":true}
