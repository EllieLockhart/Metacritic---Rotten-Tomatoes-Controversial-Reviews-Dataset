You will not be left with a shortage of things to do in Yakuza.\r\rThe fighting system is still the best this side of actual fighting games\\, while games like Arkham and Sleeping Dogs offer a bit more crisp of combat\\, Yakuza surpasses them in sheer variety. Combos with each style\\, plus heat moves\\, plus weapons\\, so much fun.\r\rAnother great addition to the franchise\\, next up\\, Kiwami.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
