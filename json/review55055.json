Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never hated a movie enough to waste time rating it. This movie is that bad. I would explain but there are many who have already articulated it far better than I could in a short paragraph. If possible I would give it negative stars\\, and a bullet in the back of the head to put it out of its misery.","true":true}
