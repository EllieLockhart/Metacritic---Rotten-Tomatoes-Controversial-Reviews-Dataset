Unfortunately this is not the case with TLoU2 where you feel the 50% of the game is cinematics\\, 30% of the game is walking and exploring and 20% is actual gameplay. and then\\, we have the political agenda\\, the fact that they would remove Joel from the game and replace him with a gorilla girl on steroids in order to pander to feminists and those other weirdos talks a lot about the director and the quality of his ideas. Neil Druckmann is a clown and should never be in charge of directing a game. to say this game is a disappointment is putting it very mildly.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
