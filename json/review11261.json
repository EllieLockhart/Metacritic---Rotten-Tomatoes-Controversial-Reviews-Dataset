Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly\\, the beginning was really slow and I felt like there were a lot of unnecessary scenes\\, scenes that were dragged on way too long\\, unnecessary references to past movies\\, out of place jokes\\, and scenes that required more explanations to make sense. It also just feels like the movie had a lot of recycled ideas from past Star Wars movies. I was really excited to see the movie but it ended up not reaching my expectations.","true":true}
