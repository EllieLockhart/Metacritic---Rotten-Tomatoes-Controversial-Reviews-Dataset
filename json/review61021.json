It honestly makes no sense to allow Ellie and Tommy to live when they know exactly who killed Joel. Literally everything after this point should be considered fantasy because if I was Abby I would have killed both Tommy and Ellie after killing Joel and thus left no witnesses to what occurred.\r\rThis is some of the most god awful fanfic garbage. I didn\u2019t particularly care for the ending of the first game but it was clear they wanted to do some sort of generational thing with Ellie becoming the new playable character in the second game especially when you take into account the DLC of the first game pushing that agenda.\r\rThe start of 2 was solid up until Joel\u2019s death. The game was over at that point. They honestly should have made this a game fleshing out Ellie\u2019s growing up and attempting to come to terms with what Joel did in the first game\\, the ending would be when Abby kills not just Joel but also Ellie and Tommy. You shouldn\u2019t even know who killed him to be honest.\r\rThen as a dlc or as a pre-sequel game they could then explore Abbey\u2019s story starting immediately following the end of part 1 and leading up to killing Joel. The player wouldn\u2019t know what is going on until the moment of truth when she kills Joel\\, Tommy and Ellie.\r\rThere were any number of ways to handle this and ND chose one of the worst ones. \u201cCritics\u201d are saying users are review bombing the game but lets be real here\\, we didn\u2019t get the game for free\\, we don\u2019t receive review copies of games and WE SURE AS **** DONT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BEING BLACK BALLED BY TRASH COMPANIES MAD ABOUT A REVIEW WORSE THAN A 7.5.\r\rANY CRITIC THAT GAVE THIS GAME HIGHER THAN A 6 IS EITHER A SELLOUT OR SMOKING CRACK!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
