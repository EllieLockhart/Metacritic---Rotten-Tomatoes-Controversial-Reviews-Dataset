Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As many have already said\\, the important bits of the plot didn't quite make sense. The writers really let the series and the fans down with this one\\, which is unfortunate because Episode 7 really got it off to a great start. For us Star Wars fans\\, we can only hope that the failures of Episode 8 didn't completely ruin the current series. Here's to looking ahead to Episode 9. Cheers.","true":true}
