Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was kind of a mixture between a remake\\, and a crappy story without logic. I did not like it\\, because Disney wanted it to be 100% safe to sell\\, and did not dare to operate with new elements. With this part of the story I feel like the star wars universe is heading nowhere\\, and\\, again\\, this episode does not add to much new planets\\, species or anything to the sw universe (just like episode 7)","true":true}
