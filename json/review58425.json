Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A grand experience. \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" broke new ground and soared to new heights in the Star Wars saga. This wasn't your average sci-fi flick and for that I applaud it. Director Rian Johnson (Looper and Breaking Bad) also threw in his own creative spark. Plus\\, superb performances from both Mark Hamill and the late Carrie Fisher. \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" advanced the universe and blurred the lines between good and evil. This is a movie that will emotionally shake you to your fanhood core. For that\\, job well done.","true":true}
