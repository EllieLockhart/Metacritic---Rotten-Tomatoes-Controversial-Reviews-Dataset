Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The good: The visuals. It is a visually beautiful film. The acting\\, for the most part\\, is also good.\\nThe Bad: The character development\\, or the lack of development. Rose Tico? Could have been a cool character\\, instead she is preachy and annoying. Finn? I liked him in TFA\\, but here is he a worthless clown used for garbage jokes. Then when he shows some growth and sacrifices himself for the cause what does Johnson do? Ruin it. Good job. Rey... Nothing to see  here. No growth\\,  no development\\, nothing. I hat to say it\\, but yeah she's a Mary Sue as the writer\/director was too lazy to do anything with her (and the other characters as well). \\nThe ugly: Mary Leia Poppins... Totally awful. And Holdo. Again\\, awful. And what's up with the costume they put her in? She looks like she's ready for a Night at the Roxbury or perhaps a night gambling on Canto Bight. \\nOverall: I'd rethink giving Rian Johnson a trilogy. Certainly not one that he himself wrote.","true":true}
