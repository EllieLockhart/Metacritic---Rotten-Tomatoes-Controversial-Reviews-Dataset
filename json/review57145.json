Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not my Star Wars. These are not my heroes. I cannot believe how such iconic characters as Luke Skywalker\\, Princess Leia and Han Solo have been treated by the sequel trilogy. It's heartbreaking and so\\, so disappointing. It is revealed in TLJ that Luke is essentially to blame for the fall of his nephew to the Dark Side\\, leading to the deaths of millions\\, including his own dear friend and brother-in-law\\, Han Solo. And then\\, to top it off\\, his failure as a Jedi also makes him ultimately responsible for the destruction of the New Republic and the ascension of the First Order to power? REALLY\\, DISNEY!? Don't even get me started on the disgusting suggestion that there's some romantic or sexual tension between the characters of Krylo Whiney-Arse and Rey. How utterly irresponsible of Disney (Disney!!) to depict a young girl falling for and\/or trying to \\\"save\\\" her abuser. I can't believe this is what we get after waiting all these years to see how the OT heroes wound up. A disgrace.","true":true}
