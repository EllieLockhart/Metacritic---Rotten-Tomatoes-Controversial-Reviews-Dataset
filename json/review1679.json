Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As an avid fan of star wars 1-7\\, this is by far the worst.  They introduced new characters to achieve a racial diversity quota that don't further the story\\, but instead hampers it.  rey\\, Poe and finn are void of character development.  And Luke Skywalker was reduced to a grumpy coward for no good reason.  I repeat\\, No good reason. ANd this is only scratching the surface of the problems This is the first star wars movie I have seen in theatres without repeat viewings.  Very disappointed.  This trilogy should have been entirely JJ Abrams.","true":true}
