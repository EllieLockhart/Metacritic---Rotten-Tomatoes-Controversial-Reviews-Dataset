Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"91%?? ROFLL\\, sure its visually appealing but the rest of it is gutter trash. Its like they didn't know what to do so HEYY lets just add pointless sjw soulless illogical garbage every time they didn't know how to progress the story instead of with you know ACTUAL STORY TELLING and CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. \\n\\n\\nThis movie was horrible and what they did with Luke\\, what the actual wow..... what a joke.\\n\\nhalf a star really is being generous.","true":true}
