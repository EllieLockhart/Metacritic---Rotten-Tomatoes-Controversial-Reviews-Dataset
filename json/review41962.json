Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie killed star wars for me. The goal here was not to tell a star wars story\\, but to push a leftist agenda down everyone's throat. Bad story telling\\, Bad character development and motivations. Visually beautiful\\, stunning. The art team done an incredible job\\, but all that is rendered meaningless when there is no meaning. I can't sit through the third one.","true":true}
