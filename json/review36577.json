Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie has beautiful photography from the beginning to the end\\, but to me the main plot (running out of fuel) was very Saturday morning cartoon\\, very TV episode\\, not for a big screen blockbuster as Star Wars. I wanted to finally see Luke and Leia (since Han was killed) go in a big and fun adventure together like the OT\\, but it never happened and it never will\\, waste of great characters! The movie that splitted the fans in two.","true":true}
