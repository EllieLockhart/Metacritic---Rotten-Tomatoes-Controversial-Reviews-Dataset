Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars is dead. Not just now\\, after TLJ's release\\, but since the release of TFA. If the only means of driving the story forward is to denigrate and humiliate the trials\\, tribulations\\, and triumphs of the original trio then your story is trash and not worth telling. The characters are not worthy of their predecessors. Disney\\, Lucasfilm\\, Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson have done irreparable damage to the saga. It's because of this that the above four will never receive any of my money ever again. You humiliated my childhood hero\\, Luke Skywalker\\, and I will never forgive you for it. The Star Wars saga ended at the completion of Return of the Jedi. Our three heroes lived happily ever after and the shadow of the Disney juggernaut is but a bad dream.","true":true}
