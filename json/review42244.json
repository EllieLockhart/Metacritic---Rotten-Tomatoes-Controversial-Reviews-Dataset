Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie sucked big steaming donkey balls. That is how bad it was.  Years ago\\, I never believed that Disney could screw up worse than Lucas did with his Jar Jar prequals...then \\\"The Farce Awakens\\\" came...and I was in shock.  I was sure that Disney would redeem themselves this time\\, but instead they doubled down on stupid and magnified on the lame.. \\\"The Lost Jedi\\\" is worse than The Farce Awakens! It's like a curse\\, each movie just gets worse!","true":true}
