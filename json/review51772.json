Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A divisive film for me. At parts I feel it laughs at the unoriginality of Episode VII and attempts to distance itself from it with curve balls such as Snoke\u2019s fate. Other times it seems to be intent on copying Episode V\\, like how VII copied IV\\, such as again having similar locations and themes to V. The film has some intense action scenes and great humour which gives it great moments\\, but this is offset by by a slow space chase\\, weird force-sensitive Leia and a pointless coup d\u2019etait\\, that really goes nowhere. The film is an infusion of brilliance and sheer incredulity\\, but it is undoubtedly the best in the awful Sequel Trilogy.","true":true}
