Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Other than some bogus science to add dramatic effect\\, very unpredictable and entertaining movie. Good acting as well. Characters seem to get lucky a little too often\\, vesus solving problems with skill and intelligence.","true":true}
