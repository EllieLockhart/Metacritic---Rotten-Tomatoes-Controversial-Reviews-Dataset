{"101487":101372,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-05-22","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A long time ago in a galaxy far\\, far away ...\\n\\nIn the forty years since those words first broke the darkness of the cinema and leapt into our imaginations they have taken on a greater meaning than ever was imagined or even intended.  They now represent not just the experience of being transported into that fantastic universe that George Lucas created out of plastic\\, hobby glue and rebellious determination but also the decades of emotional investment of millions of fans all over the world.  They bear now the weight of a fantastic and terrible glory layered year after year with passion and growing nostalgia like some gargantuan pop culture pearl grown in the psyche of three generations of fandom.\\n\\nAdding to that legacy is a rare opportunity\\, and one that rightly instills a degree of trepidation into the hearts of those who get tapped to steward any new chapter of the franchise.  Since our vocal excoriation of the prequel trilogy (which we all went to see multiple times by the way\\, Jar Jar or no Jar Jar) we Star Wars fans have rightfully earned a reputation as a fickle and critical bunch.  Besides\\, who wants to tinker with people's childhood memories?  It's a minefield where one misstep could get you years of fan derision - just ask the franchise's creator George Lucas.\\n\\nBehind the scenes interviews from Episode VII showed that J.J Abrams understood the weight of what he was doing.  Indeed he initially rejected the offer to helm Disney's first turn at bat after acquiring the billion dollar property\\, telling news outlets that he would rather be in the audience.  Eventually however after coaxing from both Lawrence Kasdan and Steven Spielberg\\, J.J. gave in and his opening allegro in the latest chapter of the Skywalker family saga met with acclaim and adulation from the fanbase in large part because of the copious fan service and obvious affection woven into the work.  In fact the only real criticism of Abram's Force Awakens was that it cleaved so closely to the formula in the original Star Wars that rather than telling a new story it simply rehashed a lot of what we had already seen - and while this may have awakened in all of us the nostalgia and love of forty years of fandom it didn't constitute a new creative expression that might keep the franchise alive for another generation.\\n\\nAfter watching Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi one wishes the director of this latest chapter had approached the work with the same reverence as his predecessor - or even that he had turned down the offer altogether and spared us and the franchise his insufferable need to 'say something important' about the Star Wars series.\\n\\nTo be fair Johnson has taken real risks and has created a visually fantastic experience filled with dramatic and unexpected moments\\, some surprisingly good performances and all of the exotic creatures\\, explosive action and humor one expects to experience in a galaxy far\\, far away.  Unfortunately all of the beauty of what Johnson has brought to the screen is lost amidst his heavy handed attempt to untether the franchise from the weight of its past and compose a commentary about its future.  If Abrams was enslaved by the legacy of the Force\\, Johnson has turned to the other extreme in his rejection of fans' expectations and his overwhelming need to provoke a conversation about this modern mythology.  Rather than coming off as a brilliant expansion of the universe into a bright new era the tone-deafness of the film and its seeming disrespect for the lowest common denominators of the fandom feels like a reactionary screed against both the safe\\, nostalgic indulgence of The Force Awakens and the deep divides of our current cultural moment.\\n\\n\\n\\\"Kid\\, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.  I've seen a lot of strange stuff...\\\"\\n\\nTo understand where The Last Jedi went wrong you have to go back to the beginning.  When George Lucas first put the story of an unknown boy from a backwater planet saving the galaxy onto the big screen it was groundbreaking.  There's no way to fully express to those who didn't live through it exactly how unexpected and different Star Wars was.  Those of us who grew up with Star Wars can't really understand the world before it but Lucas had managed to do through film what authors like Tolkien and Herbert had done in literature - transport us into a fantastic and yet believable world the likes of which no one had ever seen before.  It was a revelation in the most literal sense of the word.\\n\\nIt is equally difficult to distill exactly how that sort of magic happens but we can point to a few common elements that seem to be present in all such epic works that so keenly resonate with us and draw us in.  First of course is the world building aspect\\, where the author drops in-universe references and allusions whose unexplained ubiquity sells us on the belief that there is a much bigger world than the small glimpse we are getting and inspires our imaginations to fill in the blanks.  (What's the Kessel Run?  Why do they mine tibanna gas?  What happened in the Butlerian Jihad?  Wait there's HOW MANY rings of power?  Who is Luthien?)  \\n\\nSecondly these engrossing imaginary worlds are populated by characters we like and relate to:  Luke feels stuck being a nobody\\, Frodo is scared that evil might be winning and that he might be too small to make a difference\\, and young Paul Atreides is stranded in a foreign environment\\, struggling to chart his own course in a life that feels orchestrated by power structures he's only beginning to understand.  We empathize with these protagonists and their journeys and they help us contextualize our own lives.  We can see ourselves living in this universe because they do.\\n\\nThird\\, and perhaps most importantly\\, these new mythologies tell familiar stories - the stories that we've been telling ourselves for all of human history from the campfires of our ancient past\\, to classical epic poems\\, to binge-worthy TV adaptations of modern literature.  The truth is that there aren't any new stories or storytelling devices\\, a quick trip to TVTropes will dispel that illusion for any aspiring author\\, and the single most common (and resonant) mythological tale in human history is the hero's journey.\\n\\nLucas of course was a student of movies\\, culture and mythology.  He had read his Joseph Campbell and knew Sir Arthur's 7 plots and so he built a story arc that was as old as time but which felt fresh and new because of its setting.  The rest as they say is history - and while Rian Johnson may love that history\\, he is also tired of it repeating itself.  Lucas once said that these movies are like stanzas in a poem or a song\\, they're made to rhyme with each other - visually\\, thematically\\, tonally.  The call-backs and the echoes of the past aren't the result of a lack of creativity\\, they're a purposeful inclusion telling a larger story.  Now into this multi-part symphony Rian Johnson's Last Jedi introduces a purposeful dissonance meant not just to challenge the characters in the tale but also to challenge the viewers right from the beginning.\\n\\n\\n\\\"Hokey religions and ancient weapons...\\\"\\n\\nWhen we return to Ach-to\\, right at the moment we left off\\, we find Rey holding the legendary lightsaber whose rediscovery remains shrouded in mystery\\, whose heritage is the very thing that has brought our young heroine to this secluded island on this secluded planet.  It has called to her somehow and now she has not just become entangled in the Skywalker drama but has been elevated to the role of a champion of the light.  This elegant weapon which once belonged to Anakin before he became Darth Vader is a powerful symbol and was so central a part of Episode VII that it very nearly became its own character a la Peter Jackson's treatment of the One Ring.  Rey hands the revered item to Luke and he unceremoniously chuck's it over his shoulder and off of the cliff.  Right from the start Rian Johnson is letting you know what you are in for - your sacred talismans are about to be dismantled; and not with the gentle touch of a fellow traveller who shares the bittersweetness of the passing of an Age with you but rather with the malgn smirk of a trickster who is enjoying your discomfort as he ushers in something new whether you like it or not.\\n\\nThis is only the first of many such symbolic moments in the film where Rian flirts with fulfilling your expectations of more of the same but then pulls the rug from beneath you.  Some of the moments are actually welcome - such as Kylo's choice to murder Snoke but NOT turn back to the light or DJ's nonchalant betrayal of Finn and Rose - no smuggler with a heart of gold\\, he.  Far too often however Johnson appears so obsessed with subverting expectations that he has no regard for either the consequences of those subversions on the larger story nor the tone with which these challenges are delivered.\\n\\nThe camera work and pacing on the Lightsaber toss are perfect examples of this.  It's dealt with not as drama\\, but as comedy.  Johnson is winking at you through the camera with the speed with which Luke chucks this history-laden symbol over his shoulder and with the way the camera takes in its pitiful plop as it lands.  This is no conspiratorial gesture though\\, no sharing of a moment that only we the initiated will understand and enjoy together\\, no this reads as a knowing smirk as if to say - 'just wait\\, I'm only getting started.'\\n\\nSo also with the jokes in the opening sequence directed at General Hux.  This in particular was one of several places where the humor fell flat because it's tone came off as disrespectful to the universe.  I remember vividly sitting in the theater watching The Force Awakens for the first time and when that memorable Hux speech to the First Order came on the screen leaning over to a friend sitting next to me and quipping\\, \\\"This Hux guy takes his membership in Hitler Youth really seriously.\\\"  We chuckled - and we still do.  We all know that Hux is over the top and together we're allowed to poke a little fun at him here on the other side of the glass - but when Rian Johnson has Poe\\, Kylo and Snoke all deride him in the course of the film he's taking that external commentary and internalizing it into the universe.  Hux takes himself seriously and throughout episode VII everyone else does too.\\n\\nWhen Rian brings the jokes about Hux across that barrier though and into the story\\, he's not JUST making a commentary about how ridiculous Hux is\\, he's also breaking the fourth wall and damaging the verisimilitude of the universe we came into the theater to escape into.  As long as he was left to be a fanatic that everyone else on screen took seriously we could look past it and our suspension of disbelief was maintained but the minute you use the narrative to point the finger directly at the blemish no one can stop seeing it.  The fantasy breaks down and now it's as though we're outside the cinema in the parking lot chatting about the movie instead of still lost to its otherworldliness.\\n\\nThe same direct communication with the audience crops up again and again\\, both visually and through dialogue\\, such as on the battlefield of Crait.  Resistance fighters fill trenches and a commander steps out looking for all the world like he's trying to recreate the pre-battle moment from Hoth with his binoculars raised to survey the approaching First Order forces across the flat white terrain.  The camera shifts to a trooper in the trenches who trails a finger through the white powder\\, leaving a red streak behind as it exposes the soil beneath.  He brings his finger to his lips and tastes it\\, then comments\\, \\\"Salt.\\\"  Again the director is speaking directly to us\\, without any subtlety at all\\, saying - \\\"This isn't Hoth.  It's not going to be anything like that.  I know you're expecting it and it sure looks like it... look even this guy looks just like that guy you remember... but this isn't that.\\\"\\n\\nAgain with the issue of Kylo's mask\\, Rian Johnson wants to have a word with you.  It's not just that Adam Driver is a more sympathetic villain whose motivations and inner conflict make for a compelling story when you can see his face - it's also that your esteemed director is bored with the Darth Vader obsession.  'Why must all these Dark Lords either be disfigured or wear masks?' he seems to ask in exasperation.  So he has Snoke use dialogue to critique the practice and it's mirroring of Vader's intimidating suit\\, and then has Kylo Ren smash the mask in a fit of rage after being scorned by his master.  Medbots later stitch up Kylo's scar so that it's not so obvious so that Johnson can say\\, \\\"See - isn't this better?  Sometimes evil doesn't look scary.  Sometimes it's magnetic and sympathetic.\\\"\\n\\nThe fact is that Johnson has a lot to say about Star Wars and about the world in general and rather than subtly weaving those elements into an immersive narrative he's busy using every device at his disposal to bludgeon the audience over the head with the message as though we're all to dull to catch it otherwise.\\n\\nEpisode VII left a number of threads dangling in the classic 'mystery box' style that J. J. Abrams has professed his love for.  Questions of Rey's parentage (Maz: \\\"Who's the girl?\\\")\\, Snoke's origin and rise to power\\, how Anakin's lightsaber re-emerged after it's tumble into the clouds of Bespin - all kept fans occupied for the two years since the force experienced an awakening.  The Last Jedi though wants to move on from all of those questions before they've even been explored.  They're not answered by tying up these loose ends\\, mind you - mostly they're answered by clipping them off and saying to the audience: 'This stuff?  None of it matters.\\\"\\n\\nRey's parents?  Nobody.  Rey is a nobody.  Snoke?  Just another looming bad guy\\, let's just cut him in half and be done with it.  The lightsaber?  Break it.  None of it matters.  As Kylo says to Rey - \\\"Let the past die.\\\"  Johnson it seems has in fact gone over to the dark side.  It is almost as though he is in such a hurry to move on to a galaxy without the relics of the past 40 years of the franchise that he's willing to burn the whole house down to clean the slate.\\n\\nNowhere is this more jarring to endure than in his resolution for the Skywalker dynasty.  Taken in total Episodes I-IX are purportedly the story of how Anakin Skywalker\\, once viewed as a long heralded messiah figure destroyed the Jedi Order\\, ushered in an era of tyranny and was eventually redeemed by his son Luke\\, who brought hope back to the Galaxy and renewed the promise of the Jedi.  But when the third arc in this galactic trilogy of trilogies starts we find out that things didn't exactly go according to plan\\, the Jedi haven't really returned\\, darkness is on the rise again and hope hangs by a thread.\\n\\nFrom a storytelling perspective this presents a problem\\, one that Abram's wrestled with but left unresolved in The Force Awakens.  How do you introduce a new cast of heroes for the next generation to grab hold of while still bringing back the luminaries of the last chapter?  How can we bring Luke\\, Leia and Han back together but not have them completely overshadow the new protagonists.  It's a fine tightrope to try and walk and the solution in Episode VII was essentially to make Han and Leia supporting characters for the new heroes and keep Luke off screen altogether to avoid the giant shadow he casts.\\n\\nThat's a fine solution that worked well enough - but once you start Episode VIII you're back to the central problem - how do we keep a focus on the new heroes without Luke's giant shadow swallowing them up?  The conventional wisdom said that he slips into the Obi-Wan role\\, training Rey to take up a mantle that he can no longer carry and maybe he goes out with a heroic\\, Obi-wan style end.  That was the expectation of many fans going into the film - but Rian Johnson is keen to subvert expectations as often as he can apparently.  So we find Luke not just a reluctant mentor\\, but also determined to be cut off from the force and to remove himself from the equation altogether.  \\\"I came here to die\\,\\\" he tells Rey.\\n\\nAnd die he does\\, on the island\\, as he intended.  He passes on less to her than Obi-Wan managed to pass on to him\\, and certainly much less than Yoda gave and continues to give in his surprise cameo on the island of Ach-to.  The epic confrontation with Kylo Ren on Crait notwithstanding\\, Luke is used by Rian primarily as a vehicle to discuss the failure of the Jedi religion.  Space Wizards failed\\, he says\\, and you shouldn't want to be one.  That's an interesting approach and one which in a different movie might have been really compelling\\, but half of the people sitting in those new comfy reclining seats the big theaters sport these days grew up wanting to be space wizards because of Luke.  They want to see the Jedi renewed.  Yes the Jedi Order failed\\, and that is a FANTASTIC discussion to have\\, but to cut the thread of Luke's involvement in the story at the end of the second movie\\, especially given the untimely passing of Carrie Fisher\\, leaves us hollowed out and unfulfilled.\\n\\n\\n\\\"Luke\\, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view...\\\"\\n\\nJohnson's heavy handed commentary isn't limited just to the problems he sees with the Star Wars Saga itself either.  He's also keen to tackle the heady social and political issues of our day through his lens.  First up on his agenda is to champion the battle of the new feminism against the old patriarchy.  The fact that the Resistance is led by two strong women\\, played by outstanding female actors is fantastic.  Indeed the farewell between Carrie Fisher and Laura Dern in the hanger bay is one of the most genuine and heartfelt moments in the entire film and with a different edit could have be the heart of the The Last Jedi.  Where Johnson goes from empowerment to crusade however is when he decides to infantalize Poe Dameron\\, having both of our heroines treat him with the condescending affection one might expect from a grandmother about to pinch the cheek of an unruly five year old and proclaim how cute he is when he's causing trouble.\\n\\nAgain when we come to Canto Bight we see that the writer\/director is unable to resist the need to editorialize through the film.  It isn't enough to have the fathiers tear through the place in a wild escape\\, no the event itself needs to be preceded by a passionate speech by rose chiding Finn and decrying war profiteering and the profligacy of the 'one percent.'  For a moment as her scene unfolds one wonders if her bitter commentary is being delivered in the Star Wars universe or in a Berkley classroom.  Johnson once again isn't content to let the symbolism stand on its own\\, but in his need to prop up Rose's otherwise superfluous character while at the same time getting the message across to what he must assume is a dullard-filled audience he makes sure to hammer the point home like a 1980s televangelist.\\n\\nGone entirely is the buoyant chemistry between Oscar Isaacs and John Boyega that caused Poe's character to be rewritten into a larger role in the first film.  Here he has been relegated to the bad puppy that needs to be scolded while Finn is lectured about inequality by a new character who was included... why again?  To act as the director's voice?  To provide a better X to Y chromosome ratio?  Indeed the only time Kelly Marie Tran's Rose really shines is on her introduction when she fanboys over Finn one moment and then unceremoniously stuns him the next.  In that moment she is fun\\, nuanced and looks like she could be a welcome addition to the team but throughout the Canto Bight sequences she seems to simply be a vehicle for laborious sermonizing.  Moreover her chemistry with Boyega's Finn never seems to materialize and certainly doesn't even come close to what we enjoyed between Isaacs and Boyega in The Force Awakens.  Over and over again we see this pattern repeated: we are presented with fantastic moments interrupted by or diminished with disappointment and heavy handed pontification.\\n\\nAt the end of the day\\, and at the end of the movie\\, this is one of the two mortal sins that define Rian Johnson's Star Wars apostasy.  It seems he just doesn't understand the secret incantations necessary to immerse an audience in another world.  Nowhere is his tone deafness more apparent however than in Leia's now infamous space flight back to safety.  To be clear: there is nothing about this scene that violates canon.  Nor does the idea of Leia using the force in such a fashion stretch credulity.  No the problem here\\, as with much of Johnson's work in The Last Jedi\\, is in the execution.  The scene just tries too hard - the crystals forming over Carrie Fisher's face\\, the lingering for just a moment too long on her apparently lifeless floating form\\, and the drifting over just slightly too far of a distance to get back to safety.  It all plays out like a song that's off tempo by just a hair and we knew as soon as we left the theater that a new 'Shooting Stars' meme starring our princess would be waiting for us by the time we got home.  (There were dozens by the time the weekend was over.)\\n\\nThe other unforgivable trespass\\, and the one which was arguably less egregious but probably caused more consternation was in Johnson's timing.  There are a number of decisions that had they been included in an Episode IX would probably have been welcomed and warmly embraced but placing them in the middle of the trilogy\\, as if trying to make a clean break on which to build something new\\, proved to be a bridge too far for much of the fandom.\\n\\nTake for instance the death of Supreme Leader Snoke.  Having Kylo Ren kill his own master not as an act of redemption but as a way to clear the table for his own rule is a fantastic story beat that would have been a welcome subversion in a dramatic closing chapter of the Saga.  What better way to end the entire Skywalker Saga than with a move like this?  But to do it in Episode VIII felt rushed\\, like skipping the important middle chapters of a book where the character development sets the stage for the pay off at the climax.  Or to have Luke experience his revelational moment with master Yoda - 'We are who they are meant to outgrow\\\" and to have that lead to a penultimate exertion of all of Luke's force powers in his galaxy spanning projection trick?  A brilliant conclusion to Luke's story if only it had happened in the final act of the play rather than in the midst of what should have been a secondary binding.\\n\\nLast but not least\\, consider the very last scene of Rian Johnson's movie.  Had we ended the entire trilogy\\, indeed the entire Skywalker Saga\\, with that fantastic moment where an unknown and orphaned slave shows us that the force is still with us and hope still remains it would have been embraced and heralded as a triumphant springboard to a whole new universe of adventures.  It would have been a perfect reset; Power finally having been wrested from the Skywalker dynasty and returned once more to where it was at the beginning: an unknown boy with an unknown past living a small and unremarkable life\\, unaware that destiny is ready to sweep him up at a moment's notice.  The scene stands however not as the final scene in the most remarkable saga in movie history but merely as the start of a two year intermission before the real finale.  The moment sits heavy and undigested\\, a premature denouement that leaves the audience confused and unfulfilled.  What does remain is the sense that Rian Johnson was so afraid to leave these potentially cathartic finales to the actual hands responsible for the finale that he rushed them into his own movie so that they wouldn't be lost or overturned by someone else's creative vision.\\n\\nThe Star Wars Saga is too mature and has too many people emotionally invested for any entry to escape criticism.  There will always be fans for whom the magic is gone with whatever the latest installment is.  Since Disney has made it clear they intend to keep the Star Wars factory churning out new films for as long as they can pull in $1 billion in ticket sales we will no doubt be party to internet shouting matches over Star Wars for years to come.\\n\\nThe Force Awakens was criticized as trading on nostalgia and fan service\\, not telling a new story of its own and that is a valid enough critique as far as it goes.  The Last Jedi on the other hand is desperately concerned with trying to be relevant\\, fresh and subversive - so much so that it forgets to let the audience just breathe in the fantasy of a galaxy filled with lasers and magic.  Having experienced both directions\\, I'll take shallow nostalgia and child-like wonder over ham-fisted crusading and condescension any day.  \\n\\nHopefully in the final chapter of the new trilogy J. J. Abrams can make a triumphant return and retcon or bandage over enough of the damage done by The Last Jedi to leave audiences satisfied with Dinsey's latest trilogy.  In the meantime I'm left wondering now if I want to see Rian Johnson's new trio of Star Wars films at all.  If it's more of what we saw this Christmas it might be the first set of Star Wars movies I ever pass on.","true":true}
