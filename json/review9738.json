Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good twists and turns\\, visually stunning but the writing was absolutely terrible\\, the original characters of the franchise were denatured and treated in the most superficial way - the whole movie felt quite superficial - and the overall chapter stands as an awesome slap in the face of original fans. This movie is actually quite comparable to The Phantom Menace in terms of shortcomings in the scenario\\, writing and rhythm. With this movie\\, Disney effectively killed Star Wars. It reshaped it into the story-telling it wants to do rather than respecting the nature of a Star Wars flick and the spirit of the original saga. The kids probably will not see the difference but real fans who grew up on Star Wars are bound to be disappointed.","true":true}
