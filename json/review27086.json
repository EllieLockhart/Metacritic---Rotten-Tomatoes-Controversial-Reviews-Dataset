Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the most profoundly baffling mysteries among the myriad of inexplicable decisions associated with The Last Jedi is why Disney would pay $4 billion for the Star Wars franchise only to destroy not just it's central character\\, but it's central mythos\\, in the most callous way possible? It was the cinematic equivalent of purchasing a mint condition vintage Star Wars action figure for thousands of dollars\\, promising the seller that you'll treasure it as much as they have\\, and promptly filming a YouTube video of yourself unboxing the figure and blowing it up with a firecracker while you cackle maniacally.\\n\\nMany people would think that such an act was hilarious and awesome\\, because the nerds who get worked up about that trash need to grow up and learn that they're just toys. I\\, on the other hand\\, would wonder why anyone would feel the need to be so judgmental and so extravagantly cruel\\, simply because you yourself don't see the value in another person's harmless enjoyment. That was precisely the question I found myself asking after viewing The Last Jedi.","true":true}
