Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not even a real Star Wars movie.. They murdered Luke and the force.. One of the biggest disappointments for a movie ever.. Thank god JJ is directing the last one because this guy ruined what should've been an amazing movie.. Leia flying through space are you kidding me? Jedi master Luke attempting to murder his nephew in his sleep? Get this garbage out of here. The casino seen was awful as well.. If you aren't a star wars fan you might like this movie but I cannot understand how a real fan could approve of this. Luke's acting was awful as well\\, probably because he knew this movie sucked.","true":true}
