Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I literally signed up to be able to post a down vote for this movie. That is how much the movie motivated me. I know it is a harsh thing to rate a movie this poorly\\, however I believe the movie that earned it. I can go on and on about how many things were wrong such as plotholes\\, horrible characters\\, lack of story\\, etc. The fact that this movie claims to be a Star Wars movie is a farce. However\\, I do encourage those that enjoy tween movies such as divergent\\, twilight\\, and the like because that is what this movie essentially is. If you want an intriguing story with fun characters this is not the movie for you. If you are a child under the age of 15 then you will enjoy this. Otherwise stay in a galaxy far\\, far\\, away from this.","true":true}
