Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As someone who saw the original in theaters\\, this new chapter is mostly thoughtfully written and acted\\, incorporating characters that reflect an ideal of a modern group of heroes who include (OMG!) STRONG WOMEN! The horror! Seriously\\, this is the first remake that I have seen multiple times as an adult and my kids want to join - even my girly pre-teen daughter. It\u2019s fun\\, don\u2019t miss it.","true":true}
