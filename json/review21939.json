Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just saw this movie \\, and people who underrated this movie is no true Star Wars fan! Y\u2019all might as well write your own story and bootleg your own movie . It has its flaws but this is better than the force awakens ","true":true}
