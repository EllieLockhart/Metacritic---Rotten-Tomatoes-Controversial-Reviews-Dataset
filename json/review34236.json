Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"That's the problem when you make the film political\\, you offend everyone:\\n\\na) To appeal to the right\\, SW killed the interracial relationship between Finn and Rey -- that's the whole reason why Finn and Rose was in a meaningless wild goose chase so they can bond and Kylo and Rey would develop instead.\\n\\nb) To appeal to the left\\, women are in charge and serve as commanders\\, and guys were made to look bad (Poe)\\n\\nOther issues I have with the film:\\n- Shameless addition of unnecessary cute characters so Disney can sell loads of toys\\n- Didn't do justice to Luke Skywalker's character\\n- Hate fake CGI effects\\n- Trying hard to be funny like Marvel films","true":true}
