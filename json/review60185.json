The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"After 7 years of anticipation for the next chapter in this series that many avid gamers such as myself who hold the original in such high regard\\, this mediocre attempt of a sequel tarnishes the original's legacy and decides to bash the players over the head with its ham-fisted political agenda and ideologies. The plot is contrived and tries to be cleverer than it actually is. The old characters are either a shell of their former selves or are just completely different from what they were before and make dumb decisions. The new characters are either bland\\, one dimensional or just plain terrible and any chance of any of them developing is short lived. As a longtime fan of Naughty Dog and all their works\\, I have never lost respect for a developer as quickly as I did for Naughty Dog. They should be ashamed of themselves for blatant false advertising in the trailer\\, having the trailers deceive fans into believing that  they will go on the journey as Ellie with Joel by her side. FALSE Joel is barely even in the game and the scenes he is in are just pointless flashbacks and not to mention that you only play as Ellie for only half of the game\\, more or less. The absolute nerve the developers had to try and pull a page out of Kojima's book and have the player play as a character that they despise and think that you'll grow to empathise with her is something that will go down in gaming history as one of the worst decisions of gaming development. The reason why the switch worked more for Kojima is pretty simple: Raiden didn't kill any beloved characters. Gender and identity politics have no place in being in a game like this. In a world ravaged by a deadly fungus and infected \\, survival and knowing whom to trust or not to\\, are the most paramount things to care about in the game's world\\, not what your gender or sexual orientation is. If this is the route that lies in wait for the new generation of gaming that is approaching then I will no longer be apart of this community. True gamers like myself play these games as a form of escapism\\, not to be bogged down with political messaging that's about as subtle as using gasoline to put out a fire. If you loved everything about the original game then you'll be doing yourself a favour by not buying this game\\, or hell even renting it. I have never written a review or anything like this on these types of sites but the way this game affected me for the wrong reasons I just had to put my thoughts into words. RIP Joel\\, you deserved better\u2026 Expand","true":true}
