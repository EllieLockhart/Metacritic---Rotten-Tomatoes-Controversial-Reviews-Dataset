Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Made an account here to review this movie. I was feeling really down after seeing this\\, and a friend of mine sent me a link to the How It Should Have Ended of this movie. It was hilarious and cheered me up\\, but it really drove home how inexplicably dumb so many of the decisions the characters made were. But the real killer for me was how they turned Luke from an indefatigable\\, optimistic hero into a moping weird milk drinking loser who turned his back on the jedi\\, his friends\\, and the entire galaxy. No plot holes from force awakens were resolved\\, and plenty more were opened. Really heartbreaking to see what they did with the characters I grew up loving. Some of the cinematography was beautiful\\, and John Williams deserves a mention. Aside from that\\, just so disappointing in so many ways.","true":true}
