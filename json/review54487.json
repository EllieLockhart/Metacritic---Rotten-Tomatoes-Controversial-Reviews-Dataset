Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Kathleen Kennedy and zer BDSM slave Rian Johnson transformed Star Wars in zeir personal safe space in which every single non binary gender\\, every skin color\\, every ethnicity is represented.\\nZey used 99% of zeir time to fill minority quotas with empty characters often choosing the less attractive or fit in order not to offend bulimic or anorexic moviegoers and also people suffering from dismorfofobia.\\nIn doing so\\, zey unfortunately forgot to write an actual story for the movie.\\nZey also did not realize that normal people\\, I mean people who don't lose their time inventing ways to be derided\\, will not pay to see another shitty movie like this.\\nRainbow poop is still poop.","true":true}
