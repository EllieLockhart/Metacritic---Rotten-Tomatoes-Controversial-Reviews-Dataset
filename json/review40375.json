Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is rotten\\, no StarWars vibe at all! The killing of all original StarWars characters that made the original trilogy interesting like Akbar and Luke has reduced the interest into the whole new franchise for me.  The script was dirt\\, the new characters are dirt\\, the so-called comedy is dirt\\, heck it makes me think Disney has gone to dirt to allow a pathetic pointless script that makes the first movie irrelevant go to film.  Delete these two films from the StarWars universe\\, they are the rot of the franchise. The stories in the Bioware game StarWars The Old Republic hold more canon than this tripe. ","true":true}
