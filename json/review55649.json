Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Now we have confirmation Lucasfilm have no idea of the story of the whole trilogy... It seems director make his movie\\, then the next one make his movie...\\n\\nEverything set up by Abrams\/Kasdan was already poor in TFA (Empire bis\\, Snoke\\, Resistance\\, New Republic blow up\\, Rey's parentage) but whatever because Johnson delete all of this.\\n\\nEverything is wasted : \\n- Snoke : who is he\\, what is he\\, motivations\\, etc...\\n- Luke : his legacy\\, his background between ROTJ and TFA... the only moment he shines is his projection... what the hell did they do to you Luke\\n- Rey's parentage : they tease you this with vision\\, dialogue\\, acting but at the end\\, we don't care\\n- The story : plot is BAD... we have to escape ship and we have no gas... OH MY GOD... where is the story there ? Do you have an idea of the story of this trilogy Lucasfilm ??? I don't even talk about subplot with Finn and the annoying Rose which is really bad\\, well executed and no one cares about what happened there\\n- Music : really meh\\, no new memorable themes like in prequels or OT (except Rey's theme and Jedi Steps but they are over present\\, normal it's the only one... John Williams is on automatic mode)\\n- Leia is wasted as well... why did you bring the old cast to do that ? Just for fan service (look Han's fate\\, it was poor executed his death)\\n- Benicio is wasted\\, Phasma once again\\n- Hux is now a caricature et serves as comic relief\\, wow great\\n- So much incoherence for the main story plot or the subplot\\, the story is weak...\\n\\n+ Rey is good\\, as Kylo Ren and their relation is good\\n+ Poe is enjoyable","true":true}
