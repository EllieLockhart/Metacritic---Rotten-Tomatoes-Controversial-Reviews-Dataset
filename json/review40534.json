Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the Star Wars movie you didn't know you were looking for.\\nPacked with many memorable moments and great performances.\\nMark Hamill is award worthy for his portrayal of Luke Skywalker.\\nALSO I LOVE THE PORGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!","true":true}
