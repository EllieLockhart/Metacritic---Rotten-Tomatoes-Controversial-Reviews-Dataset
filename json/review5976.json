Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing story telling and the weakest Star Wars film by far.   Basically\\, Kylo kills the main bad guy so he is now the main bad guy\\, and the resistance continues to get its butt kicked.   The writers just discarded Snoke without any explanation or pretense. Luke who bravely tried to turn Darth Vader is now revealed to be a cowardly wimp who contemplated killing his own nephew because he could sense darkness in him.    Luke does do the cool force projection thing but then just dies for no special reason.  The whole casino planet\/ code breaker sequence was seemingly wasted time with very little apparent impact on the plot.  In fact the plot of the overall triology advanced very little.","true":true}
