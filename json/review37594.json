{"101487":178416,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is no justification at all for the half star reviews that people are giving this movie. I don't not understand what all the hate is about at all. Seriously\\, exactly what was everyone expecting? I'm not sure. But I enjoyed that movie very much. Frankly as far cinematography goes\\, this is easily some of the best the series has ever had. Johnson knows how to use colors to paint a very pretty picture\\, and boy was this one pretty. The visuals are outstanding throughout the entire movie.\\n\\nAnother thing that this movie did incredibly well in my opinion at least\\, was develop these new characters much more than they had in the force awakens. Kylo is a very unique villain\\, in my opinion Driver really nails the inner conflict going on with the character\\, while expanding that conflict an awful lot in this one. As for Rey\\, the reveal about who her parents are may have upset a lot of people\\, but I thought it was perfect\\, it fits the theme of the movie well. She's one of us\\, I'd rather have a nobody than some privileged prince or heir of Jedi lineage be the hero. Fin and Rose\\, why does everyone hate fin and rose? I know why\\, and so do the rest of you when you look at these reviews. Frankly people\\, leave that crap in the past. I'm someone who doesn't appreciate movies going \\\"all-inclusive\\\" just for the sake of being inclusive\\, but I really\\, really\\, don't think these characters should be looked at by the colors of their skin. They have purpose\\, Fin is an ex-storm trooper\\, he's the inside man\\, he has a real purpose\\, especially in this one. Rose may not be the biggest character on screen but she brings a love triangle to the movies that could play out interestingly in the final movie. Honestly\\, the way these characters grew in this film was some of the best character development I've seen throughout the series. \\n\\nIt was a lot of what I wanted\\, as in NOT the same damn thing over and over again. It's incredibly original as far as Star Wars films go. Mark Hamill's acting is awesome\\, there is a scene when Luke sees R2-D2 for the first time since he exiled himself\\, and Hamill's reaction is perfect\\, it's the good old Luke Skywalker of the original's. Oh yeah\\, and Poe\\, Poe get's so much more development and screen time in this compared to TFA\\, how can you not like Poe? He's not Han Solo\\, but he's a great character. Maybe one of my favorites of the new cast.\\n\\nNow this is where a lot of Star Wars \\\"fans\\\" should be ashamed of themselves\\, Carrie Fisher...she gives a really\\, really\\, great and strong performance as Leia. I'm frankly upset that the last movie won't be featuring her the way they intended. Honestly Star Wars fans\\, this was Carrie Fisher's last movie of all time\\, one in which she gives a great performance\\, and you're really going to disrespect her by leaving unjustified half-star reviews? It's more than a little upsetting. It's vile. \\n\\nI just don't get the hate for this movie. I really don't\\, it had some of the most imaginative creatures in a while sprinkled throughout and some beautiful new worlds\\, particularly Crait. The action was well directed as well\\, and frankly\\, Laura Dern's last scene in this movie is one of the coolest moments I've seen in any of these movies. I really don't know what people were expecting. Some people seem to just hate the inclusiveness\\, other's can't get it through their head that the expanded universe never has and never will be truly canon. Something I'm VERY glad they refuse to ever incorporate into the movies. \\n\\nThis movie will not be what you were expecting\\, and that's exactly what I hoped it wouldn't be. This is no empire strikes back remake\\, it's own film\\, and a very good one at that.","true":true}
