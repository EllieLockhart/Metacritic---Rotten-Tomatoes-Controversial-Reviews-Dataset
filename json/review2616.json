Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awesome movie! Great character development of Kylo and Rey! Great action sequences\\, the imperial ships looked amazing. Don't be swayed by bad audience reviews. This is a great star wars movie and among the best. See it on the big screen\\, visually worth the ticket.","true":true}
