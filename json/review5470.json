Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite what the fanboys (and they are\\, almost invariably\\, boys) are saying\\, I enjoyed this movie overall. Granted\\, there were a few curious choices made\\, and the film was not as cohesive as The Force Awakens. Still\\, these were ultimately in service of the characters' progression (and\\, in terms of character development\\, this was one of the more realistic Star Wars films). A worthy addition to the new trilogy.","true":true}
