Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Deconstructionist drivel shrouded in extraordinary special effects.  With all the money spent on this film\\, why didn't anyone bother to pay for a REAL screenplay?  As bad of a story as the acting was in the prequels.  Abrams is a cheap shot hack.  This was so bad I will not go to the final movie.  I AM SO DISAPPOINTED!!!!!","true":true}
