Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ugh. Such a bad movie. As someone who watch Star Wars in the theater in 1977 this movie is the absolute worst of the lot. It upends the franchise with an almost irreverent glee and lines in the movie almost seem like a manifesto (or at least a middle finger) to the audience. As I write this it is almost May 2018 and I STILL haven't bought or even watched this movie for a second time. From the social messages (keep that in Star Trek) to Luke's destruction of a character to just stupid writing\\, The Last Jedi is The First Movie in the Star Wars franchise to really suck.","true":true}
