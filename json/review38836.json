Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They had years to craft an engaging story that captured the magic and imagination of the original series. But they ended up subverting everything that makes Star Wars what it is: charismatic characters that share a rapport amongst themselves and the audience\\, a sense of scale and magnitude that somehow makes you feel both insignificant and engaged\\, and whimsical fascination with the outcome of the story. None of these were true with The last Jedi. There were some entertaining moments\\, but nothing memorable. This installment made me care less about the new characters\\, and did not do justice to the original cast (at all)! But\\, Disney has set itself up nicely to make a lot of money through toy sales...apparently it\u2019s movies are now simply part of a mass marketing campaign that gives more weight to toy sales than it does to character development. Such a disappointment.","true":true}
