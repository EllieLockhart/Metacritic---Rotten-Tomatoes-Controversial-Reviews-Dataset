Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Oh\\, MY GOD\\, the story is a mess. As an aspiring writer and someone with a long attention span\\, it hurt my body and soul to watch this catastrophe. Nothing that happened in this movie earned itself. The best way I can describe the plot is thus\\, shit happened and stuff blew up. No really\\, that's the entire plot. There is no exposition\\, no character development\\, and no sense to be found in the script. Given all the talent and effort that went into the creation of this movie it's like watching the most magnificent train ever constructed leave the station\\, subsequently derail and explode\\, and still be heralded as the most marvelous thing to have left a crater. My most heartfelt condolences to the cast and crew of The Last Jedi for having been involved.\\n\\nMy hat goes off to Disney for having made a worse Star Wars movie than The Phantom Menace. As for the \\\"critics\\\"\\, I want to know what they are smoking and how much Disney is paying them to write those glowing reviews.","true":true}
