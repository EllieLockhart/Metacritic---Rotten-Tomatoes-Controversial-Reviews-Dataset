Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved pretty much everything about this movie. Will be going for a second viewing\\, which is very rare for me! Loved Luke\u2019s story arc and ending\\, as well as all the side stories going on. A little long for my taste\\, but that\u2019s just a tiny complaint for an overall satisfying and solid Star Wars movie. ","true":true}
