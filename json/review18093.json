Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought about calling this movie a dumpster fire\\, but then I saw an actual dumpster fire and realized that it was more entertaining than this plotless\\, agenda driven money grab.\\n\\nAlso\\, what's up with the audience score apparently being frozen?  I obviously didn't look at 178\\,000 fan reviews individually\\, but a quick scan of the most recent couple hundred or so makes me think that 49% is optimistic at best and mathematically implausable at worst.","true":true}
