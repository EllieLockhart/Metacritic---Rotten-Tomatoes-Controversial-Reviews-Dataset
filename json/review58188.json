Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You can tell that the director is trying his best\\, but the writing needed a third point of view and the contribution of a few real Star Wars fans. Rehashing old ideas and throwing in a few new pieces of flair (executioner Stormtroopers? Shiny trooper leader? Big ship that is shaped like two pizza slices put together?) just doesn't cut it.\\n\\nThey need fresh young minds to help craft the next generation of Star Wars movies\\, reusing past ideas and action sequences is getting old fast.","true":true}
