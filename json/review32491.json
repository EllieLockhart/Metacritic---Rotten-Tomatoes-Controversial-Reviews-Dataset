Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars!! Rain Johnson did a phenomenal job. Great story and cinematography. Standouts are Driver and Ridley. Really wish they toned down the 'fan-service\\\" though. I think they thought they were Marvel for a second. However the epic moments and plot twists are able to overcome all of the Marvel Shenanigans. Still one of the best Star Wars movies to date.","true":true}
