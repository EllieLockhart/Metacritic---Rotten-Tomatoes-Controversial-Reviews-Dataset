Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't wtch it! Disney has ruined Star Wars\\, and this will be the last one I'll ever watch. I hate the characters\\, and everything is overhyped. The new movies have ruined what Star Wars once was. Extremely disappointed.","true":true}
