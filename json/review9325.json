Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Geez\\, last time I saw this kinda trash I was taking out the garbage.\\n\\nThis was:\\nNot fun\\nNot Star Wars\\nUninspired\\nOnly superficial storyline\\nBad (overreacting) acting (General Hux)\\nToo much emotions where none should be\\n\\nThis had:\\nOne great scene with Luke and Rey\\nWorse costumes (gotta sell those toys right Disney?)\\nToo much \\\"funny\\\" kids jokes pressed into what should be serious scenes. *Flashback to Jar Jar stepping in poop*\\n\\nYou should be ashamed Disney.\\nLuke may say \\\"It is time for the Jedi to end\\\"\\nbut this movie made me acctually thing:\\n\\\"It's time for the star wars saga to end\\\".","true":true}
