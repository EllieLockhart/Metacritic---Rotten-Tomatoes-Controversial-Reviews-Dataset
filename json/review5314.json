Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Definitely one of the best Star Wars movies so far. Without giving away too much\\, I was a little disappointed in the answers that were provided\\, and really only left more questions\\, which we will probably never know the answers to.  But still\\, visually\\, emotionally and story-wise\\, one of the best!","true":true}
