Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As an X-Wing series and Heir to the Empire - Thrawn Trilogy Fan\\, I hate seeing this type of film and sub-par writing doing such damage to a universe of unlimited potential.  I fail to see how paper thin villains\\, cringe worthy mom jokes\\, and a dozen teeth gritting scenes advance the genre or expand the fan base.  What's tragic is the amount of material and writing talent that already existed and was simply discarded as unwanted.  I don't think a single objective person could read the Timothy Zhan\\, Michael Stackpole\\, or Aaron Allston's stories and not cry at the opportunities which have been squandered by the new trilogy.  \\nAs a sign of my objectivity\\, I graded Rogue One 4.5 stars and Solo 3.5 stars.  \\nMy hope is this latest trilogy is simply spun off as an alternate universe and some of the great \\\"Legends\\\" writers are brought onboard for story consulting and canonical veto authority.","true":true}
