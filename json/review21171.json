Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was very entertained\\, that graphics was nice but....the storyline did not make sense at all to me.  It seemed like the director just threw every idea that came to mind  into one movie.  I'm giving it a star because I was entertained\\, a movie can go on for so long before I get tired of watching\\, and another star for graphics and the animals and scenery and one more star that will equal 3 stars just because I am a star wars fan.","true":true}
