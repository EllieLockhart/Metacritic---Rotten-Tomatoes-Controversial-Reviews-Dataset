{"101487":163483,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Problems: Pacing (let scenes breath\\, I hated the constant back and forth between storylines especially when they don't coincide in time)\\, inappropriate humor\\, lack of exposition for key characters -> lack of emotional investment in anything\\, progressive agenda is too obvious\/ takes you out of story and into metaphor land\\, worthless storylines (Fin and Rose)\\, purple haired lesbian (not there to be a hero\\, but to seek light- Leia... fucking cringeworthy dialogue)\\, Rose character isn't well thought out or well acted- her last line is fucking stupid as fuck\\, technology in the universe felt conveniently capable and incapable at times\\, wtf is Luke Skywalker's deal re: destroying Jedi order? Just seems unbelievable given his history. The story is lame as fuck.\\n\\nEverything seems too convenient and simple\\, made it feel childish. Ex: I thought Leia was against targeting the dreadnaught? After Poe's improbable  destruction of all defense weaponry\\, he simply calls up the rebel fleet and bombers out of nowhere into a suicide run. All of a sudden we're supposed to forget that Leia was against targeting the ship... they get hammered because for some reason they come as a bunch (easy to pick off)... just seems simple and simplistic for the sake of making it obvious to children what is going on- like the entire movie. Completely lacking storytelling nuance in every way conceivable. \\n\\nThis wasn't really a space opera\\, more of a kid's Disney film w a Star Wars wrapper. Rian Johnson is no JJ Abrams and tension and pacing were pretty garbage. Snoke's reveal is shit\\, in fact all scenes w\/ him aren't interesting. Who the fuck is he anyways... \\n\\nRian Johnson is to blame. Made The Force Awakens and Rogue One look great and the prequels look downright genius by comparison.","true":true}
