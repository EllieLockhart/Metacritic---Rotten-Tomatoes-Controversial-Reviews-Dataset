Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are clearly some huge problems in the movie\\, real blunders in the screenplay surrounded by some nonsense\\, but this is a well done and new movie for the saga! Is clearly a good movie and set an interesting overture for the final episode...As the middle child\\, it is difficult to continue with the story without closing it\\, but this is exactly what it is beautifully done in the movie. The 50% of people who did not like it are probably old fans of star wars but they have to accept that the past is gone\\, and it would be stupid and pointless to keep doing the same thing over and over....also\\, it would be insulting to remake starwars saga and futile...this is a dark episode and shocking\\, is it the trauma of destroying an old building and construct something new\\, of course you can still argue that there are some terrible parts in the movie but if you look at the big picture it is great! finally something new and well done!! now\\, everything depends on the third movie....it could be the cherry on top of the cake or make everything falling down","true":true}
