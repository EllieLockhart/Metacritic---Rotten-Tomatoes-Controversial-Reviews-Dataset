Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't quite understand the negative feelings toward TLJ... I'm looking at Episodes VII - IX as a trilogy\\, each with their own part to play. We may not understand the parts each character is playing through the whole thing\\, or why certain scenes happen (bigger picture)\\, but does that make them BAD scenes? \\\"The characters wasted their time!!!\\\" So what! Was it a fun ride? Yes!  Was it well-written? Yes! Thought provoking? Yes! Outside the box a bit? Yes! Full-circle on some accounts? Yes! There was only one thing I tilted my head at (glug glugh)\\, but everything else was lost in the thrill of the ride. As a lifelong Star Wars fan (Class of '77) and definite \\\"fanboy\\\"\\, I can pick apart anything\\, sure\\, but I'd rather sit back\\, relax\\, and enjoy the show\\, not get pissed over why they didn't do that\\, why did they do this\\, etc... This could have been ten minutes shorter\\, this could have been ten minutes longer... Were you entertained? Will you watch it again? Was it better than any of the prequels? Ummmmm.... yes.... I enjoyed this better than Force Awakens\\, personally\\, and felt that it was right up there with the original trilogy. We need to stop comparing these new films to the idealized memories we have of Star Wars films\\, fan fiction\\, and what should\/could be... Just go and watch these damned good films! If they weren't Star Wars - take away all of the trappings - you would all be drooling and wondering where the hell these films came from!","true":true}
