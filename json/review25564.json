Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a bad movie\\, but also not a good one. As per usual\\, the special effects and combat sequences are excellent. The imagery (red and black in Snoke\u2019s throne room) looks great and some of the humor added a nice touch to the movie. In contrast however\\, some of the humor seemed very forced. Almost similar to the wise cracks you would see in a Marvel movie. The character development was not very good and pieces of the story seemed to be there just to take up space. Most of the questions I had at the end of The Force Awakens were left unanswered\\, but that is not saying they can\u2019t expand upon it in the final movie. The bottom line is\\, if you\u2019re a fan of Star Wars it is still worth seeing\\, however I would not classify it as one of the stronger entries in the series.","true":true}
