Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After a few viewings I can say this is my favorite star wars after the originals.  Luke's character arc is both tragic and awe inspiring and easily the best part of the movie. This was the star wars I was hoping would come after episode 7 in every way.. a more cerebral story with the least hand holding of any star wars movie yet.. it feels like this movie was made for people that grew up with SW and know it inside and out and wanted something much less predictable and typical of the franchise.. and yet it still feels like Star Wars in every way. This movie has me excited for the future of the franchise..  Episode 8 blew it wide open - now anything can happen and nothing is predictable - exactly as it should be!","true":true}
