Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am doubly amazed here 1st I think this could be the best Star Wars Movie yet\\, but my favorite will always be New Hope.  I was 10 when I saw it and it was pure MOVIE MAGIC\\,  Thank you George Lucas.\\nThis movie passed the torch on to the next generation of fans. Carrie is dead\\, Harrison finally got his wish and Han is now dead.  Luke can still come back as ghost or something.\\nNow kids my daughter age (10) can start fresh with their own Star Wars Stories.\\n My little girl loved it\\, Rey is her Leia and the Story gets to live on with a new YOUNGER cast and new generation of fans.\\nThe 2nd thing that amazes me is how extremely harsh and mean the reviews by the fans are??? \\nBut when I talk to anyone in person that has seen the movie they loved it and they do not understand why such harsh reviews.\\nIs Russia screwing with us again??  It is one thing to mess with our politic and our democracy but DON'T MESS WITH STAR WARS!!!!\\nMaybe if these reviews are true then maybe these people are die hard Luke\\, Leia and Han solo fans that cannot accept the change.  I have read many of the review and I do not see or agree with most of what  a lot are saying in the reviews.\\nAs for some what I do see\\, so what\\, it is just a movie meant for you to escape for 2 or 3 hrs. that all.\\nThey have ruined a great and rare movie experience for themselves and now they are trying to ruin it for everyone else.\\nIn the Movie theater is escapism\\, fun and good times.  Outside the theater the real world life.\\nIn immortal words of that great Captain Kirk  \\\"Get a life!!\\\"\\nGo see the movie\\, get the popcorn and soda and have a good time.  It is really good and a lot of fun!!","true":true}
