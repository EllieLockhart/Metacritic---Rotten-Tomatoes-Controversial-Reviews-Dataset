Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved TLJ\\, it hit all the marks I hoped to see and brought more women to speaking roles than I expected. I grew up in the 70's and Carrie Fisher was my Princess and Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill my earliest crushes. The passing of the lightsaber is difficult to watch at times as my oldest friends fade into the Force\\, but these new rebels are just as gutsy and willing to hop in a ship and blow some stuff up. I can hardly wait for the next movie to see where the new rebel alliance takes us.","true":true}
