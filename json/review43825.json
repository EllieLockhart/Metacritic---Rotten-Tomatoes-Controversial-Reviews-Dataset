Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This white hot dumpster fire has pretty much no redeeming qualities (outside of the special effects)\\, basically zero plot\\, doesn't connect any dots from previous movies in any rewarding\/satisfying way. It's essentially a practical joke aimed at anyone that's enjoyed any of the past movies and the 40+ years of lore built around them. PS. I've never rated a single movie on here in the entirety of Rotten Tomatoes existence.... That's how bad this movie is.","true":true}
