Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The entire plot of the film made no sense. I was brought to laughter at some scenes that were meant to be serious and emotional because the writing was so absurd. I don't know how\\, with all the money and resources available to Disney\\, that they were able to turn out such an awful finished product.","true":true}
