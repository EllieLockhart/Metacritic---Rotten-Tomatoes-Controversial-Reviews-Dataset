Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"worst ever. please do not make any more\\, I would go into how bad you did but there are thousands of reviews stating it. But if you were ever to see this Did you  watch and understand why the first movies gained a following. You shitted on it all. With a gift to direct a film such as this we would all like to know what your plot lines were. direction of character development .. no other movie I see directed by you will I ever watch","true":true}
