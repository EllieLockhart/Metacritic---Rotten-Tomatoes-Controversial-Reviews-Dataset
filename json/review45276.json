Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Upon first seeing this movie\\, I was reasonably pleased with it\\, but unfortunately\\, when you actually take the time to think about what you just saw the cracks begin to show on this one\\, and you cant unsee them. First up this new film is really doing all it can to give the finger to the long term fans of this series. Everything you might have loved is being given the shaft and has been replaced with political correctness and social justice virtue signaling. I have no objections to a cast of diverse ethnic groups\\, but I dont like people being cast just BECAUSE they are a diverse ethnic person. How about you try hiring the best actors who have the best chemistry and see where the chips fall. Movie by ethnic and gender quota apparently leaves little room for basic things like plot\\, story continuity\\, the laws of physics\\, or even having interesting characters doing interesting things that actually service the story. Having Finn and Rose on some stupid pointless trip to \\\"look isnt Trump evil\\\" land that had no payoff and no point was a complete waste of time. Laura Derns character was also such a caricature and who the heck was her costume designer\\, since that thing she had on her neck made her look like a giraffe or lolipop with that awful hair. Her pointless refusal to share her plan with her subordinates not only makes no military sense\\, but was so transparent that her only purpose was to put Poe in his place. To tell the man to shut up and do what he is told by the smarter woman. What a joke. It created conflict for the sake of conflict that not only didnt move the plot along\\, but was actually counterproductive to the narrative. Having Luke essentially betray everything he ever stood for was also such a great way to say thank you to the fans who have stuck by this series for 40 years!!! Anyone can come in a destroy something because apparently it is edgy to deconstruct things that have strength and character and heart. This movie did a huge disservice to Luke and should be ashamed of itself. Mary poppins Leia was also quite unnecessary. What this movie did manage to get right was Kylo and Rey. The acting was tight\\, the concept was well conceived and executed very nicely. The fight with the Praetorian guard was epic. The conflict\\, each trying to turn the other and the chemistry between the actors was great and will pretty much be the only thing that I watch this movie again for. Note to Disney- please get a new director who is capable of crafting a tight plot that doesnt have holes that you can drive a truck through\\, who understands character and is capable of leaving his social justice crap at the door and is just there to make a great movie with the best people instead of filing some sort of quota for ethnic\/feminism propaganda. If you tell a good story well\\, people will not care what color or gender the cast is\\, if you craft your story around filling a gender\/ethnic quota you end up with a sloppy story that has no point\\, like this train wreck. but hey we are supposed to applaud them for being so inclusive. Stop worrying about inclusivity and checking boxes and just tell a good story!","true":true}
