Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a Star Wars fans since ROTJ when I was 4 years old. I love Star Wars! The prequals\\, while not great\\, still had the essence of a Star Wars story. RO was good and the other two films by Disney were average best. But I will never\\, ever watch this dumpster fire of a film again! It was two and one half hours of horrible writing\\, acting\\, and directing with a story that goes literally no where.  It insults the fans who have loved this before franchise for over 40 years and I hold the horrible director personally responsible. He wanted half the fans to like it and the other half to hate it and yet he calls us names for expressing our displeasure with his product\\, he's not a bright individual. I still love Star Wars and I hope we get better films in the future but as of now this new Trilogy is done in my eyes and I won't be watching IX because VIII has left me disinterested in the rest of the pointless story","true":true}
