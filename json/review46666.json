Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Way to ruin the franchise...  obviously trying to reset\\, get rid of the old cast\\, and start greenfield...  just wish it could have been done with a scalpel instead of a hacksaw","true":true}
