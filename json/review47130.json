Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a let down. The Luke sendoff\\, mediocre sitcom like humor\\, Ray growing with absolutly no training\\, Mary Popins\\, there was action\\, battle scenes\\, fight scenes which were enjoyable\\, but overall the bad overshadowed the good\\, potential of this movie was lost.","true":true}
