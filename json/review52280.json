Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A giant\\, dull\\, unenthusiastic meh. Disney PR is pushing this new\\, risky\\, divisive meme like they tried something fresh. They did not. The master was reluctant to train again. The pupil ran off early again. The good guys flee again. The At At assault on the white planet happens at the end of the movie instead of the beginning to really shake things up.\\n\\nWe are in the some spot as the end of the last movie. Rey is the all powerful good guy who we already know can easily beat the bad guy Kylo. They have no answer for Snoke or why the empire off shoot has overthrown the new republic.\\n\\n When people talk about trying different things\\, being weird\\, and the outlier for Star Wars films\\, they are talking about story teases and set ups they didn't have the guts to pull the trigger on. Nothing new\\, weird\\, or fundamentally different lasts more than 10 minutes\\, and the film always quickly returns to safety. \\n\\n\\nIt is derrivative of Empire and Battlestar Galactica with no new novel ideas for it's time and had none of the plot turns those stories had.","true":true}
