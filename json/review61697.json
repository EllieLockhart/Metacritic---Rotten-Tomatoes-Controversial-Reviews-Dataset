I just finished the game and the story just seems forced and the plot seems like it was not given much thought considering how the first game was delivered to the audience in such a masterful way. The game play is very similar to the first one so I don't see how this can be the game of a generation. The graphics andI was a big fan of The Last Of Us I have played it over and over again.

The graphics and fighting is amazing but the story was a let down and not just because of the death of one of the main characters. Streets of Rage 4 should get more hype then this game. I play it online and with my daughter on a weekly basis it is an awesome game on the higher difficulty levels. STREETS OF RAGE 4 GET IT! You also cannot compare this game to Red dead redemption 2.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
