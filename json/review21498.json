Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would not recommend seeing in theatres and honestly wait untill you can watch it at home. I'm not sure how they continue to ignore what the fans actually want which is more Jedi lore. The actual story is borring and is consistently a rehash of the original.","true":true}
