Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The shine wears off from this film very quickly. There are many things in this film that won't stand up to the test of time and audiences won't be watching The Last Jedi in 20 years time still in gasping awe. \\n\\nThe films comedy falls flat and is inconsistant with most of the film. The pacing is wrong. This is another block buster movie to cut pivotel story telling moments in order to fill in time with a superfluous sub plot. \\n\\nThere is even an incredibly nauseating love speech with plunges The lAst Jedi down to the depths of day time soap operas. \\n\\nFinally about Luke. We have been dying to see Luke since The Force Awakens but this depiction of Luke is foreign. The director Rian Johnson shows us that he didnt understand Luke character and what the ending of Return of the Jedi meant.","true":true}
