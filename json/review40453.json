Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the first Star Wars film in history that I have seen and it left me with disengagement and native energy. Poor writing\\, lack of direction for the trilogy and forced humor that zones you out from the movie.","true":true}
