Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best mid-trilogy movies I have ever seen. Rian created a world that could lead to endless possibilities in episode IX. I would highly recommend watching it more than once to recognize and appreciate the subtle direction the film pulls you in: especially the story line with Poe. \\n\\nMark Hamill and Adam Driver give amazing performances\\, and while John Boyega was given the weakest story line he shines through. While Daisy Ridley's character was played well\\, manic changes in disposition and intents can leave you feeling like you've experienced whip lash (I'm looking to you salt flat scenes). \\n\\nHow well this movie stands the test of time will be determined by how episode IX goes. If JJ doesn't tightly weave a storyline off of this one and replicates an already used story line (return of the jedi) the work Rian did to shift the universe storyline will have been useless. If something interesting can be done that directly ties into this movie then I can see the Last Jedi going down as one of the best star wars films to ever be made. Given how the Force Awakens was written I'm skeptical that JJ will be able to take Rian's vision to this conclusion\\, and so I'm weary of how well the last jedi will age in the franchise. Old male rights activists will never like it\\, but they are not the ones who will be re-watching this movie in 20-30 years. I hope JJ writes a script that can capture that depth that was presented and deliver a home run.","true":true}
