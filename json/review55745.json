Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall a nice experience; however it still holds some of my biggest issues with the new saga:\\n\\nWhat's the first order?\\nWhy is there a resistance if there was a fully fleshed republic and new political system?\\nWhy should I care if these guys succeed or not?\\nWhy should I fear the first order?\\n\\nI know most of them can be answered in the games\\, comics and additional material out there\\, but seeing the movie as it's own\\, I don't get the answers i'm looking for\\n\\n[Spoiler free]\\n\\nStar Wars The Last Jedi was a fun film and kept some of the really good aspects from the force awakens.  Tons of practical effects\\, creatures\\, puppets\\, set pieces...All that is great; however the plot left me wanting a bit more.  \\n\\nNot gonna lie\\, there were really cool moments where the entire theater was in awe and gasped at what happened\\, but for me by the start of the second half I wanted it to end\\, only to remind myself there were parts of the trailer we haven't seen\\, hence there was more left.\\n\\n[Spoilers (Scroll down to avoid them)]\\n\\nMy main issue with the plot is that it was BORING AF!!!\\n\\nWe have Rey at the island with Luke for about 2\/3 of the movie in with Luke and literally is the same dialogue every time they appear \\\"I will not train you\\\" \\\"tell me what happened with kylo\\\" \\\"the jedi must end\\\" Add to that the fact the Kylo and Rey being \\\"connected by the force and talking to each other\\\" having Rey constanly say \\\"There's good in him left\\\" (Return of the Jedi much?!)\\n\\nThe resistance is fleeing their base from the last movie and what it looks like the entire first order is chasing them (just 3 ships) and they're fleeing with almost no fuel because apparently they can be tracked through lightspeed\\n\\nFinn and a new character head out the ship looking for someone to break them into the enemy ship while a power struggle happens on the resistance's ship between Poe and the \\\"new\\\" leader of the resistance while Leia is incapacitated after an incident.\\n\\nThe movie drags for waaay too long on these threee plots and made me look at my watch multiple times during the movie (bad sign)\\n\\n[End of spoilers]\\n\\nMy biggest issues with the plot and pacing were a bit left behind with one or two really cool scenes and the fact of watching it alonside my local 501st in a packed theater at 12am.\\n\\nPerhaps Rogue One left such a high bar for me making me not enjoy it as much.  If you're to go see it\\, go with a packed theater and enjoy the reactions to these cool moments.  If you're gonna watch it when it comes out on Blu-Ray and DVD\\, I would just rent it.","true":true}
