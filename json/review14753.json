Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great.

The things that bothered me the most about TLJ were the out of place jokes and puns that will not withstand the test of time. Star Wars was funny because jokes like\\, \u201cI would rather kiss the Wookie\u201d made sense in a galaxy far far away...","true":true}
