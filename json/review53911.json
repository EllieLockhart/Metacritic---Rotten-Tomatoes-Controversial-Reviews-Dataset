Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"how could anyone like this movie ?  You would have to be a non Star Wars fan who has never scene another Star Wars movie. \\n\\nI would say this movie is a cross between Family Guy Star Wars and a badly Made 1950s sci movie. \\n\\n It made 0 sense. Leia flying through space without oxygen or protection like Superman has to be the dumbest scene ever in any film.\\n\\nLuke is a weak character who does things. That I still do not get .  He projects himself an dies because of it ? What ? \\n\\nForce Ghost can now interact with the solid world ?  Then why  didn't Yoda and Kenobi just team up and kill Palp and Vader ?\\n\\nThe mystery of Rey's parent solved they are a bunch of losers.  Why even create that mystery ?\\n\\nSnoke who ?  Just some dude that has 0 back story and is killed like the Jedi that went to arrest Palp with Windu. Instantly and without any resistance. \\n\\nThis makes the prequels look genius and great story lines. \\n\\nTerrible Terrible Terrible \\n\\nI guess they were trying to make this movie a comedy because every scene was some stupid joke.  \\n\\nThe rest of the scenes and storylines were just as bad.","true":true}
