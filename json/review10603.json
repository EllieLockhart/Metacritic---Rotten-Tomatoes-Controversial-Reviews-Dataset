Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Grew up on star wars and have always been a fan. I have read the expanded universe and even the new updated one given to us by Disney. This story did not fit in with that universe. \\nSome of the best scenes ever featured in a star wars film were featured in The Last Jedi\\, but these scenes just did not make up for the very weak story writing.\\nAll in all\\, it was fun\\, but probably my least favourite of the franchise.","true":true}
