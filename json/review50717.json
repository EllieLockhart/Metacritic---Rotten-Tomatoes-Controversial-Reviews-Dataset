Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A 152 minute SNL skit about Star Wars. Poorly directed\\, poorly written and unbelievably poorly acted. For example\\, felt like I was watching Mark Hamill goof it up\\, instead of Luke Skywalker. Some good ideas are ruined by bad jokes\\, bad execution and tonal inconsistencies.","true":true}
