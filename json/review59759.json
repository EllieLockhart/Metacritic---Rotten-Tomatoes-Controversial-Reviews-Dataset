The first game was all about learning to trust and gaining hope in a world that seemingly forgot what hope is. In the first game all the main characters\\, despite being opposite\\, were both likeable and relatable. From the hurt and weary Joel\\, to the full of hope Ellie.\r\rHowever\\, the makers of this game have decided that their mission is to \u201csubvert expectations\u201d. This wasn\u2019t done subtly or intelligently\\, instead they seem to have gone to great pains to throw out everything good from the first game\\, and replaced it with some of the vilest characters ever\\, even if they wore the same name and faces. Honestly\\, Ellie would have made one of the biggest villains in any other game.\r\rAnd that\u2019s not the worst part. The worst part is the game is boring. It appears somebody at the game studio decided graphic violence would add shock value and be \u201cedgy\u201d. Unfortunately the makers decided that if a little shocking violence was good\\, then repeating it every couple minutes must be better? To the point that it fast became totally meaningless\\, and then extremely boring. Don\u2019t get me wrong\\, I don\u2019t mind violence in video games\\, I\u2019m also a big fan of the Doom series\\, but it is completely out of place here. In fact\\, thinking about it\\, Doom has a far better story than this dross.\r\rI\u2019ve heard the game studio was trying to make people think about the morality of hate and violence\\, but it failed on two counts. Firstly the player has very little agency in this game\\, you have to do the violent \/ cruel things\\, or the game won\u2019t let you progress\\, which separates the player from the consequence of the action. Secondly the game is so boring you could have hit me over the head with the message wrapped in a 2x4\\, but after the first hour I was so disengaged with the game I wouldn\u2019t have noticed.\r\rI forced myself to make it to the end of the game (and I mean forced)\\, in the hopes that it would get better. It never did.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
