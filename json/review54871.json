Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible half baked script writing incorporating a silly 'Mary Sue' main character and full of political agenda which had no place being in the film. \\nHonestly I am suspicious of the critics reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and the 'Tomatometer' score and that the real audience score is also well below 50% seeing how many half stars are being given.\\nI've been looking forward to the upcoming Han Solo film but after seeing this terrible mess I don't feel like there's any point\\, the franchise isn't safe in the hands of Kathleen Kennedy - if she wants to play politics then she should stand for election along with Rian Johnson!","true":true}
