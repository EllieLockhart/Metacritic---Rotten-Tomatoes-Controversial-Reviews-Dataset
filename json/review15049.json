Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left feeling disappointed and let down for all the hype. This was no Empire. It wasn't absolutely terrible. The new and old characters are all still interesting and I enjoyed the acting. The pacing though the whole movie seemed off. I'm also not a huge fan of the comidy approach. I don't mind it from time to time it just seemed like to much for Star Wars. It answered a few questions but not the ones I actually wanted to know. The lightsaber battles left me wanting.  Snoke was also a huge let down. If it were any other movie it probably would have gotten a higher rating from me\\, but I expect more from Star Wars. It all just felt empty at the end.","true":true}
