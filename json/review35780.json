Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is for Disney what Batman Forever is for Warner Bros.\\nBut Warner Bros didn't bribe or pay the critics\\, so their movie got 39% tomatometer.\\nBatman Forever's audience score\\, though\\, is 32%\\, and I am sure The Last Jedi's score will be significantly lower in a year or two.\\nLet's say 20%.","true":true}
