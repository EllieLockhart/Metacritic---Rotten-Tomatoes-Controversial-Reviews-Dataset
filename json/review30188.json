Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw it and I was pretty disappointed.  I really want to like all Star Wars movies. Rogue One was incredible! The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi were okay.  I wonder how long Disney thinks it can substitute nostalgia in place of  a strong story.  The Last Jedi was way too long.  The Last Jedi was a little boring.  Too many questions with subpar answers in this film. I feel that most legitimate Star Wars fans could have created a frame work for a more interesting trilogy.  I will still watch future installments.  I don't know if I would continue to consider myself a fan.","true":true}
