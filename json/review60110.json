The Last of Us Part 2 justifies why it is called \u201cpart 2\u201d instead of just \u201c2\u201d\\, since it is a direct sequel to the story of the first game. Each event of the previous one has consequences over the story\\, which truly makes the player think over about dilemas regarding the morality of the characters that reflects some other dilemas that we have in the real world. It is an experience that I have never seen in any other game\\, as unique as the first \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d was in its time. Indeed\\, it is a dark game\\, with a heavy atmosphere (way more than part 1)\\, that makes you have tons of contradictory emotions and experiences through your gameplay\\, which may be one of the reasons that some people don\u2019t enjoy it \u2014 but that contrast is exactly what makes it so special and beautiful. Only by playing it you will get to understand what I mean\\, but bear in mind you have to be ready for it. And for those who do not have the opportunity to play\\, you can also get a good view of it by watching a full gameplay walkthrough on YouTube (I repeat\\, it has to be an ENTIRE walkthrough\\, not just the main cutscenes to get to know the plot \u201cin general\u201d)\\, although some parts can be a little monotonous for those who are watching\\, like searching for resources (which again\\, contributes a lot to give the player a full experience both in part 1 and 2). In the end\\, Naughty Dog once again provide us with a true work of art\\, and despite you may or may not prefer the first game\\, it is inarguably great and worth playing.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
