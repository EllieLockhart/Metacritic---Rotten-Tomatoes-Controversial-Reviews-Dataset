Its still fine the way it is.\r\rIn my opinion the story is a really good one. It might appear cheesy and full of cliches but the storytwist later in the game was rather surprising - at least for me. The atmosphere in this game was intense and it wont let go once the chaos starts. Until Dawn was a terrifying experience and i enjoyed every minute of it. For my part i think the Game is better than expected\\, especially after some harsh reviews when it was shown on Gamescon 2014.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
