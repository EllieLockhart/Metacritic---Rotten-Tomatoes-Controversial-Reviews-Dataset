Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Best Star Wars movie yet. Rian Johnson's work as a director really turned out well\\, though the humor is kinda bad\\, I agree\\, but the story and cinematography is beautiful. It's so unexpected and unpredictable\\, you think something is gonna happen but then something else happens and it just blows your mind. Amazing movie!","true":true}
