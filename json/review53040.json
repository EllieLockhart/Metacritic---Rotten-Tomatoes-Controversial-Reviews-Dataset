Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a Star Wars fan\\, this movie was a letdown\\, to say the least. (FYI I loved Force Awakens\\, Rogue One\\, and the original trilogy). Despite great visual effects and action scenes\\, The Last Jedi was dragged down due to its bad writing that was poorly constructed and contained the most meaningless 30-minute subplot I've seen in a while (W\/ Finn and Rose). Not to mention the ending also felt rushed and bitter. The characters I loved in Force Awakens (Finn\\, Rey\\, Poe\\, Leia\\, Luke and etc.) were overall dreadfully handled and did not go through any sort of character development. And the new characters in Last Jedi were just bad (looking at you Rose and Commander 'Purple Hair Lady'). The only thing the director\\, Rian Johnson\\, accomplished was dividing fans apart and disrespecting beloved characters. The audience scores say it all. Disney doesn't care because they're making money and that's a shame.This movie and franchise deserve better. Mark Hamill Deserves better!\\n\\n\\\"I at one point had to say to Rian\\, 'I pretty much fundamentally disagree with every choice you've made for this character.\\\" -Mark Hamill\\n\\nOverall score: 4\/10","true":true}
