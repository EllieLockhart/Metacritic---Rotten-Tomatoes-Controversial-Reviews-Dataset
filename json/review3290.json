Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Been a loyal fan since I was in diapers. This movie made me feel like a chunk of my childhood had been destroyed. They made no attempt to appeal to their target audience\\, instead they killed as many characters as possible with zero back story. They preached feminism and debunked all fan theory. Great work\\, a billion dollar dumpster fire.","true":true}
