Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is so utterly horrible that it makes me mad just thinking about it. I still can't believe how they managed to ruin multiple of the most beloved characters while giving room to new poorly written ones that nobody cares about.","true":true}
