Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite some action sequences from the Rebels\\, and great visual effects\\, the story lacks on making characters interesting\\, poor story arcs from \\\"important characters\\\" like Snoke and Phasma\\, classy gags from luke and the unnecessary use of force from Leia\\, which adds nothing to the movie. Diminishes what could be a great story\\, but these easy to kill characters and poor story arcs from most of the cast doesn\u00b4t make justice to a Star Wars film. Sure it\u00b4s a most see film but don\u00b4t expect much from characters that got a lot of publicity only to be a total flaw on the film","true":true}
