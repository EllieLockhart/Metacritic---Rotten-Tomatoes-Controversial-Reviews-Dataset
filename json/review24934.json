Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My immediate reaction was indifference\\, which turned to hatred the more time that passed as I went over everything that I had seen. It is truly an awful movie and the biggest disappointment i can remember. It basically killed all hope. The only plus is I now think phantom menace is a masterpiece.","true":true}
