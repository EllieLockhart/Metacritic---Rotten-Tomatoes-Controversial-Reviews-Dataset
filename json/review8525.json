Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First\\, Disney may have ownership of Lucasfilm\\, but Lucasfilm still makes all of their own decisions so saying Disney ruined Star Wars is a load of crap. Second\\, just because the movie didn't have every little backstory that you wanted doesn't make it a bad movie. The lightsaber battles are spectacular. The plot twists are unexpected and rather fantastic actually. Yes\\, Rian Johnson put his own flare on the film\\, but that's his job! The acting was phenomenal. You can't be mad about them not playing out fan theories because that's all they are. Theories! This installment in the saga is incredible. If you haven't seen this film yet\\, it is absolutely worth it. Unless you like being a miserable stick in the mud\\, then I suggest you just stay home and theorize about how bad it is based on other people's opinions.","true":true}
