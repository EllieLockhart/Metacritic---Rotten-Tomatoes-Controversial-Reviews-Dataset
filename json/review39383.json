Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is more horrible then I could of ever imagined...I didn't care for TFA\\, but this takes it to a new level of bad. Leia superman? Bizarre to say the least and made me cringe like no other moment in cinema I've experienced. The plot is garbage and full of nonsensical moments. Why doesn't the First Order just send bombers to destroy the Resistance fleet? Force Ghosts can shoot lighting now? Pointless Casino subplot that leads nowhere\\, but to a poorly choreographed fight scene between Finn and Phasma. Luke seriously wants to stab children in his sleep? I could right a book about how this film insults my intelligence and the Star Wars saga.","true":true}
