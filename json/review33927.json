Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible; special effects were ok\\, but you expect a good story and you can't destroy the character of Luke Skywalker the way they did and expect fans to love it.  They better hope there are a lot of new Star Wars fans because I have been a Star Wars fan from the beginning and I doubt my kids or I will ever see a Star Wars movie again.","true":true}
