Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't believe that this is the WORST of all the Star Wars movies ever made.  Yeah\\, the action\\, the special effects and a lot of the acting are all outstanding\\, but what makes a movie great is it's story.  Unfortunately\\, I don't have as much free time as a lot of reviewers here to specify everything.  I'm sure many of the posters here had already touched on these but I really feel sad that Rian Johnson just ruined the most beloved movie franchise in history.  You are hearing this from me FIRST.  Episode IX's opening weekend will only get half of what this movie made.  The trust had been broken.  Long time fans will be approaching this movie just like they did Justice League ... extremely cautiously.  I personally lost all eagerness to see the next episode\\, hence won't be lining up on opening day.","true":true}
