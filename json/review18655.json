Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It pains me to say this as I never thought i would utter these words but I didn't like a Star Wars movie.\\n\\nThis felt like a chapter in a book that had nothing to do with the rest of the chapters.  This may have made a fine plot for his own trilogy but was totally out of context in the Skywalker story.\\n\\nI have never left a Star Wars movie in my feeling confused\/upset\/disappointed\/insert adj here.\\n\\nThis pains my heart as I literally live for star Wars movies.\\n\\nI'm sure Rian Johnson tried to make a good movie but as we all know: Do or Do not\\, there is no try.\\n\\nRian: You did not! :(","true":true}
