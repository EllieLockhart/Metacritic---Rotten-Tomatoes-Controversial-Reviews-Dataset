Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A Star Wars Movie that subverts expectation and leaves you wonder how are the rebels going to fight back. However\\, this does not mean it is a perfect film. After watching multiple times I could not help but notice some of the flaws. Just about everyone agrees that the casino parts feel out of place. A slow speed chase in space. I hope Luke's force ghost will be in the next film and can have a larger impact possibly teach Rey something meaningful like Yoda did for him in Empire. I can't hate the film the same way others have that is why I have given it a 70%.","true":true}
