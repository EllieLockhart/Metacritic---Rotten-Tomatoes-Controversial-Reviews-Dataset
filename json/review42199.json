Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie SHOULD have been good coming off of The Force Awakens. But it wasn't. The majority of the cast was relegated to pointless plot killing antics that did nothing but make me hate them while in the main story\\, the one that should have been focused on\\, some homeless man dressed up as Mark Hamill ruined the legacy of Luke Skywalker\\, one of the greatest science fiction icons of all time. At least the effects looked good despite apparently nobody near this movie even remotely understanding how physics works. It is more like a sequel to Spaceballs than a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
