Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only good part was the interaction between Kylo and Rey. The rebellion plot and Finn's adventure was stupid and pointless. Finn was underutilized Leia's force sequence was weird Rose's acting was terrible No amazing lightsaber duels No mysticism or curiosities to intrigue about the force and what it is.. Porgs were cute but an needless throw in to sell toys Snoke ended up being a wimp And Luke's whole story arc a complete let down I'm not even a hard core fan. Just seen the movies and enjoyed em. And yet I get the need to send this in. After Rogue One\\, which was great\\, I thought they'd get it right Boy was I wrong","true":true}
