Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really think I didn't want to hate it since it was a new and exciting Star Wars movie\\, however the more I think about it the more I really hate this movie.  It is not just the choices they made with some of the characters as I understand to give them freedoms but when you take long time favorites and change them entirely to what they would do is beyond forgiveness.   Luke's Story line made no sense as to why he would do that from what we know.  Superman Princess leia?  Really we have never seen her use the force and when we finally do she is a Master Jedi\\, not to mention how didnt every one else get sucked out to space when they let her back in.   I didn't feel like the story has gone anywhere and has basically told us that it is a War that will never end.  Some scenes seemed to be added since they were visually appealing however nothing happens or is gained from them so why even have them.  the Multiple Reys scene we should have learned there who her parents are or at least gotten a glimpse.  Isn't this the scene from Empire where Luke goes in the cave to face his fear.  Also I am used to seeing a grand climatic finally where we have multiple battles happening at once.  Lightsabers\\, spaceships and Lazers all at once really all we got was um yeah more visuals.  Overall I have to say that I hated it and as much as I was looking forward to seeing it again I probably won't  at least in theaters.","true":true}
