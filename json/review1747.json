Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a Star Wars fan I enjoyed it... It's not as good as the Originals or Rogue One but I'd still go as far as to say its better than Episode One and Two.\\nSome moments were a little puzzling but there's still another movie left in the series that may make some moments in this movie make more sense.\\nI do like the development of the newer characters but wish some of the older ones had more of an impact on the story. Still very enjoyable with some nice Star Wars moments. If you liked The Force Awakens you'll love this.","true":true}
