Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A \\\"ballsy\\\" move from writer and director Rian Johnson to expand the meaning and the universe of Star Wars like that\\, so we need to give him credit for that. However\\, this defiance is costly in terms of plot twists\\, making me uncomfortable as a fan. Great acting though\\, some of the finest in the entire series.","true":true}
