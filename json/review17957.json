Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think it's one of the worst star wars movie out there\\, if I was to be honest. I mean I am hardcore fan. Like\\, it was completely boring and a lot of decisions in the movie didn't make sense. But if I wasn't a hardcore fan with no knowledge of the force or any understanding of the Star Wars. I guess it was be a good movie. I didn't say great movie or must see or instance classic. It was just a good movie.","true":true}
