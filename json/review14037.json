Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you like special effects and don't care about a cohesive story or sub plots that make sense then you will love this movie.\\nLeave you rational thinking and logic at the door\\, because this movie will insult both of them.\\nThe only interesting things about this movie that could have made it great\\, were abandoned and replaced with pointless subplots and characters that no one cares about.\\nExtremely disappointed\\, worst Star Wars film by far!","true":true}
