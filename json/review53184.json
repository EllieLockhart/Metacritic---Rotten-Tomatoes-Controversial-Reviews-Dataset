{"101487":108557,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-22","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Been a Star Wars fanatic for 40 years. what they did to the story lines\\, characters and dialogue in this movie is utterly unforgivable. So much so that I create a Rotten Tomatoes account just to voice my heartbreak. \\n\\nI was not one of the people saying Force Awakes was \\\"amazing\\\". It definitely was too much of a carbon copy to Episode IV and at times felt forced\\, yet we DID care about the characters\\, believed their motivations\\, and overall the film \\\"felt like Star Wars\\\". \\n\\nThe Last Jedi pretty much destroyed all reason for why we should care about the finale in this trilogy. I don't care about any of the characters any longer\\, their story lines are farcical\\, the overall presentation no longer feels anything like Star Wars\\,  and I can honestly say this is the worst film of all the Star Wars movies. In two movies it has now killed all we loved about the originals as far as characters go\\, and what is left is simply an utter slop\/cheesiness fest. \\n\\nI blame it mainly on the writing\\, and also on Disney. It's very clear they're catering to a brand new demographic of fan base\\, uncaring of what the many millions of original fans have carried with them all these years\\, but all of that said...I'm still beyond amazed that this was the script they settled on. All that money to play with\\, and this is what you felt would deliver? WOW. Some of the laziest\\, un-inventive writing I've seen in any blockbuster as of late. From the unforgiving handling of classic characters\\, to new characters and createures and locations and story lines that simply fall flat on their face\\, to pathetic attempts at humor...it all was a colossal mess. The major scene at the end is rather fitting\\, for in reality...this entire film felt like a filtered hologram of what Star Wars once was. \\n\\nThe ONLY positive of this movie was the performance of Mark Hamill\\, but he sure deserved more to work with. Tragic how Luke was handled. Half way through the movie when the realization set in that this movie was going to be an utter failure\\, I grew depressed and it was pretty hard to focus on anything after that. Now im not sad...just angry. These movies really meant a lot to millions of movie fans all over the world...and this will be impossible to wipe out of our memories\\, very much like Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls. Same exact situation here. \\n\\nNo interest in going to the theater to see episode 9 now\\, and I'm not even sure I'll watch it in the comfort of my own home. Don't want to break anything or subject my wife and kid to such behavior. \\n\\nThis should have been a layup for you guys....and you tripped over your own feet and didn't even get a shot up.","true":true}
