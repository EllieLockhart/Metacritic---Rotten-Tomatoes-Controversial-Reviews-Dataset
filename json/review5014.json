Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Crap direction to take the story\\, pointless deaths of integral characters. The rest of the characters are weak with little or no back story including the main heroine and the \\\"infamous\\\" snoke. Total crud unless pure CGI is what gets you going. Story\\, characters and the lack now of any light vs dark balance ruins the whole franchise. I will be pretending anything other than 4\\,5&6 do not exist fir the rest of my life.","true":true}
