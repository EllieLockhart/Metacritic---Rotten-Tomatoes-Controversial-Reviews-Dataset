Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From what I've in excerpts and reviews of this movie. I refuse to accept it as an official Star Wars movie. It's insulting to it's audience\\, disrespectful to the series lore and it's characters and it simply doesn't add up as a story. Big shame.","true":true}
