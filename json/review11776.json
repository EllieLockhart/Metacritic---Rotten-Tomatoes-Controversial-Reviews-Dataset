Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"However long it might be\\, it is a great installment in the Star Wars franchise\\, bringing back memories of Empire Strikes Back. The Canto Bight scene felt a little out of place\\, but fit in well at the end.","true":true}
