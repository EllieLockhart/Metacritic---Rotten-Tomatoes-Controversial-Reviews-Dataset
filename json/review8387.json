Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Felt very sad having seen TLJ. I didn't expect the surprise i have been teased about would make me mourning the loss of SW. The scenario is not even good\\, its an accumulation of sorry and poor twists (which by the way destroy all the tracks introduced in 7.)","true":true}
