Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie EVER \\nOnly reason I didn't gave it 2 stars and not 1\/2 is because of a certain character coming back who's name I cannot say because it would spoil a bit of the movie \\n\\nI mean seriously?! I've waited two years to learn more about snoke and who Rey's parents were\\, instead u got nothing and was let down...I'm still gonna watch Episode IX but it better be good.","true":true}
