Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm utterly disappointed and angered with this movie. The original Star Wars was made my birth year\\, but I still remember seeing \\\"Return of the Jedi\\\" in the theater with my dad\\, and then taping each episode off TV when they came on. In college\\, I went to midnight showings when the originals came back into the theaters in the late 90's and then I waited in line overnight when the prequels came out. I am not a robot crashing this site. I have never given a review before\\, but I'm so angry at what Rian Johnson did to Star Wars I created a profile here to express my extreme anger and sorrow over what he and Disney has done to our beloved Star Wars characters and it's story line. I despise this movie and I'm furious with  them for destroying not only the integrity of the original characters\\, but the set up and potential storyline  that was made for the current characters. From the moment Luke threw his light saber over his shoulder the irreverent nature for the story line was made known and the movie went down hill from there. Lea super-manning to the ship\\, 40 minutes of the movie wasted for a pointless trip to a casino planet\\, Luke milking an alien\\, and then dying for no flipping reason! Come on! These are a few of the horrible choices\\, along with a terrible script and awful plot line\\, of why I will not see this again in the theater and will likely not even add it to my personal collection of every other episode when it comes out on DVD\/digital. For me\\, Stars Wars died with this episode. Just so sad. I can only hope JJ Abrams can somehow do something to rescue it from this mess\\, but I don't think that's possible. Just. So. ANGRY!","true":true}
