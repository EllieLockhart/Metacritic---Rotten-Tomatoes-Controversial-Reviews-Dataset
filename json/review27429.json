Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Outstanding plot. Tremendous surprises. Force Awakens took a regurgitated plot and made it magical with great direction\\, acting and chemistry. Last Jedi had fantastic plot but lacked the same chemistry. Still a great Start Wars movie!","true":true}
