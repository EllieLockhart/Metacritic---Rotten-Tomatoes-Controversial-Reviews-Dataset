Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A total departure from the franchise.  The new writers have intentionally ruined the original characters.  They then shoe-horned in characters that don't fit. They ignored most of the questions they created in Force Awakens and went down the liberal SJW rabbit hole with tones of political overtones. If you like Star Wars\\, you'll hate this!","true":true}
