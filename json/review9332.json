Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"General story not very compelling.\\nNo strong villan. \\nComedy destroyed characters and mood of the movie and made the villans look stupid.\\nSub-plots that lead nowhere and added nothing to the movie.\\nDisney product placement.","true":true}
