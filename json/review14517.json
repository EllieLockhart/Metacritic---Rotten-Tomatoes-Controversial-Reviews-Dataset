Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hate the way the movies destroys Luke and the story is boring.Rey is perfect in everything but I don't know what her motivation for her actions are. Which JJ could reshoot it.","true":true}
