Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was amazing!! Good sequel of STAR WARS.\\nI was excited when the Falcon goes into CRAIT's crystal core with the fighter attack song everyone likes.\\n\\n \\n\\nI think some parts are less organized cuts.\\n\\nBut I like it so much as Rian Johnson's STAR WARS.\\n\\nI need to see his past works and it may change my view of his movie.","true":true}
