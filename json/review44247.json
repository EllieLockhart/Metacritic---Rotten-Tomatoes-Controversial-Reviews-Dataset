Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Took the good feelings and momentum from Force Awakens and dove it into the ground. Had too many \\\"prequel\\\" feelings. Too much CGI\\, and weird goofy moments that didn't need to happen. Some of the best action and fight scenes ever created\\, but it made me not care about characters that VII made me care about and get excited about. Yikes.","true":true}
