Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"look not horrible\\, but not great. I still think the force awakens was a benchmark of new starwars gen movies and was brilliantly done with just the right amount of everything. I don't get it though with movies that they always try to go bigger and better than the last\\, which just makes them worse and then drags down the sequels. and with a lot of films like starwars it dosent need that\\, it will do it on its own. pick up the pieces and do it justice in the finale.","true":true}
