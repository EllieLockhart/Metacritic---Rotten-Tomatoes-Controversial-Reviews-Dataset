Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nice job Disney\\, you ruined Star Wars.  So many plot holes.  The first order is stupid\\, why is the resistance so weak?  Why does Luke suck so bad?  Like he would kill Kylo\\, after going on a suicide mission to save his father\\, the second most evil man in the galaxy?  Could have been so many interesting things with Luke\\, and Snoke\\, and the first jedi temple\\, the unknown regions.  But they went with stupid and meaningless plot lines.","true":true}
