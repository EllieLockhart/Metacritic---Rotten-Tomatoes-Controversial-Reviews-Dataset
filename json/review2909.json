Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A whole lot of plot holes \\, underdeveloped characters and in the end just a mess of a movie \\, Luke's character was just destroyed \\, Snoke disappeared just like he appeared \\, out of the blue \\, Rey's parents were bunch of nobody's \\, and the knights of ren story line was just thrown into the garbage bin .","true":true}
