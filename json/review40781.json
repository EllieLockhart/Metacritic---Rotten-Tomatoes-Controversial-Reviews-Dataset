Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie actually hurt my feelings with their depiction of luke from believing in the second most evil person in the galaxy vader to being a would be child murderer  my rating as a one goes beyond that  things like rey being a mary sue which is weak character development also snoke was killd prematurely i gave it another half star thobecause the visuals of admiral hold was amazing her withholding information from po was unnecessary and resulted in the dumbest side quest there are too many reasons this movie was rotten to list here","true":true}
