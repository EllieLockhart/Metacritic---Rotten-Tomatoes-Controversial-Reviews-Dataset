Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never walked out of a Star Wars movie feeling so empty before\\, and I've seen them all. All the characters\\, new and old\\, were cardboard\\, boring\\, and worst of all\\, predictable\\, in spite of all the things they were saying to each other\\, all that terrible\\, hollow dialogue. Star Wars used to be meaningful. Now\\, it seems Disney has traded everything that the series was\\, for cheap twists and senseless action\\, catered to the lowest common denominator. I don't think I'll be returning for the next installment. Hugely disappointing.","true":true}
