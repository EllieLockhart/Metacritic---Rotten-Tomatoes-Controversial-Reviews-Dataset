Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is the beginning of the \\\"seen\\\" evolution of Star Wars. It's beautiful to see change and growth but still have the DNA of the originals\\, the foundation of the mythology and as it should - the mythology grows to something that is similar yet different. It's what Zen and Chi and Prana are about. Perfect movie and not because there's no flaws but because it has matured the story as it should. Loved it\\, not blindly\\, but because I can see it for what it is and will be. Thank you Rian Johnson and the cast and crew that brought this into existence!","true":true}
