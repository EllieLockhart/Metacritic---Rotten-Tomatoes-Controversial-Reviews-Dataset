Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Seriously disappointed. Although the acting was mostly good\\, so many other parts were well below expectations. I felt the storyline was sacrificed in order to shoehorn in useless characters\\,  simply there to ensure the movie is as PC as possible. I realise they tried to make something different. However\\, this was the wrong type of different. The greats of the past especially Luke (Mark Hamil) deserved a richer more true to the character storyline.","true":true}
