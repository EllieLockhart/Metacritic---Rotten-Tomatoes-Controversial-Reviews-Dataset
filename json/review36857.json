Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the movie was all around a catastrophe.  they destroyed Luke. the entire star wars saga was about the Skywalker family and if you were a nerd Luke i am you would know that the expanded universe\\, that Disney so hastily destroyed\\, showed that Lucas thought that the entire thing was about the Skywalker family and more specifically Luke.  it surprises me because there were so many stories\\,  so many awesome stories\\,  that Disney could have chosen from\\,  but they chose this?  they seemed to be going out of their way to make every leader a feminist\\,  emasculated Poe\\, created that terrible PETA activist actress with a bad haircut\\,  and destroyed admiral ackbar without even a passing mention.  it was almost as if they sat down together and said\\,  \\\"hey listen guys. I want to figure out how to screw this movie up as much as possible.\\\"\\n\\nhonestly\\, the only saving grace was the lightsaber battle and the last space battle.  that was it.  but that alone doesn't save a terrible movie.  and sadly it was.  how they treated Luke's character was a sham.  for 40 years he was a legend and they turned him into a pessimistic hermit and ruined a great opportunity","true":true}
