Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ugh\\, just no.  This movie was boring and had no real direction.  The whole Canto Bight casino planet arc should have been cut\\, as well as Rose.  I'd much rather see Finn pair up with Poe again that listen to her cheesy lines and hear her lecture on social injustices....blurg.\\n\\nRey is Mary Sue who with less training than my dog\\, seems to be a master Jedi.  Ben\/Ren seems conflicted but not like Anakin did.  He reminds me of my angsty teen neighbor.\\n\\nLeia brings herself back from the dead in a scene as tacky as Vader yelling \\\"NOOOOOOOOO\\\" in episode 3.  And Luke\\, poor Luke.
