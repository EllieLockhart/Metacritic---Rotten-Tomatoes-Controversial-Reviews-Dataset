Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a train wreck that insults the intelligence of its audience. Visually stunning\\, superficially clever\\, but profoundly tone deaf and philosophically hollow. Its \\\"themes\\\"\\, which astonishingly seem to impress some people\\, are so on the nose\\, and at the same time inconsistent\\, that it makes for a frustrating viewing experience\\, like reading a poorly argued high school paper. Not recommended.","true":true}
