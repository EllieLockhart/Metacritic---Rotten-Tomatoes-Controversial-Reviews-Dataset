Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"R.Johnson smashed everything apart what JJ set up for the new trilogy. They lied to Mark about Luke's future in the movies what is totally disgustiing in my opinion. This movei had so much potential but Johnson f**ed it up. They wrote too much plot holes\\, chose the completely wrong direction. Killed off all the caracters who they should not...and these are just a few things. If JJ Abrams will say NO to direct the last episode of this trilogy I would not be surprised at all.","true":true}
