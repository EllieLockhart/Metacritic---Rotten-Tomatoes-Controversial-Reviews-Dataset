Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film has some of the best\\, most intriguing and magnetic scenes in all of the Star Wars films. But as a whole\\, it may be the worst Star Wars film of them all. I cannot even list all the problems with this film. It was often tonally off\\, but more than that\\, it was just tonally all over the place. It took itself too seriously and not seriously enough at the same time. It was a bit like the Guardians of the Galaxy or The Avengers with its cheekiness\\, almost winking at the audience in places. And yet it also featured lots (LOTS) of characters talking about their feelings very dramatically\\, in largely unearned moments that did not draw out the audience's emotions or engage their imaginations. It seemed to want to negate The Force Awakens with every breath\\, and the result is that it feels very much like Disney is just wasting our time. The reboot opened questions that this movie either doesn't answer by throwing the intrigue surrounding them out the window (like who is Snoke)\\, or it does answer them\\, unceremoniously and without delivering on any of the intrigue that they initially created (like Rey's parentage or Kylo turning dark). I respect the desire to create something new\\, but this movie seems to subvert expectations just for the sake of it. It's clever in the abstract\\, and I'm sure it looked bold and even elegant on the page\\, but it fundamentally misses the heart of why Star Wars has had this enduring appeal for people for so long and instead turns it into a Disney attraction. It feels like it was crafted by a marketing team who fancied themselves to be artists. The characters' motivations were very unclear and it made it difficult to root for anyone except Kylo Ren\\, who was without a doubt the star of the show by a vast margin. And even if I could forgive them for what they did to Luke Skywalker (and I truly cannot)\\, Laura Dern was decisively offensive.","true":true}
