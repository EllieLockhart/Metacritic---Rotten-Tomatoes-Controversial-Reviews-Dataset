Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is hot garbage. If you like the original trilogy or even the prequels this is NOT for you. Not only is the comedy so out of place\\, there is clearly a lack of direction with this movie. Sure the actors do the best they can but sadly Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy have made this franchise unwatchable.\\n\\nNow it is up to JJ to fix this with the next installment and I don't know if he can. Everything he set up with the force awakens has been pushed aside. And if he tries to tie up those loose ends now it will feel forced because this move tried it's best to make sure you know it doesn't matter.\\n\\nAll I can say is that the future of Star Wars does not look bright. Not only is the storytelling really bland but the characters themselves are equally as bland. It's fairly obvious after watching this movie why their toys are having trouble flying off the shelves. My advise is to the studio is for them to get a better creative that can actually plan these movies in advance.","true":true}
