Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are so many comedy moments and the main antagonist turns out to be a pushover. There are also many predictable events and very few surprises. Our heroes always get out of tough situations to the point that it gets old. I can barely recognize the saga that I know and love dearly. Unfortunately we just cant get rid of Fin\\, many more WOHOOOs to come unfortunately","true":true}
