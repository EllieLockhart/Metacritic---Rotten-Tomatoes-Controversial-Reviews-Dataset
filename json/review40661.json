Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is what William Shatner (Captain Kirk from Star Trek) posted on 4chan about The Last Jedi.\\n\\n\\\"It's me Shatner. I just wanted to say hi\\, and tell you guys the last jedi indeed was bad. We have had this banter rivalry with Star Wars for ages\\, but this was the first time I saw Mark truly depressed about what they did with luke. \\nIf they took Kirk\\, made him a crying coward who sells out his best friends and dies for nothing at all\\, I suppose I would be mad too.\\\"\\n- William Shatner","true":true}
