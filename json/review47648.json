Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What were they thinking. This movie was a complete cash grap by Disney. Lazy writing with poor character development. This movie had a director right ? sad. I sense the dark side hand in this movie. ","true":true}
