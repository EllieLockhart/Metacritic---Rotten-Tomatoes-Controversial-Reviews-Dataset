Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Uhhhgghh.......what a disappointment. Ruin Johnson really did Shiit the bed when he came up with this polished turd of a sequel. Abhorrent story-telling glossed over with millions of dollars of shiny CGI & FX. \\nWHEN IS HOLLYWOOD GOING TO LEARN?  \\nSTORY IS PARAMOUNT.....WITHOUT A GOOD SCRIPT\\, A BILLION $$ IN SPECIAL EFFECTS WON'T SAVE YOUR FILM (!)\\n\\n(Can't wait to see what Jar Jar Abrams comes up with\\, from what I could gleam from the trailer & leaks\\, Disney might just have a Fan Apocalypse on it's hands come Christmas)","true":true}
