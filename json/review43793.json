Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the worst Star Wars yet. If you haven't seen a Star Wars movie\\, then it might be OK\\, but its a complete 360 compared to the previous saga.\\n\\nThe film has way to many plot holes and not enough back stories. They kill off the antagonist with potential and replace him with a wimp. There are too many important characters who end up dying\/disappearing without explanation. The comic relief is similar to jokes you would find in Toy Story. Finally\\, it seemed like they had an agenda to make this the most \\\"PC\\\" film ever. I'm surprised they didnt have a trans main character.","true":true}
