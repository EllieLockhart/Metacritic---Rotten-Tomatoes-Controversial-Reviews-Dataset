Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson has delivered what is now my favorite Star Wars film. The Last Jedi is a powerhouse of storytelling that subverts unnecessary tropes\\, ignores pointless fan-theories and gifts characters we love with the most necessary and powerful character development in the entire saga. The film is just as much a commentary on today's youth\\, society and government as it is a fantastic\\, fun-filled\\, action-packed and character driven story. Complete with one of the coolest lightsaber battles ever put to screen.  Despite a bit of prequel-esque familiarity in a scene or two\\, The Last Jedi has not only given us a beautiful addition to the Star Wars saga\\, but a beautiful film regardless of the franchise baggage. We'll be talking about this one for decades to come!","true":true}
