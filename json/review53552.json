Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"everything was said in the other reviews so this is just a shortcut of my opinion: i`m not a hater or a troll who just wants to destroy a movie. But this movie was just a bitter experience and i did not made up any fantheories about the characters\\, also i did not watch those super - hyped - disney trailers which force you to like their shit. so i did not have any expectations and went in the cinema on the premiere.. and it shocked the shit out of me. The scene with leia flying in space\\, the horrible jokes and the plot holes with no plot?? A lot of people say that they like the freshness this movie has.. i do not have anything against new ideas or twists.. but the \\\"new\\\" ideas were just boring\\, and did not respect the Star Wars Saga in any way..  There were things that i like though.. like the relationship between Rey and Kylo (the one between finn and jar jar rose is just horrible) .. but in the end this relationship was destroyed by the so well known good and evil story.. like kylo is the bad one and rey is the super over powered women.. ah and yeah do we get a homosexuell bb8 in episode 9 so the movie is completely political correct? i mean i have nothing against gendering .. but that`s just to much for a movie... a star wars movie. i think disney should stop now.. i mean i love rogue one but this and the force awakens just shocks me.","true":true}
