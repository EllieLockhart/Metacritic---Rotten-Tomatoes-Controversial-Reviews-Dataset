Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Short review withsome spoilers. For a movie that's been so divisive\\, I will say this\\, starting with its strengths: Rian Johnson made a visually stunning film. The questions his script raised were engaging and important. The possibility of the Jedi being corrupt and Luke sealing himself off from the galaxy are amazing and worthy of a film. \\nNow on to its weaknesses. Unfortunately\\, Johnson's script and follow-through of the important ideas it sets up\\, in the words of RLM\\, \\\"failed spectacularly at every level.\\\" Last Jedi should have been a great movie\\, but with its missteps and inconsistent\\, overlong script with excessive comedic misfires\\, instead caused the franchise to implode.\\n\\n","true":true}
