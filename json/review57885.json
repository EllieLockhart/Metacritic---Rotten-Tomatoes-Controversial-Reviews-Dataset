Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"We t to the cinema to watch this film and left feeling disjointed and crushed. Gave it  another try when it came out online. Switched it of after 15 minutes. Just a question? Have the writers\\, director and producers of this film ever seen an original Star Wars film? Have they read any of the book? Ok maybe something a tad easier\\, do you know that space is a vacuum? So in the opening scenes we have one fighter taking on battleships point defence by itself. Bullshit!\\nThen we have big cumbersome B-17 bombers that drop gravity fed bombs in space??????? Huh!  Yes the developers of the Y-wing that was specifically tasked to bomb large star ships that was later replaced by the B-wing. Fast get in and get out intact star fighters. But no! What we really need is big cumbersome\\, slow\\, sitting targets that even a drunk stormtrooper could hit on a bad day. And blows itself up when it drops its gravity fed bombs (in the vacuum of space) that it has to be over the top off when it bombs. Wouldn't that also work from the side or below? \u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2\\\" This is just the opening stupidity and it just goes down hill from there. Really one of the worst films ever made. Don't treat your audience like fools!","true":true}
