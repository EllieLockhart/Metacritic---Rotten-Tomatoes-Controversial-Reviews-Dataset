Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Going into see this movie I was so excited hoping to find out all the questions that the force awaken set up.  Wow was I disappointed.  This movie is pointless and destroys everything good about Star Wars.  I have no interest or need to see the next one because this movie gave disappointing answer to who Rey's parents were. Also didn't tell us who Snoke was real or where he came from before killing him\\, so why does anyone need to see episode IX.  The Last Jedi should be the perfect example why studios need to no star a trilogy without having everything planed out before they start. \\nThanks Disney.","true":true}
