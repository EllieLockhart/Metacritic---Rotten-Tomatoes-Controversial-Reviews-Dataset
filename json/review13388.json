Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed the fun ride this movie brings. It reminds me of the wonderment and imagination the first time I saw Star Wars in 1978. This is still the one movie I wait for in anticipation. It does not disappoint. I enjoyed the humor in the move as in the past. I would like to see more of R2 D2 and C3PO\\, and more Chewy. Luke is still a complaining character and reminds me of the old character. Good job Disney! Not giving a 5 star due to not attaching to villian as I did with Darth Vader. I really want too\\, but can't. Removing the helmet did not help. ","true":true}
