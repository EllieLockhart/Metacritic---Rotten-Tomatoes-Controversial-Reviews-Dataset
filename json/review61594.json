Received so much hate when it got leaked and I've got a lot of doubt about it but I went through. Last of us part II is one of best games I've had on my ps4\\, naughty dog breaks so much limits upon what a game can be\\, totally take a huge turn from the first game\\, in terms of beautiful high quality graphics\\, much more calculated and gore gameplay that keeps the spirit of the first game. A heavy\\, tragic\\, ambitious\\, detailed and much more complex story that shows off different perspectives and deeper reflection and realizations of the situations the characters are taking in and showing how flawed and human they can be with acting from what they are and what they will be in the world of an unforgiving and cruel setting. It is such a roller coaster ride of emotions with shocking moments that the game will make you try to invest in its characters. The story shows up the actions turning into huge consequences affecting everyone by the means of revenge\\, violence\\, love and hate makes the characters interesting for how human and real they are. There are no forced SJW or LGBTQ+ elements shoved through you it is just what it is and there are no trans characters in the game just to clarify. This is one of the boldest move that the franchise had given showing a different path than the air tight story of Joel and Ellie from each other but it still has the creativity of making a very outstanding game than other repititive elements you see from other games. Such a level up tostory driven game in this generation.Well please don't listen to some retarted close-minded person I've played the game its great. Most of them are **** review bombing it without even playing it and others giving it 10 rating with **** post intentions just experience the game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
