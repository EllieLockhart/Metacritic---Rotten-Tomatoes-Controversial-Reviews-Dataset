Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left the movie feeling a sense of disappointment and being unfulfilled.  I felt this movie was a large departure from the original series.  The humor was at times funny\\, but many other times forced and a distraction.  This is a space drama\\, not Guardians of the Galaxy.  The characters lacked depth and often times came across a whining instead of strong.  Death of important characters lacked power.  The story lacked depth.  How can the Resistance constantly make the same mistakes over and over without learning a lesson.  How can you make Luke Skywalker such a pathetic human being.  There were some very strong visual moments\\, some great battles\\, but also unnecessary scenes that did not add to the story over 2.5 hours.  The movie was a disappointment from beginning to end.","true":true}
