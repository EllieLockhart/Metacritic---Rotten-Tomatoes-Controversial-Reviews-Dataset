Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I felt this movie completely disrespected the original Star Wars characters and story. Luke was a completely different character in this movie and did things his original character would have never done in the original Star Wars trilogy. I thought the new story was terrible\\, and I noticed many plot holes. I also noticed an anti-male undertone in the movie. I am a lifelong fan of George Lucas' Star Wars\\, but I am not a fan of disney's new Star Wars. I have no interest in seeing Episode 9.","true":true}
