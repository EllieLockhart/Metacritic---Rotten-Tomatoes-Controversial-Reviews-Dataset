The story feels like the first draft of a college english paper that was composed of several high school english papers on the same subject. It lacks an iota of consideration for consistency of character or narrative development. This series is a narrative focused single player experience\\, and  will be judged critically on that story.  Years from now\\, the only reason I will even remember this game exists is because of how disappointed I am in the game and the studio. The characters are inconsistent\\, underdeveloped\\, and do not act like sane human beings. You have a single thread throughout the story of how \\\"an eye for an eye makes the world blind\\\" but you never feel satisfied by the plot developments or the ridiculous need to pile plot threads that never build to a single satisfying conclusion.  I bought the game to know exactly why there was so much hate for the game. Now that I am done I hope  Naughty Dog recognizes that this is the worst game they have ever put out\\, and it should serve as a badge of shame.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
