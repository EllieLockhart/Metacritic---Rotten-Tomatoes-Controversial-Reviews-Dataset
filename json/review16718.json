{"101487":138016,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-06-27","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I never was much of looking at movies reviews\\, never commented on imdb or rotten tomatoes before\\, but with this movie\\, I have to confess I never felt so bad after watching a movie at the theater\\, it's hard to describe\\, I left the theater in December feeling insulted. I have seen lots of bad movies\\, but non of them made me having this kind of bad feeling as TLJ did. Watching this reviews and viewing people's comments feel kind a relief to see that I'm not the one feeling the same thing\\, as many movies reviews gave a lot of stars to TLJ and Rian Johnson even got his own trilogy to make (I was total\\\" WTF?! \\\"when I saw the news).\\n I'm not a super hardcore SW fan\\, but I love it's Universe lore\\, always enjoyed the movies since I was a kid\\, I also enjoyed the prequels (which fans seems didn't like it much)\\, loved Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels. The storytelling was always great\\, it made me want to know more about each character\\, about the force\\, it was a very believable universe. \\nNow comes to TFA and TLJ\\, TFA was kind \\\"ok\\\" as a movie\\, was good entertainment\\, but was a kind of movie made only to make money through the nostalgia of the franchise\\, as it haven't added anything new to the SW universe. Rebels were still Rebels\\, Empire is still the same thing with just another name\\, storm troopers and everything else are the same\\, as if people got old but time stoped on the galaxy\\, the OT events never happened. In an Universe so well made by George Lucas with potential to make so many great stories\\, was kind boring just to watch the same \\\"Rebels\\, vs Empire\/Death Star)\\, as nothing has changed since TROJ.\\nOn TLJ\\, was liking watching Spaceballs\\, just a bunch of morons fighting against another bunch of morons. No character development at all\\, just garbage and more garbage trowed at the audience. So many \\\"gotcha\\\" scenes\\, that really makes you feel insulted all the time while watching the movie. And it's a Star Wars movie\\, not Star Wars parody! The jokes didn't fit on the movie\\, they were stupid\\, stop copying Marvel's movie\\, Star Wars is not Marvel!\\n\\nThe Last Jedi is really bad story telling\\, bad writting\\, bad direction. TLJ ended in a so big mess\\, but like in a \\\"solved\\\" mess\\, The rebels now are just a few morons left\\, the new order has no real leader anymore\\, only morons left\\, so everything is a real mess but it didn't left anything open to make the people who is watching to get curious about what is going to happen on Episode 9. For me\\, the movie ended at the boy with the broom (hell.. a star wars ending with a commercial about star wars\\, what great ending..)\\, there is nothing left to make me excited to wait 2 years to watch Episode 9. When TFA ended\\, I was super curious about many characters\\, I was crazy to see the encounter of Rey and Luke\\, but now\\, are they dead or just fleeing on space.  \\nSeems Disney just wanted to play a game with the franchise\\, where someone begins a story\\, pass the flag to another to continue the story\\, and see how it changes\\, with no goal. How they can create an epic story where the directors aren't in the same page and they don't even know how it's going to end?\\nHow Disney can spend 4 billions in a franchise and have no plan for it at all? \\nJust hire amatour directors like Rian Johnson\\, make random stupid stories and see if sells. And in specially\\, how Disney can let their employees say that the problem are the fans? Telling that the fans and people who didn't like the movie are sexist\\, racist and all this political words. Fans are the ones who made the franchise worth 4 billions\\, are the people spending money on it. How a company like Disney can treat their customers like it?\\nI won't see Solo on the theather and I will deftinly won't pay to see another Star Wars movies after it. Please\\, fire Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson\\, no more SJW agenda on the movie\\, no more amatour writting and direction\\, bring someone who understands what Star Wars is and has real leadership to take place on Lucasfilm.","true":true}
