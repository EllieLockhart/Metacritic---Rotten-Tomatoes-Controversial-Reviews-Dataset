Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"40% rating from me.  Brings too many real world issues into a fantasy world which I just wanted to escape to... and enjoy.  Also heaped with social conditioning and seemingly left wing narrative script writing\\, to force upon those watching.  Why has that become a necessity in a Star Wars movie?\\nI loved The Force Awakens\\, Rogue one was also decent enough but started heading in a certain direction\\, whilst this movie has gone full swing to the left\\, its so obvious and blatant.  I just don't feel the Star Wars universe required real world beliefs\\, issues or agendas to be written in.  The characters were likable in The Force Awakens\\, but become less likable and perhaps even less relevant (Finn) in The Last Jedi.  Rey didn't need much training either\\, to become literally the most powerful being in the universe\\, defeating Kylo Ren twice over 2 movies and the most powerful being with complete ease\\, Snoke (Did I miss a scene or did she also just appear on the planet after the Snoke and Ren battle?).  Why did she even bother to seek out Luke\\, when she had such power??\\nMany other areas of the script and movie I had an issue with\\, Leia for example\\, being sucked into space and then seemingly discovering her Force powers by chance to survive.  The crew were able to avoid being sucked out when the ship door was opened to let her back in - She wouldn't have been out there in the first place if the vacuum of space wasn't an issue in the first place.  I could go on and on\\, the carpet bombs with gravity in space another example\\, the way Luke died another\\, etc etc.\\nQuite a few scenes I thought detracted from the real Star Wars universe\\, the points they were trying to push and how they were worded and acted out.  A real shame\\, as I'm going to be far less likely to bother with the next instalment\\, certainly wont be spending the \u00a3\u00a3's it cost to watch at an IMAX.\\nI give it 2 out of 5 and that is largely due to some spectacular effects and decent battles\\, but the rest of it\\, wasn't for me as a big Star Wars fan.","true":true}
