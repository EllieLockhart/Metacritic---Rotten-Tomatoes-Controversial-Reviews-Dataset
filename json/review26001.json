Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not just a bad Star Wars movie\\, but literally maybe the worst movie in history. Absolutely horrible. This is the only Stars Wars movie I haven't watched more than once\\, the others I've watched hundreds of times. I'll probably never spend money on a new Star Wars movie again after this garbage","true":true}
