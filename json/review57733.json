Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very clearly better than the prequels\\, but very clearly lagging behind Force Awakens and the original trilogy\\, this Star Wars film is in a tier of its own in terms of quality. It delivers strongly on much of what\u0092s made the franchise popular\\, but is not without its issues. As a popcorn flick\\, there are quality action scenes\\, yes\\, but we\u0092re forced to wait a long time for them. But while Force Awakens did a spectacular job of keeping us invested in the stories of Rey and Finn by giving them clear\\, personal stakes\\, Last Jedi suffers from centering on a plot that feels too big for audiences to relate to. Everything is tied to The Resistance\\, a group of 200 people we really have no reason to care about. Yes\\, Rey and Finn are part of the Resistance but we\u0092re never really given reasons for why it matters to them. As a result the fate of the Resistance hardly even feels connected to the fate of our heroes. All in all\\, though\\, it\u0092s still got a handful of entertaining moments that ultimately redeem it and make it worth your while. Worth going to see\\, but don\u0092t set the bar too high for this one.","true":true}
