Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This Star Wars movie was the laziest in the entire franchise! There wasn't enough time to develop any of the characters further\\, or to build up new ones. Rose's personality was rushed in too quickly which made her seem half hatched. I started liking Finn when he was about to sacrifice himself for the greater good of the resistance\\, but it was completely ruined by Rose confessing her love that didn't even have time to flourish in the two days that she knew the character. All in all that's how I walked away from the entire film. Phasma and Snoke were also a huge disappointment.","true":true}
