Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite throwing away all the build up and history\\, and being disrespectful with legendary characters\\, the movie didn't need to be so dumb\\, it tried to hard to be funny and cool looking\\, but didnt care about the history\\, writing\\, characters and overall state of the Star Wars universe. Episode VII did an amazing job introducing new characters and lore\\, and Episode VIII did a even better job killing then.\\n\\nDon't let Rian Johnson near a movie or a script ever again.","true":true}
