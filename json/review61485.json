Therefore anyone claiming one has to play the game to gain understanding of the \\\"story\\\" (use the term loosely) in part II is very ignorant. Gameplay does not affect the story in any way in part II\\, it's simply the vehicle through which the player travels through the story. Thus all the claims about gameplay are irrelevant...The Last Of Us was never praised for gameplay. it gained acclaim because of it's plot\\, which was creative in several aspects. The main four being how the cordyceps virus affected humans\\, the relationship between Joel\\, and Ellie\\, what Ellie meant for mankind\\, and the nuance of all these things blended together.\r\rYou get nothing like the above in Part II\\, there is a complete focus on violence\\, and despair. The game is quite dangerous in this aspect\\, as it's easy to see depression set in as a result. The Last Of us part II is a game depressed individuals should definitely not play. It is a game about \\\"revenge\\\"\\,  which are a dime a dozen. A cliche plot point\\, which is beyond overused at this point\\, and offers nothing to fans of the original game\\, when compared to it.\r\rObjectively\\, it is impossible to do a continuation of The Last Of Us...seeing as it's like the end of a book series. There is only room for a prequel (Ground zero for outbreak) or a middle sequence (Joel\\, Tess\\, Tommy\\, and Marlene lives up til the start of the original game) to the aforementioned \\\"book\\\" series analogy.  I rate the game a 2...1 point for graphics\\, and 1 for gameplay\\, any other numerical value solely resided with the story of the game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
