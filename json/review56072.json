{"101487":168268,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-05-11","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"so many problems are present\\, a person could go on for hours nitpicking but here are the biggies that kill the sequels and dishonor the orginals\\n\\nRemember Luke? well you won't find him here\\, the former paragon for all things good has been dragged into the mud. I remember as a child wondering why Luke was so driven to save a man he never knew despite the fact Vader killed Obi Wan\\, well the answer was he was once a great man and Obi Wan missed that friend dearly. He could have killed the man who killed his first master but he did what any paragon of the light would do and save him. \\n\\nBut now? he was willing to kill his nephew in his sleep\\, his own student for no other reason than because he was being \\\"seduced by Snoke\\\" whatever that means.\\nAnakin was a tragic and complex and interesting character because he was willing to embrace the dark side to save those who he loves even if it means sacrificing his childhood dream. but Kylo? he has no motivation other than power for powers sake.\\n\\nAlso Han was a dear friend to Luke and he and Chewie should have spent at least a scene mourning together. For those who are ignorant of this situation these sequels should have been a gold mine for Storytelling but Rian and Abrhams messed that up royaly\\, you see this was our opportunity to say goodby to some of our favorite characters one by one. Luke should have been present to see his friends death and that would have been far more interesting than watching his adopted daughter for a day be the main cast member in mourning\\n\\nSpeaking of which\\, is it odd that at the beginning of the movie she hates him for killing Han\\, which makes sense; to then have chemistry with this genocidal maniac for no other reason than a shirtless scene and they have been connected for a grand total of what? three days?\\n\\nAlso Snoke said in the last movie that Kylo killing his father wasn't enough\\, he still had training to complete\\, that training was killing a random nobody you have been connected to for three days.\\n\\nalso phasma has no reason for exising in these last two movies other tha to sell toys. she betrayed the first order in the last movie by lowering the shields to save her skin and in this movie by taking her sweet time with a public execution instead of frying them on the spot\\n\\nAlso the Holdo plot where she had a plan for the Resistance to escape all along was beyond dumb to the point it was necessary to justify her existence and provide reason for the casino arc to exist which is almost as dumb. Both accomplish nothing other than to educate the audience about bad communication in the worst way possible.\\n\\nAlso Rey is and OP Mary Sue still\\, remember how she experienced rain for the first time\\, well she can somehow swim. This girl has had no struggle in this movie that matters","true":true}
