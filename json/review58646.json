Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The only reason i played the game was to see joel alive  or see him die like a hero in the end of the game. AND what do i get a story about somone I didnt even know existed in the first place and the death of the best charecter in the series  in the most horrible and shameful way possible considring his 25 YEARS of experience through the apocalypse. So yeah i gave it a zreo cause somone who wanted  the game to look like GOT  by killing the best charecters or making  them brain dead and useless. So dont play the game if you liked the first one or cherished the relationship and dynamic between the characters cause it  goes down hill in the second. Forgot to metion i wanted a refund as soon as i knew about waht happend in the game through livestreams and YouTube videos  and i didnt get it  then i played the game for the SOLE purpose  of killing abby and didnt even get that. So to summarize this game sucks balls.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
