Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poorly written\\, unimaginative\\, sequel that drags on due to convoluted plot lines\\, recycled themes and one dimensional characters. The sins are infinite - from the flying Leia-Poppins  to the  the discarding of Snoke\\, from the improbable survival sequences to the breaking of the force rules - the film falls apart under its own weight. Half of the film\\, with Rose and Finn quest sequence\\,  is just senseless and unwatchable.  Ryan Johnson should  be relieved of all his future duties.  Mark Hamill is the only redeemable performance here. This should be the final Star Wars film. Disney should stop milking the scared cow and respect the audience more.","true":true}
