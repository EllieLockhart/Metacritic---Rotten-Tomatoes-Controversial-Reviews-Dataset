Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too fake. Too many run-ons.  Not enough action from Luke. Leia in space\\,\\,\\, wtf? She should of just died there.  Snoke died too easy and should have been killed by Luke. The pilot Poe Dameron was such a bad actor with stupid lines and way too sarcastic about everything including I Love you BB8.   The mission to rich island was a waste of time and saving the weird horses was the dumbest scene of the movie.  Luke never even explained the dark side to Rey or even warned her of the power of the dark-side.   BB8 was completely farfetched at least five times in the movie including how he some how got on top of the fighter.  Ridiculous and stupid.","true":true}
