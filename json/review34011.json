Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible to see such disrespect to Luke and Yoda.  This movie was made by people who hate star wars\\, so they work hard to deconstruct its pillars.  Yoda destroys ancient jedi texts\\, Luke contemplating murder of his wayward nephew then hiding on an island while same nephew wreaks havoc on the galaxy.  Rey doesn't need a teacher\\,  boys and girls\\,  you know better than your elders who are a bunch of cynical cranks drinking green beast milk while working out their self hatred.  Even Finn getting saved and chastised for his attempt at self sacrifice...what is the lesson here?   No greater love. ..  well that wisdom worked for the admiral lady\\, why not Finn?\\n\\nIt is also annoying that the entire movie keeps the rebels at the very edge of destruction.  There are times in a story for not everyone to need to be in a panic.   Seemed lazy story telling\\, and did not feel rivetting in the least.   I'll quit now.","true":true}
