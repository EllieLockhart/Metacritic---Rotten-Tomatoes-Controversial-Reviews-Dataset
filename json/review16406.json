Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm seeing a lot of close-minded \\\"fans\\\" dumping on a film that took some very interesting (and entertaining) steps in what I feel is the right direction for Star Wars. Visually stunning and emotionally arresting. I unfortunately had certain events in the film spoiled for me\\, but the movie still had me holding my breath. Honestly\\, this is a serious contender for my favorite Star Wars film of all time. Ignore the fools who are upset by the changes. They've spent too long writing their own fanon.","true":true}
