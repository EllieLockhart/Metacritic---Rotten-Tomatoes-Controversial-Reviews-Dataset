Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've wasted a lot of time following two plain characters in a subplot that leads nowhere.\\nReally\\, you can cut those scenes un the casino and it won't change a thing.\\nAnd that's only one of the issues with this \\\"movie\\\".","true":true}
