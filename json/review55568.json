Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a diehard fan but I grew up watching the movies.  It was apparent that Johnson\/Disney wanted to go in a different direction.  This change would've been fine if it was done more tactfully and with a better story line.  Instead everything just seemed so random.  The humor seemed forced and made the film play more like a parody. Laura Dern's character\\, was totally unnecessary.  Finn's and Rose's mission didn't really have a point. Their romance seemed come out of really no where.  Benicio Del Toro's character had potential but wasn't fully developed. Snoke didn't have any backstory and was unceremoniously killed off and replaced by bratty kid with Daddy issues. Also\\, Kylo is not really a true villain\\, sorry but when you off your Dad there's no having second thoughts.  He also didn't really put up much of fight against Rey despite her lack of training and seems not as powerful as Snoke. Luke is not really doing much and is just mopey till his send off in the end.  All in all there was no real homage paid to the old characters and no real development of the new ones to look forward to.","true":true}
