Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"absolutely shit movie! and i have  followed star wars all my life! I have close to every toy! dvd! poster! you nme it ive got it! and the last jedi can kiss my arse! I hope that SOLO is a good movie and gets us back on track! loved force awakens... new characters are awesome .... not rose! rey..... meeh she ok","true":true}
