Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was awful. Plain and simple. It's full of pointless plots\\, unfulfilled and abandoned character arcs and corny cringe worthy jokes. this movie is the EPITOME of soulless FILM-MAKING. but hey at least you can sell some shiny new toys.","true":true}
