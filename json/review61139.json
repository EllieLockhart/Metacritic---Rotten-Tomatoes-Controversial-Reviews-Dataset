Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Among the sea of bad reviews I hope that what I say will not offend anyone but instead shed some light on what seems to be a foreign POV. Yes\\, in the game our dream daddy of gaming was killed. Did we cry? I sure did\\, couldn't stop. I was fuelled by rage and anguish. I was Ellie. Through what was the first half of the game I felt everything she felt. And then Abby came into the equation. What leads up to the final battle is a step into Abby's shoes. At first\\, I was not on board\\, I want this **** to die\\, I wanted Ellie to beat her to a bloody pulp. That was until Abby's story started to pick up. As Abby I saved a young boy who defied his society. I conquered my fear of heights. I slayed the ugly **** that was the rat king. In what felt like minutes but really was hours\\, I was Ellie again. I was standing on a Misty beach staring at a starved Abby with my fists curled. What started as  burning hatred in hour 2 turned into me screaming 'stop' at my TV. I've been playing video games for a long time and not once have I not wanted to press square. I froze up twice during the final battle and this is something I've never experienced. The reason why I give this game a 10\/10 is because Naughty Dog made me feel something I've never felt. To call this game a lazily written revenge plot that doesn't end with revenge is undercutting the game's accomplishments. Whether you liked the game Naughty Dog did what they set out to do.  We all felt lost\\, angry\\, and confused. In my mind this game is a masterpiece for that very reason. It provoked thought and it sparked conversation. I highly suggest the game. Form your own opinion and share it. But please\\, I ask that any hate towards the developers or critics comes to an end. Thank you for reading my really long review\\, enjoy your scrolling\u2026 Expand","true":true}
