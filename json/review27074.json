Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the most complex and daring entries in the Saga\\, The Last Jedi to me will\\, eventually\\, be considered of the same-- if not higher\\, caliber as Empire Strikes Back after the storm dies down.\\n\\nThe crew took risks and brought the series to a place it has never been before.
