Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Game of Thrones-itis... If you\u2019re going to kill off major characters it has to have weight and meaning\\, the shock value is cheap. This movie felt like it should have been a spin off Star Wars story\\, not part of the main saga.","true":true}
