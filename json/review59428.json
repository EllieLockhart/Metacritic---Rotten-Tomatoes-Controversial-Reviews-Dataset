The narrative of the story is quite superior to most other games because it obsessive follows and symmetrical structure both in terms of narrative structure as well as characterization. This way of telling a story is quite uncommon in video games but often found in critically acclaimed literature and movies. TLOU2 is a bold step forward\\, pointing the gaming industry to move from purely catering to people's liking\\, and into a much more serious and artistic style.\r\rEven if it is hard for me to accept that my beloved characters are harmed\\, I can not deny this game is a very good game\\, and it should be marked as an important moment that video games evolved once again!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
