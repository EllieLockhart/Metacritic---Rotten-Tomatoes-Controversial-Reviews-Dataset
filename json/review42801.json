Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was mildly fun to watch like fast food is pleasant to eat\\, but oh the indigestation afterwards. As long as you just went with it and didnt THINK too much TLJ was tolerable\\, but remembering requires thinking\\, and that brings to mind the sheer awefulness of the script which\\, when it wasnt simply stupid\\, was insulting to anyone who loved the heroic and swashbuckling archetypes of the original trilogy. Only denial and copious amounts of hard alcohol can diminish the building fury I have toward this cinematic violation. It was simple grave robbing\\, and not to create some new life but rather a pathetic puppet show with a loved one's corpse. WORSE THAN THE PREQUELS!","true":true}
