Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a masterpiece. I loved The Force Awakens\\, but it was a bit of a nostalgiafest. It would have been so easy to make Rey a lost Skywalker child\\, but this story rejects all those tired tropes. \\n\\nSnoke could have been another Palpatine\\, but he's not. Instead his mystery is a fools errand when the story is about Ben Solo and Rey. Rey is challenged when her mentor is aloof hermit who no longer believes the Jedi are necessary. In the end Rey faces her fears and Luke overcomes his failure. Rian Johnson should be praised for this epic story. It's a real achievement.","true":true}
