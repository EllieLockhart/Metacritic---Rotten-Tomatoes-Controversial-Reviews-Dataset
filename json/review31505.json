Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sometimes I really hate star wars fans. Y'all complain far too much and put every film on an unrealistic heirarchy. This was an amazing film. A lot of things we done differently but it was still a star wars film and answered most of the questions we had from the force awakens. The only thing I wish is that they would have given Leia an ending. Idk if I wanna see a fully cgi Leia in episode 9.","true":true}
