Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointed\\, so many huge plot holes. Instead of characters playing out organic feeling actions and decisions\\, what we are given feels like a conciously created outline which plays out like checkmarks on a list: a rediculous feeling\\, plothole-filled list. Because of this the story feels lifeless\\, which is actually worst than the not-smart plot itself. I am a Starwars fan. I feel lied-to and sad.","true":true}
