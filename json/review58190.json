Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You can't just have Snoke and not give us anything on him. The Emperor was well done because he wasn't put in an established universe. Like\\, the difference between the two is the perceived beginning\\, or lack of one\\, in the original. The viewer has no preconceived knowledge about the Star Wars universe in the original films. It stands to reason that powerful characters exist\\, unknown to the viewer.\\n\\nIn the TFA\\, and new trilogy\\, the universe is established. The evil was the empire\\, Vader and the Emperor. For a character of Snokes power to exist\\, is odd. It requires an explanation. And for characters such as Luke and Leia to refer to him by name\\, on multiple occasions\\, and for others such as Rey to never question this\\, is disconcerting\\, unnatural and entirely immersion breaking.\\n\\nWe didn't need the prequels necessarily but we got Palpatine's development over 3 movies. Snoke on the other hand is deliberately set up as a \\\"mystery box\\\" by JJ\\, then disgarded by Rian. That's it. No keeping the mystery while developing him over the movies\\, no back story is given at all\\, just that he was around back in the day and look at all this shit he can do. The old trilogy kind of deserve an explanation\\, it ruins the suspension of disbelief when everything we knew at the end of 6\\, is disgarded....how did he learn about the force the emperor and everyone else is dead\\, how did he take over the empire remnants\\, how did he seduce Ben\\, all of these things asked and presented in the first movie not explained in the second. The original ones at least answered the questions they asked.","true":true}
