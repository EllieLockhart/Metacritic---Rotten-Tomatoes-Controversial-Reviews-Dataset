Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Oh no... Disney and rian johnson basically just moved their bowels on the star wars universe as enthusiasts know it. No. Just no. I was born in 1982 and fell in love with the story and the saga since the days of VHS. This wasn't star wars. It's \\\"Disney's star wars\\\" and it pays no homage to the force and it's white knight. Luke Skywalker. Hello! This is Darth Vaders son! Did you stop to consider that most fans appreciate the distinction between all the great Jedi Knights and what makes them unique? And to develop an antagonist and simply end him with no explanation as to who or how he came to be? Were the writers in 3rd grade??? Did anyone actually think\\, hmm lets consider star wars and its fictional universe and lets then try to maintain some type of continuity.... naaah. Lets just make up some random story \\, disregard the old one completely\\, and make up whatever we want\\, and run with it. after all\\, they'll still go see it. Its star wars right?  You stole star wars from us Rian\\, you stole it\\, and Disney... I expected more from you. Epic visual effects and fittingly funny. Mark Hamil was cheated out of what could have been a super addition to the star wars story.","true":true}
