Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had hope that this would make star wars great again\\, but the movie was awful. All problems to this movie was down to the writing. The actors did their best with the material they had\\, but everything they did made no sense.","true":true}
