{"101487":111724,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-28","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By far the worst Star Wars ever. Overall\\, it's not as original as people say. All the clich\u00e9s are still there\\, but dumbed down and deconstructed in favor of no alternative. Script is just a sequence of arbitrary\\, incoherent things. Consequently\\, action is boring and pretentious plot twists are ridiculous. Here's a thought on the characters development: (Spoiler alert)\\n\\nSnoke has no backstory. He's a generic evil overpowerful villain that looks like zombie Hugh Hefner\\, comes out of nowhere and dies randomly\\, even though he was overpowerful (for no reason).\\n\\nKnights of Ren are not even mentioned.\\n\\nKylo Ren's backstory is that he was made generically evil by Snoke. Doens't matter how or why. Then\\, an incoherent action by Luke makes him more evil. He beats Luke single-handedly with a fart-looking gust of wind. He's overpowerful for no reason.\\n\\nRey has no backstory. She look for Luke to get help but gets none. She gets no real training.  She has a mental connection with Kylo for no reason and for no reason has an emotional connection with him. Then\\, she gets tired of Luke and beats him to the ground. She's that overpowerful for no reason. (By the way\\, this is not a sexist remark: it'd be great to see a significant\\, wel constructed female protagonist in the movie. Too bad she's just a generic adolescent built for marketing purposes.)\\n\\nLuke is the worst Star Wars character ever made. He's completely incoherent with the original character\\, who ignored Obi-Wan and Yoda's counsl to kill Vader and instead followed his own guts and risked his life and the fate of the galaxy betting that Darth Vader could be redeemed. Episode 8 Luke spends the 30 years thereafter building an academy that's not showed in the movie full of people not mentioned. One day he shows up at Kylo's bed at night and for no reason concludes he'ss generically evil\\, and has a random impulse to kill him to prevent him from doing evilness. That ends up triggering Kylo's evil fart attack that destroys all the academy and kills everyone. Then\\, Luke spends the rest of his life whining with vaguely suicidal complaints\\, and keeps it up when Rey visits him asking for help. In the end\\, he decides to help the protagonists in a battle\\, and the movie pretends to portray him as a badass hero. The charicature is so wild that he appears taking a massive laser barrage from an entire army (why not a Death Star beam? The bigger the better\\, right?). Then\\, it's revealed that he was a mere magical  projection of himself. He actually did nothing but pretending he was there\\, but actually wasn't. Great metaphor for his character in the whole movie. \\n\\nThe only decently scripted characters are Finn and Poe. But they're secondary characters\\, and can't carry the whole script on their backs.\\n\\nBB-8 kills a platoon of stormtroopers. Looks like everyone is overpowerful for no reason in this movie.\\n\\nCaptain Phasma appears in a flashy way just to die in a pointless fight. By the way\\, all the action in the movie looks flashy and pointless.\\n\\nLeia is blown by photon torpedoes out to space\\, but uses magic powers she never seemed to have (and neither did anyone) to fly away through space back to a ship and survive. Crappiest moment of all Star Wars saga\\, including cartoons for small kids. (I keep saying \\\"magic powers\\\" because this doesn't resemble the Force at all Ironically\\, at a certain point the movie remarks that the Force is not a crazy superpower you have. But it is..)\\n\\nOld references of the anterior movies are constantly deconstructed and ridiculed. Specially the old protagonists must be made meaningless and killed\\, so the new generation can take their place. But the new characters are not even... anything. The whole movie is extremely disrespectful to Star Wars franchise\\,\\, and seems to mock the spectator constantly for ever liking it. By it's own merits\\, on the other hand\\, it is at most a generic commercial dumb adolescent movie ffull of clich\u00e9s\\, empty special effects and scenes custom-made to generate toys\\, games\\, ads and products. \\n\\nI love the original Star Was trilogy\\, and like more or less the other movies\\, books and comics\\, depending on the case. But this movie simply made me loose interest in any new Star Wars releases by Disney. \\n\\nR.I.P Star Wars","true":true}
