Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to love this movie but it was a flatout mess. It was painfully long\\, had plot threads that went nowhere\\, poor use of characters (old and new)\\, humor that did not make sense for old characters and a number of wtf moments\\, not the good kind. I'm cool with trying to expand and do something different with the Star Wars universe but for me\\, nothing paid off. There were also scenes and locations that felt way out of place. There was so much superfluous stuff and it seemed the director was more concerned showing off background creatures than developing characters in interesting ways.\\n\\nI felt every minute that passed and in the end\\, I felt like I wasted my time. I don't know how to say this other than\\, I hate this film.","true":true}
