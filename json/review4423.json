Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"CAUTION MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS...\\n\\nLast Jedi was a best of Star Wars retrospective masquerading as a new movie. \\n\\nNot everyone can or should be Han Solo snarky. Every line should not be cut down with a quip. \\n\\nEnough with the awful CG characters.\\n\\nEnough with \\\"Cantina\\\" scenes full of characters that don't do anything. We need more creatures that actually advance the story. \\n\\nIt's great to see familiar characters\\, but not when they either have nothing to do\\, become background fodder\\, or look like bad CG.\\n\\nThere were great moments\\, but they seemed to be bookended by genuinely awful ones. It was like whiplash. \\n\\nA one word description would be disappointing.","true":true}
