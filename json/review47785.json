Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Whereas there were some great cinematic moments within the movie\\, on the whole\\, it felt as though they were more interested in making a radically different movie within the Star Wars universe as opposed to making a good Star Wars movie.\\n\\nIt is interesting to note the massive disparity between Professional critics and the audience score. Now\\, there is bound to statistical bias to the audience score\\, I mean this IS Star Wars. We fans are\\, to put it mildly\\, passionate. but it is also important to note that such fan outrage should not be dismissed. We are the customer base.\\n\\nHonestly\\, this last bit is a bit of an emotional ramble\\, so feel free to disagree with this entirely. Moving past Rey's background reveal\\, Snoke's abrupt dismissal\\, Heavy-handed political injections (fuk the rich amirite? :P)\\, Story elements such as the blueballing mirror scene (You know which one I am talking about\\, god that was a waste of time and could have been removed without any change to the story and characters)\\, Magic superpower force mastery for literally no reason (Shit is hard\\, force-users train for decades to do accomplish some of those feats)\\, Magic space superwoman Leia (I literally burst out laughing at that absurd scene)\\, I could have done without them trying to kill my childhood heroes before they died. \\n\\nWe get so few of these in the real world. So many seem to die too early or live long enough to be revealed as monsters. For this reason\\, we turn to books\\, video games\\, and cinema to be larger than life. Something to look up to. I can't believe they tried to turn Luke into a child murder!? The guy who saw salvageable goodness within in Vader. Really? He was willing to forgive the man who tried to kill his mother (You could argue he succeeded too)\\, murdered hundreds if not thousands or innocent beings personally\\, Gave orders to murder millions\\, if not billions more\\, and ultimately destroyed the Jedi order by hunting them down starting with frightened children. This is the guy that saw some darkness in a child and was going to murder him in his sleep? Fuck you Rian\\, go make some art films if you want to be shocking. If this wasn't your choice and was Disney's\\, then I apologize for saying this and take it back and place it upon Disney's colossal ill-advised head.\\n\\nDon't replace an existing story line with an objectively weaker story line and try to pretend like it is something to celebrate.","true":true}
