Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not only is this the worst Star Wars movie to date\\, it is I think\\, the worst story ever told in the Star Wars universe. It drops the ball on just about every plot device it was given from TFA. Combine the latter with forced humor that's basically used to ruin any dramatic moments the audience might feel and you get a film that seems determined to rob the viewer of moments of genuine emotion. The politics in this film were so in your face that they could be called stereoscopic. I feel like I paid $20 so a bunch of people could explain to me know how awful I am for being a white male. Did I mention a complete lack of character development? I honestly wish they would have let Rian Johnson keep the writer-director position for Episode IX\\, only then would we see the true backlash of from fans that would refuse to see the film.  Save your money and rent it on Redbox.","true":true}
