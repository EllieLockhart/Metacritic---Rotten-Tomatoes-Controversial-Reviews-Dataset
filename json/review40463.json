Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the first time I have left a Star Wars film thinking it was missing everything Star Wars.  I want to get behind Rey but there is no training\\, there is no character development\\, etc.  She just is a no one who is able to be wiser than Luke\\, naturally stronger in the force than anyone in Canon.  For Kylo\\, he does not appear to be a worthy adversary at all.  Rey already bested him and now she has the Jedi texts.  Snoke meant nothing.  The resistance vs the order plot seemed inconsequential. In terms of Luke Skywalker\\, his role was underwhelming to say the least.  I have no problem with him becoming pessimistic and isolating himself but he just seemed so out of character to how he has been portrayed in the movies and expanded universe.  Sure\\, I understand that the writers have to move forward with new characters\\, and I also understand that it is great to be able to go a different route (not be predictable) but the way in which this occurred seemed forced.  At the end of the day\\, I do not care about any of the remaining characters\\, which makes it hard to care about how the story finishes.  Much more interested in the Star Wars universe in a different time period with a new story.","true":true}
