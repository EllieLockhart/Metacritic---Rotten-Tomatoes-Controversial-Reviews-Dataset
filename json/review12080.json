Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I agree with Mark Hammil.  \\\"I fundamentally disagree with the direction they took Luke.\\\"  The Finn\/Rose side quest could be completely removed with zero story impact.  The huge build up from the last movie was wasted.  Total lack of character depth.  It was a funny movie\\, and if it WASN'T A STAR WARS MOVIE\\, it would have been great.  However\\, it was.. and they just pissed all over star wars with obviously a vision that's trying to sell toys and extend a franchise.","true":true}
