Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Snoke:throw away character\\, underveloped\\, over hyped. Huge c0ckblock.\\nPhasma: unsatisfying\\, underdeveloped rivalry with finn \\nFinn: Forced romance with rose. Trip to Canto Bight litterally could have been deleted and made no difference to the plot. \\nLuke: behaved out of character. Deserved better. Have you seen the Star Wars movies Rian Johnson? \\nPoe: Crazy trigger happy lunatic\\, gets his team killed left and right. Stages a mutiny. Sends finn and Rose on useless mission\\nNO LIGHT SABER BATTLE\\nADMIRAL ACKBAR DIES OFF SCREEN WTF!!!\\nDISGUSTING\\, AVENGERS-ESQUE SELF-REFERENCES AND DUMB HUMOR EVERY 5 mins. \\nRAMBLING\\, INCOHERENT PLOT\\nLEIA SUPERMAN SCENE WAS LAUGHABLE\\nBIG PLOT HOLES: Knights of Ren? Rey dream sequence?\\n Snoke? HELLO? Are you alive Rian? \\nSo many missed opportunities. \\nbetrayal. \\nEmptiness.\\nEnjoy the money meat grinder Disney:)","true":true}
