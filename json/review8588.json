Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First off\\, I did not read any of the reviews prior to watching this movie. Second\\, I\u2019m a SW geek and I\u2019ll admit that. That said\\, I was very disappointed to where I felt a strong need to review this film and am actually looking forward to Christmas than seeing it a second time tomorrow. In summary\\, the early part of the movie is slow and seemingly treaded over similar territory with the original trilogy. The middle part was a bit confusing and without a purpose other than to take a screen time. The third act was decent\\, but again felt like you\u2019ve seen it before. There are some terrific visuals....and that\u2019s about the high point. We shall see what comes of Episode IX...","true":true}
