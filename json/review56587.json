Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a story telling disappointment.  The portrayal of Luke Skywalker as a self-exiled and disillusioned ex-Jedi warrior\/ knight over what became of Ben Solo under his mentorship is not at all believable.  It makes Luke out to be a man of weak character not able to see a larger picture of life and the value of his own life\\, regardless of what happens to Ben.  Even Hans Solo's demise in The Force Awakens was sorely not believable.  The plot line of the New Order chasing the rebel force in what amounts to a slow motion car chase is nothing but boring to watch.  The side-plot of Finn and Rose's journey to find a code breaker on a casino planet is a waste as it does nothing to advance the main story; how sad!  Captain Phasma\\, who was quickly dispensed with in The Force Awakens without character development\\, again meets a quick end without character development; what is the point of even having her in the story unless to have her model a chrome battle suite and cape.  Ray seems to need little if any skill development with wielding Luke's light sabre\\, in flying the Millennium Falcom or mastering the Force\\, tough to swallow as believable.  Ray's little journey into the black hole was pointless.    I'll end my comments here and say the first three Star Wars films were all we ever needed.","true":true}
