Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Extremely disappointed with Rian Johnsons lack of respect for the Star Wars community. I went on opening night. When the movie ended there was no appaulse just disappointment and confusion.","true":true}
