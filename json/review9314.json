Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Gave it a second chance... just as bad as the first time :( It has all the elements of Star Wars\\, but doesn't nail down the Star Wars tone. Oddly\\, I'll tell you to go see it\\, just because you'll need to experience it for yourself.","true":true}
