Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All flash and jokes\\, but does little to add to the detail on the story of the universe. Villains with no explained motives and new characters that don't even developed are the the surface of the disappointment.","true":true}
