Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had alot of good parts but their were a few bad parts that I really didn't like. The Casino scene should have been alot better introducing us to all types of old and new creatures but what they did is went away from the main plot and shown kids being forced to race be freed which and nothing to do with anything. then was the scene where leia falls out of the ship into space looking like it was over but all of a sudden she turns into Superman\/marry poppins and starts flying threw space. Also the whole mind talks between Rey and Ben Solo were just to much once is okay but 5 or 6 times in one movie was to much. I also can't stand Kylo Ren but not because he is so evil but because he is so weak  and I couldn't stand the girl Finn was with the whole movie. The good was the action the main storyline and the time Rey spent with Luke. I like Rey\\,Poe \\,Finn and BB-8 their fine  and hopefully will come back even stronger in the next movie. The Movie was good but far from great and nowhere near a 94% I have no idea what the critics are talking about","true":true}
