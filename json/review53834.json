Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Heartbreaking to see the heroes of the story we grew up to turned into punchlines for jokes and gotcha moments. That would still be okay if it was justified with a story\\, but honestly - it feels like the corporates in a hurry to kill off the older characters so they can launch their second mcu without any worries. Some brilliant visuals are the only positive point of this film. The script and the intent it's biggest villain.","true":true}
