{"101487":110056,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-31","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"BEWARE STAR WARS FANS :\\nThe Last Jedi is a thoughtful movie with decent acting and great visuals and sounds.  Much of the new stuff\/ideas developed are controversial\\, but I like most of it\\, except Leia jumping into a ship that she was just blasted out of...Two reasons: It completely negates the importance of Ren not shooting his mom but her dying anyway (which is a better end to someone who actually died in real life) and it rests on the premise that Leia felt herself so important that she needed to live for the cause\\, though she is definitely the person who would say that the cause is about more than any one person...The ideas are controversial\\, but I like most of it.  This movie is pitiful because of poor character development\\, subplots of no consequence\\, bad bad humor (not any worse necessarily just twice as much)\\, and plot holes too many to write.  Here's a short rant of things that the average fan will hate:\\n1. Carrie Fisher dies in real life.  Let's do something about that in her last movie.  Have some balls and kill her off in the scene in which she is supposed to die.  Forget about legacy.  Billie Lourd can be her legacy.  She did great\/fine.\\n2. Mark Hamill is not a great actor - he is ok.  He can be an acting consultant.  Too much time on screen.  There's a reason that he isn't in any other movies\\, and saying it's because of the importance of Luke Skywalker is a cop out.  Harrison Ford had no problem getting roles.  There's a reason for that.\\n3. Canto Bight mission means nothing.  They don't do what they are supposed to - luck gets them to a codebreaker\\, luck gets them picked up by DJ when they are pursued.  The whole 30-45 minute subplot means nothing if luck is going to determine everything.\\n4. Is Captain Phasma a character or not?  Can we actually use her for something or did we just kill her off for no reason?  And why does everyone die except Finn and Rose in that shot.  Lazy scene - the area AROUND them could have been shot up so that they aren't the only ones alive again in a room of hundreds (LUCK again)\\n5. Um if droids could drive AT-STs\\, then they would have already.  In the same way that drones replace boots on the ground.  WTF BB-8 are you kidding me??\\n6. Snoke looks like a gay new year's party coordinator or Sigfried...who's brilliant idea was this?\\n7. I'm cool with Rey having unimportant parents...Snoke too though?  One or the other man.  We can't just have a bunch of nobodies with no background infiltrate a world of nepotism.  At least explain some of the rise to power.\\n8. Snoke controls two of the most force sensitive people in the galaxy\\, but is fooled by a simple lightsaber shift right next to him??\\n9. Out of gas?  Really?  Like as the main plot?  Ok Rian\\, I like it.  Greenlighted\\n10. Yoda says nothing important.  There's not point to him.  I love him\\, but it's insulting to the audience to put him in for memberberries.  Great job however using the original puppet and puppeteer that's a great nod.\\n11. Caretakers for comic relief?  Who the crap are they and who cares?  And I don't give a crap how they or Luke drink milk or eat fish.  Unnecessary.  I'm already suspending belief by watching a movie about goddamn space travel\\, lightsabers\\, and blasters.  Can we please spend that time on other stuff??\\n12. People sensitive to the force feel the presence of other force sensitive people\\, not the sense of astral projected force sensitive people.  The scene could have been better if Luke was used differently\\, or actually did something.  No lightsaber fight?  He didn't really do anything except stand there.  How much energy does that take up?  \\n13. One of the best scenes is the fight scene in the beginning\\, the premise of which is also weak.  We don't know how important this super cannon thing is\\, so why make a plot line where Poe risks all those lives just to take out one ship??  Especially considering there's like no one left in the rebellion.  He's supposed to be reckless\\, but not crazy and idiotic.  If the movie just expounded on why it was so important\\, it may have made that decision more sensical.\\n14. Just timing and audience knowledge in general...it seems like the heat of the movie is 18 hours of fuel left\\, and everything happens in that short time frame.  Including Atch-To\\, the whole Canto Bight side mission etc.  This movie could have spent more time making simple concepts actually make sense\\, make their difficult concepts have slightly more background\/explanation\\, and cut the humor and unimportant crap in half.  Is this little kid sweeping important or not important??  If nothing matters\\, why include it?  Explain why nothing matters and Luke is now a Nihilist and maybe the movie wouldn't suck so much.  The parody moments of this movie should not have been put next to such important big ideas.  This isn't a Shakespearean play in need of comic relief.  It is a story with background told over generations.  Campy humor is an element\\, but it deserves a few lines\\, not a third of the movie.  The story is still supposed to be about life\\, death\\, g v. e and overall moral ambiguity.  All the best scenes in Star Wars history involve tension\\, meaning\\, and moral conflict.  One of the best things Rian does is place Luke's memory against Ren's in almost identical\\, yet different recreations of one event.  To show the difference of memory v. perception and as a guide for the future and decision-making.\\n\\nIdeas are strong\\, but not enough to save a weak\\, weak story.  Movie cared too much about self-importance and not enough about making sense.\\n\\nStar Wars fans SHOULD see this movie; just drop your expectations to a much lower place than you thought you'd have to...","true":true}
