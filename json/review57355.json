Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie pulled  off what I thought was impossible\\, dismantling everything great about star wars....the total destruction of Luke Skywalker's character is unforgivable....I could accept such a change if were earned....and the whole plot relied upon very dubious technical aspects of spaceships. Rather than impart lessons through good story telling\\, it preached and talked down to the audience... This is not star wars\\, this is more like a reanimated corpse that used to be star wars. Star wars needs a true resurrection now after TLJ killed it.","true":true}
