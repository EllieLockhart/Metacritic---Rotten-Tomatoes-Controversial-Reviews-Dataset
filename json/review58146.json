Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow I had to come back and REdo my review as it was taken off haha. Well this film has proven to be a flop and has killed the franchise in so many ways its practically unwatchable now.  Just like doctor who and star trek been destroyed by sjw politics cray cray kk gone into hiding now since its release never to be seen by human eyes I wonder why and Disney didn't even fire her lol hollywierd the only place you fail upward (slow clap). Oh and stealing the star wars theory's fan film well done guys well done I know you gave it back but still what a mistake. Looks like the house of mouse has turned into some mafia style company now. Even if you manage to make episode 9 the best star wars movie in history I'm still not going to see it Disney are theives plus calling me a RASICT and misogynistic for months don't help when I'm in a relationship with an asian girl. I'm going to make it my life's long work to destroy any sjw film or show on rt now as it's a cancer and should be eliminated this very instant.","true":true}
