Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Without explicit spoilers\\, the thing I loved about this movie is that just when you are convinced you know what is going to happen\\, something else happens.. sometimes in multiple layers.  This is the freshest Star Wars since episode VI. This one is going to just get better the more time we have with it.","true":true}
