Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The issue I have with this film is that it was just plain UGLY. People chasing each other\\, the camera chasing them\\, all over the place\\, no elegance\\, no aesthetic consistency\\, no care for colour palettes\\, not a single good shot. I have nothing against the progressiveness of the film\\, I love that. But unlike previous Star Wars films\\, this one looks like the usual crappy\\, modern\\, silly\\, CGI-laden\\, action blockbuster with zero artistic ambition. Even the prequels had their moments of visual mastery. Nothing like that in the Last Jedi. Just plain ugly.","true":true}
