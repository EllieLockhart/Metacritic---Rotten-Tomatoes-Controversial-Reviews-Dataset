Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was terrible.  There are time line issues that are almost inescapable (5days on the island = 18 hours of running out of gas in space).  It also feels like a political propaganda film.  At moments felt more like space balls than Star Wars.","true":true}
