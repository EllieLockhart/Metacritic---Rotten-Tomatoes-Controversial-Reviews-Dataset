{"101487":189779,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To start off\\, this is a solid movie with a great plot\\, special effects and acting. Carrie Fisher\\, Mark Hamel\\, Daisy Ridley and the other stars in this movie give a performance of a lifetime. However this does not mean that this movie is without its flaws. For example there is a long part of the movie where Rose and Finn travel to a planet with a casino to try and find the master codebreaker so they can break into Snoke's ship. The only thing I got out of this was that animal cruelty is bad\\, yes I obviously agree with this\\, but in a Star wars movie this feels out of place. Also\\, the ending of the movie felt sort of rushed. After projecting himself across the galaxy to try and buy the Rebels some time to get away\\, Luke suddenly dies. Now this is not without reason\\, because this act of using the force must of took a lot of strength and energy. Killing Luke Skywalker off is a huge miss for the next movie. After about 40 years of not seeing Luke back on the big screen this is what we get. I can see where the frustration of Mark Hamel comes from. He could of even had an even more emotional death in the next movie\\, if he sacrificed him self\\, or something along those lines. He did not need to die in this movie. Which brings me to General Leia. What are they going to do with her in the next movie due to the terribly tragic death of Carrie Fisher\\, I honestly have no idea. Now if any character was going to die in this movie\\, it should have been her and not Luke due to that event. Lastly\\, Snoke dies in this movie. Unless if there is a way that he did not die\\, this is a waste of a great character that had so much potential. Another character that gets thrown in the trash is\\, Captain Phasma\\, which I can understand more than Snoke. That character is more like a nod to deadly bounty hunter\\, Boba Fett. To finish\\, Star Wars the Last Jedi was a great movie\\, and I enjoyed it\\, the plot twists were amazing\\, and the cinematography was second to none.","true":true}
