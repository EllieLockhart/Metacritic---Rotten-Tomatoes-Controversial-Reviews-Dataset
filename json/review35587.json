Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a fantastic return to a galaxy far far away. The pacing drags a little in the middle of the film\\, however every single actor delivers a stellar performance\\, especially Mark Hammill. The film takes characters in a new and exciting direction whilst still maintaining that Star Wars magic. The entirety of TLJ looks beautiful\\, with many jaw dropping battles on ground and in space. I absolutely cannot wait until Episode 9. Ignore the hate\\, dismiss the anger\\, this is the Star Wars film you're looking for.","true":true}
