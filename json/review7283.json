Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Epic fail at the end... Luke wasn't given the chance to use his light saber\\, the only thing many of us wanted?? It would have been better if Luke landed his X-wing and you know who started flying it around since his black X-wing was blown to bits. Luke could have easily been injured and played a wise grandpa yoda role in episode 9\\, giving way for the new main characters. Episode 8 caters to the new generation and all the old peeps who Luke was a hero for are left disappointed including @MarkHamil. This movie for me is a lost hope. I no longer care about Star Wars like I did before seeing episode 8. One fanboy lost.","true":true}
