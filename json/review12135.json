Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a huge Star Wars fans. I love the originals\\, and like the Prequels. I loved the direction that Abrams took for Episode VII. But Johnson absolutely butchered this movie. This is by far the worst installment. I'd rather watch an entire episode focused on Jar Jar than watch this again. His character asssasination of Luke is a travesty to Lucas' original intent. The lack of back story on Snoke\\, The Knights of Ren and Rey's parentage are colossal failures. There is nothing redeeming about this. I can only liken this to the release of Go Set a Watchman\\, in which an iconic character in Atticus Finch is butchered into being a racist and the very thing that he stood up against. Disney and Rian Johnson have done a disservice to George\\, the characters and to the fans. Luke would never have become so jaded. After Obi-Wan lost Anakin and failed him\\, he didn't become a hermit who turns himself away from the force. And Ben would have taught Luke that lesson.\\n\\nI honestly wish this movie was never made.","true":true}
