Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was pretty good\\, it looked nice\\, but I didn't have fun with it it was one of those movies where I just sat in the theatre and watched them when it was over I was like \\\"ight it's over\\\" then I left\\, it was not thought provoking or even that entertaining","true":true}
