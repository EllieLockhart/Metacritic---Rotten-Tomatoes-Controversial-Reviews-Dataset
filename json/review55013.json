Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie can be summed up by one observation.  I was in a packed theatre on xmas weekend in the late afternoon.  This is a formula for a great time.  But the crowd was silent.  No laughing\\, no cheers\\, no gasps or oohs or ahhs.  Nothing.  Everyone in the theatre seemed half asleep\\, bored\\, and just waiting for the pain to end so they could go home and do something fun.  I could go on for pages about the lack of basic storytelling\\, a broken plot that constrained the pacing from the first minute\\, the time wasted on useless subplots that did not advance the story.  But I think the audience sums it up.","true":true}
