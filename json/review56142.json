{"101487":169322,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILER FREE REVIEW\\n\\nThis is only after one viewing\\, but I have pretty strong feelings about movies from franchises I love\\, so I doubt my feelings will waver with a second viewing. The main plot is great. Our new heroes\\, plus some new additions\\, are in a race against time following the events of The Force Awakens. The scope of the film is small\\, but it seems dragged out painstakingly across its two and a half hour run time just to give screen time to characters old and new. A lot of what happened on screen could have easily happened off screen without detracting from the story. While we're constantly treated to stunning visuals and the best fan service\\, from returning characters to returning musical scores from the original films\\, there is just as much that's been left out; especially key elements from The Force Awakens. \\n\\nMy biggest gripe with The Last Jedi is it's use of humor. While Han and Leia's snark\\, R2 and BB-8's antics\\, and most everything in between felt right at home and very much a part of Star Wars\\, this movie has (in my opinion) some very out of place jokes shoehorned into. There were multiple times during the movie(sometimes during very cool and intense scenes) that some National Lampoon's level gag would crack the immersion of the \\\"Star Wars\\\" wonder. It's as if director Rian Johnson took cues from Family Guy when deciding where to fit in the humor. In my opinion\\, one of the best scenes of the movie is immediately ruined in a split second by what I assume was an attempt at some light humor and coolness\\, but it only detracts from the high stakes tension that builds throughout the movie. While some of the humor works\\, most of it feels poorly timed and out of place in the Star Wars universe\\, it really left a bad taste in my mouth before the half hour mark.\\n\\nAll that aside\\, it's another Star Wars movie\\, isn't that what we all want? It was visually stunning\\, the score was magical and the twists were perfect. The movie was great fun to watch and there were truly fantastic scenes; but if you have to wade through a poorly paced and outright boring subplot that has little payoff\\, AND cringeworthy humor\\, can it really be THAT great of a movie? \\n\\nSome people are calling it 2nd best to Empire\\, but those people just have \\\"the new Star Wars is here and it's perfect\\\" fever. The Phantom Menace is referred to as the worst movie in the Saga\\, but aside from stale acting and dated CGI\\, it's more we'll put together than The Last Jedi.","true":true}
