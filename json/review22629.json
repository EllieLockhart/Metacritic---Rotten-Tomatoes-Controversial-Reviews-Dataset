Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"literally the best star wars film to date. definitely has problems\\, but has been the darkest\\, most character driven narrative in the star wars universe.","true":true}
