Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"That was A very boring and disappointing movie\\, acting was Just OK BUT THE Script Was shit. A directionslESS STory\\, confused PLottS AND STUPID subtext with ODD MEssages (BURN BOOKS??) . IT IS HARD TO CONNECT TO ANY CHaRACTEr SHOWN\\, NO DEPER UNDERSTANDING FOR REAL EMOTIONs AND NOT in TOuch WITH THE ESTABSLISED UNIVERSE ON THE WHOLE. IT IS A SHAME.","true":true}
