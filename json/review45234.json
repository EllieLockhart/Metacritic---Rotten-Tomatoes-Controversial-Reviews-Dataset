Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unsatisfying. It looks great\\, most of the humor works well enough and the score is on point but the story is the worst I've seen in a Star Wars movie. Most of the questions you have after 'the Force Awakens' are answered\\, but in the most disappointing way possible. The plot feels lazy and has holes as big as the death star. I wouldn't even be upset if they retconned this entire movie.","true":true}
