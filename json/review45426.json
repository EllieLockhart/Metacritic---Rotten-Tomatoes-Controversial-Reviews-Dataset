Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very boring movie. I yawned 4 times. None of the new characters are compelling enough to care about. Almost all of the attempts at humor fell flat. There were two cool sequences in the movie\\, but cool sequences in tent-pole movies are really not that special these days. After viewing Episode 8\\, I could not care less about Episode 9.","true":true}
