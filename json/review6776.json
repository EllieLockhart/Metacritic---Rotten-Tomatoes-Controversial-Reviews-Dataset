Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't listen to the petulant fanboys with their  self-righteous notion's of what Star Wars is supposed to be. While not perfect\\, this film is still fantastic despite its few flaws. Poignant\\, often funny\\,  loaded with action and spectacle and most importantly heart. The naysayers are always the loudest voices in the room and you would be best to ignore them\\, go in with an open mind\\, and prepare to have a blast.","true":true}
