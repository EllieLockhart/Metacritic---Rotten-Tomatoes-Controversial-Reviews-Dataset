Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Been a Star Wars fan since I was a little kid.  The whole movie was great.  The last 30 minutes were phenomenal.  I loved the story that unfolded with Luke that is a full circle with his character.  Great effects\\, great story and great fun.  I'm sad to see the backlash from a small group of Star Wars fans that should know better.  \\nThey think Luke was too dark\\, I think the story plays out just as it should.. past failures repeating themselves and I thought it was beautiful.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  One of my favorites in the series now.","true":true}
