Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Im old guard i grew up watching star wars over n over again. These modern ones are NOT star wars. They had potential but were disappointments if your a long time fan. At 2.5 stars i was being generous. Plot holes and many bad decisions. The ideologies injected are such a turn off.  Imo have zero rewatch valueb","true":true}
