Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi was so disappointing. Pointless side characters\\, tried to make the movie funny throughout\\, regardless of your views- there are multiple subliminal political messages (it's star wars\\, really?)\\, oh and everyone is soft in this movie. No villains or true heros. Just soft\\, spineless millenials who shoot laser guns. Don't even say Rey... apparently 10 min of Jedi Training makes her more powerful than any other Jedi? Here's what really happened\\, Mickey Mouse found a new series to make money from. Fans. Do not watch. Also\\, George Lucas... I'd like to take this time to apologize for complaining about episode 1. I would rather have a remastered version of episode 1 and watched it 10 times before watching this travesty. Take Star Wars back. Please George\\, you're our only hope.","true":true}
