Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The bar has been lowered... to the floor.\\nThe script is trash.  Nothing happens for a reason.  Plot twists that don't make sense and don't advance the non-story.\\nUnacceptably terrible as a movie on its own merits; treasonous as a Star Wars film.","true":true}
