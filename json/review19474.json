Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"it's the weakest\\, horrible star wars film. the main premise and plot of the film is boring and nothing really happens in it\\, it brings barely any new lore to star wars and it's new characters\\, the acting is okay by some and cringy by others. and u can tell the film tries to be funny but it ends up ruining the film. the only redeeming part of the film is the visual effects and sound effects","true":true}
