Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was generally weird\\, the story didn't connect at all\\, the first half was broing\\, the second half just plain confusing. Great characters are killed off way to early or miraculously survive to the point where you wish they would die. THe prequels were bad but at least they had epic lightsaber battles\\, something this movie lacks despite showing potential for so many awesome battlescenes. It's also very stuck to one place and full of plot fillers that take the emersion away and make the movie unbearable to watch. But I would say that the biggest sin is that it doesn't feel like a star wars movie. I generally just feel disapointed.","true":true}
