Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"all of the mansplaining in the world cannot detract from the many revolutionary and even just plain fun twists and complexities in this revisited star wars universe. are there plot holes? when haven't there been- return of the jedi was the worst for that-but i think what mostly irritates the naysayers is too much investment in a standard\\, male-centered\\, conventional bang-up western shooter-style mentality. which\\, by the way\\, the force and its concepts have always transcended. and here they are further transcendent. and it is a breath of fresh air.","true":true}
