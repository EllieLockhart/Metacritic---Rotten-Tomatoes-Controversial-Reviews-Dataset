Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is going in the top 3 Star Wars films of all time for me! I absolutely LOVE this film\\, it takes risks\\, challenges our characters and takes them in completely new and unexpected directions. I've seen the film twice and any little things that might bothered me a little were not nearly as bad as the first showing. The comedy works and complements the dark times.","true":true}
