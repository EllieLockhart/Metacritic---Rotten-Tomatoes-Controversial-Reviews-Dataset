Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(Spoiler Alert)The basic rip off of Battlestar Galactica of the plot line of a huge\\, menacing fleet of ships\\, chasing a single ship across multiple light speed jumps is practically plagiarizing Battlestar Galactica\\, with its FTL jump.  At least in Battlestar Galactica\\, the Xylons knew how to fire their weapons at Galactica.  Five First order ships and one dreadnought come into range\\, and only the dreadnought fires.  And while the rebel ship has rear shields\\, the dreadnought has no forward shield at all\\, or deflector dish\\, so one x-wing can come in and pick off their cannons one by one.  Right.  The other totally ruined plot line is the obvious romantic interest with Poe and  Rey.  Instead he is pared off with a marginal actress\\, a new and quite annoying character...what a waste.   And the First Order lead by white males\\, and rebels led by female generals a tired genre.  People go to the movies to escape their lives\\, not be confronted by more left wing bashing.","true":true}
