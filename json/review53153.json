Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful! Wish they never bothered making this film! Force Awakens left me excited and wondering what would happen next. There was so much potential after Force Awakens but they just wasted the opportunity!\\n\\n\\\"I can't wait to find out who Rey's parents are!\\\" \\nOh there no one\\, she's no one! \\n\\n\\\"I can't wait to see what happens with Luke!\\\"\\nOh he's become a bit of a dick an throws the light saber over his shoulder!\\n\\n\\\"I hope they give us an emotional good bye to Carrie Fisher as she has died in real life\\\"\\nOh no she's survived and is flying through space like Mary Poppins and will now be CGI'd for the next film! \\n\\n\\\"Who is this powerful Snoke?\\\"\\nOh we don't know what his back story is and he's died easily!\\n\\nI can go on and on with other crap that irritated me! I actually couldn't wait for the film to finish and felt so angry when leaving the cinema. Force Awakens and Rogue One I couldn't wait for the Blu-Ray to come out\\, I couldn't wait for the merchandise! This film has been on Netflix\/Sky and I have had absolutely no interest in re-watching it. I can't even bring myself to watch Force Awakens as it just irritates me to think they ruined it all with The Last Jedi.","true":true}
