Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hello\\, I am former president Millard Filmore and unlike the other dead presidents reviewing this movie\\, I am most personally offended by this moving picture. It is incompatible with the public interest\\, it menaces beloved characters from our childhoods\\, and engages in gerrymandering amongst the fandom. I did however enjoy Yoda's joshing & tomfoolery with Luke\\, therefore two gold stars for that. I must now retire back to my grave. NICE TRY\\, DISNEY SHILLS","true":true}
