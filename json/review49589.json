Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"wowowowowowoo greatest movie ever man i like how they made a specific character to for every stereotipe\/race\/sexuality it was especially good when they made the asain girl and fin kiss that felt like the perfect time for that i totally didnt just want them to be associates. but then again maybe we'll have an orgy in the next stay trek movie","true":true}
