Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Arguably the worst star wars movie to date in my opinion. I had been hoping the seventh (which I thought was decent) would be a movie to get fans back into the Star Wars fever setting up a great 8th movie. I was very disappointed. They butchered the main villain who isn't intimidating at all\\, the context of the entire story made no sense based on the events of the last movie\\, they tried way too hard to bring in humanitarian themes when one side is literally called the \\\"Dark side\\\"\\, NONE of the new characters are very engaging\\, half of the movie was spent on an irrelevant plot point that should have been avoided if they weren't desperate to fill up screen time with garbage\\, and they killed off all of the old characters that people actually care about. There are many more infuriating things about this movie that involve more detail into the plot. Don't listen to the critic score on this one\\, this movie was a huge disappointment.","true":true}
