Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Complete waste of time\\,\\nCarrie Fisher steels the show for jumped the shark.\\nDid you like snoke? To bad Darth maul had a more fleshed out back story and life expectancy. \\nDo you like yoda from 5? Good news they cropped him out and put him in 8 and dubbed over it. Disney has been doing that for a while.\\nLuke is now more whiny then his father before the mask.\\nOh no ship is about to.... nope everyone evacuated safely\\n1 bomber can take out a some logarithmically so-called star destroyer so glad they can defend against 1 single attack\\nToo many cooks = this movie is bad","true":true}
