Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It seems to me that this movie received a lot of backlash for changing things that fans loved: the characters. Many people were infuriated by the movie's treatment of Luke Skywalker\\, saying that he acted horribly out of character and was not treated like the hero he was. However\\, I thought it was far more interesting to see Luke fail\\, to show him as a human being like he was in Episode IV and V. In fact\\, in the end\\, Luke never acted out of character. When the time came\\, he rose to the challenged like he would have done in the past. All his hesitation was the result of his failure with Ben Solo\\, and it was not just justified but a long time coming. From the prequels to the original trilogy\\, the Jedi have been wrong\\, telling Anakin to smother his feelings and Luke to kill his father. Luke's hesitation was the result of the realisation that the Jedi was not the perfect organisation many viewers assumed it to be. It made sense. Luke was not wrong; the audience merely assumed he was. *SPOILER* After all\\, in the end\\, Kylo Ren did turn out to be the monster Luke thought he was. *SPOILER*\\nThe other common criticism is that this movie pushes an \\\"SJW agenda\\\". Critics point to the impression that many of the protagonists were diverse while the antagonists were not\\, and that male characters\\, in particular\\, were constantly shown to be at fault. However\\, upon closer inspection\\, this really isn't true. Yes\\, the main protagonist\\, Rey\\, is female\\, but she isn't right in this movie at all. *SPOILER* She fights Luke for most of the movie\\, then believes in Kylo Ren when he was lost to the Dark Side\\, causing her capture. She is saved by Kylo\\, but only because he wants to rule instead of Snoke. Meanwhile\\, Luke is actually right in the end and dies a hero's death. Rose dies saving Finn\\, but Finn is just as heroic as he was about to give up his life to attempt to destroy the cannon and save the rebels. The only instance where a woman is shown to be more correct than a man is with Holdo and Poe\\, as Holdo's plan was the one that almost worked and saved everyone\\, but this is not blamed on his gender but on Poe's disrespect for authority and impulsiveness. Anyway\\, Phasma was a villain as well\\, and Finn clearly bested her in a fair fight\\, so that makes the tally even for both genders. Meanwhile\\, in terms of race\\, this movie is more diverse than most\\, with Finn being black and Rose being Asian but the rest of the speaking roles were white anyway\\, so how is that \\\"SJW\\\"? All in all\\, I think that the movie was more diverse than most\\, so some people thought it was an \\\"SJW movie\\\"\\, when in reality\\, it's just sad that women or non-whites cannot be shown without the movie being accused of pushing an agenda.","true":true}
