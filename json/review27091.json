Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the most visually and amazing sounding films\\, it has one of the most disappointing stories that has set the wheels in motion to bring down the biggest franchise.  Focusing more on being politically correct\\, this film scrapes all previous rules in a world built over the last 40 years\\, and rips off many other films trying to be \\\"original\\\". I feel sorry for JJ Abrams; he took the massive Star Wars pressure\\, and restarted the franchise with a familiar story\\, with lots of stories that needed to be answered\\, only to have Rian Johnson shit all over them. I honestly have no idea what we are supposed to be looking forward to in the 9th film. JJ has his hands full. Please don't let Rian Johnson back in the building again.","true":true}
