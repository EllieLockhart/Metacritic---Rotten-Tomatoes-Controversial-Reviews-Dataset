Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly my Kids loved it\\, I really didn't care for the special effects in some areas with the ships looked bad and poor physics with gravity in space.  The really young actor as a fighter pilot was unrealistic\\, Luke just wasn't the Luke I would have expected\\, boring.  None of the characters backgrounds were even developed.  Overall a teen action flick worth forgetting.  Holding my breath for the last installment.","true":true}
