Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After hearing other people talk about the movie I figured I'd still probably at least enjoy the movie even if I wouldn't love it like the last one.  However I am shocked at how disappointing this movie was!  Snoke was nothing more than a plot device with zero payoff to who he is\\, Rey's parents end up being nothing\\, Luke's death at the end is totally \\\"wat\\,\\\" and it basically made every male in the movie into either a blundering idiot or a villain while every female was righteous\\, smart and valorous... I'm all for equal male\/female treatment but this was not equal at all.  The story was filled with holes and totally broken.  It had a few cool action sequences which were neat and some humor here and there but otherwise\\, a major disappointment.  I would rate this one as being just as bad as Phantom Menace.","true":true}
