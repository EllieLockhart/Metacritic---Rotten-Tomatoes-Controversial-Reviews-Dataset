Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let me start off by saying that I've been a huge fan since the original films back in the 80s. Unfortnately\\, like many of the other fans\\, I left the movie somewhat disappointed. I really wanted to like this film and kept waiting and waiting for the movie to get better\\, but it just never happened. They just need to reboot the entire star wars series and start off from scratch. I think Disney should try using a darker angle with more Jedis. Thats what I always loved about the movies\\, the Jedi and the Jedi battles.","true":true}
