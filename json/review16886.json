Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In the past\\, I had always looked at the Rotten Tomatoes score before going to see a movie. After seeing the hate for The Last Jedi\\, I don\u2019t think I will let that influence my moviegoing decisions going forward. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie both times I saw it. I have to believe that people are using bots to hurt the score of the movie. Don\u2019t let fake reviews make decisions for you. While the movie is not perfect\\, there is enough there to make it \u201cmust see\u201d. It may even take a second viewing to get the whole picture of what all is going on. When I go to see a movie in theaters\\, I want to be entertained and I was very much entertained. Don\u2019t go expecting this or that to happen because you will just be disappointed if it doesn\u2019t. There\u2019s nothing wrong with thinking about possible outcomes\\, but remember that it is good to be surprised when watching a movie. I feel that Rian Johnson did a great job with this movie and look forward to seeing what comes next in this trilogy. Some people hated that The Force Awakens was a rehash of A New Hope. Now people are hating that this one is different. It is also a bad thing to look for \u201chidden agendas\u201d. Go to the movie with an open mind and you might be surprised.","true":true}
