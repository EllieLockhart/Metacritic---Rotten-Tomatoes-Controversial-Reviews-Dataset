Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Giving it 2 stars just because there are some cool scenes and it's star wars. Otherwise.. this is a bad movie. I could come up with a better sequel plot with less plot holes.. and I'm an accountant.","true":true}
