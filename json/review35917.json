Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is the worst Star Wars movie of the complete Saga. This script betrayed the original characters. This movie failed to answer the questions from the previous movie. The story failed to follow the conventions set up in the previous Star Wars films. The new characters were one dimensional and their archs went nowhere. The not-so-hidden political and social agenda trumped what should have been a good film.","true":true}
