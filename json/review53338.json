Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Decent acting\\, amazing visuals.\\nPoor\\, forced through plot. \\nOvert underlying political statements which contribute nothing to the story.\\nComplete retconning of all former lore regarding force and abilities and Luke Skywalker.\\nIntroduction of creatures - porgs - to sell toys and other forms of commercial marketing which serve to erode the film as anything more meaningful then a cash grab.\\nCompletely ridiculous moments put in for comic relief - e.g. Hux and Poe's exchange in the beginning scene.\\n Leia's Mary Poppins moment. What!?\\nEverything about Holdo's character and then her and Leia's unsubstantiated mockery of Poe and the underlying gender politics which insults the majority of Star Wars' audience.\\nPhasma\\, what is the point of her character?\\nWhy try and make the First Order to be completely incompetent when they are supposed to be the terrifying force which is claimed to be such a threat yet never seems to have a redeeming moment?\\nA half-decent film\\, but an awful film in terms of Star Wars. Its hard to see how the 9th film can redeem this new trilogy.","true":true}
