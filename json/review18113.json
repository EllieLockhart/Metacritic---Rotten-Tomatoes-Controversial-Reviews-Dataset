Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was a great movie!  I like that Luke was tormented. Very EU if you ask me. Books had Luke turn to the Dark Side at one point. This film looked great\\, was funny\\, had nice action scenes and a lot of stuff going on. Not sure if I want more for Rey's parents or not. There's reasons for the way it landed and for more. I guess I would have liked more about Snoke\\, but ultimately it's not about him. Bottom line\\, as a lifelong SW fan\\, I enjoyed it and I hope you do as well!","true":true}
