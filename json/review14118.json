Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you thought the prequels were bad\\, wait till you watch this... Filled with dumb SJW\/Feminazi propaganda\\, every single character in this movie was boring\\, and almost all the characters were nobodies even Snoke himself\\, the jokes were dry as shit and no one let out even a chuckle\\, don't waste your time nor  money and for Pete sake DON'T believe the Tomatometer\\, those guys are paid\/endorsed to give good reviews. Rose and that purple hair bitch were so dumb\\, jar jar was more useful and intelligent that those dumb waste of space \\, defiantly never watching any Disney StarWars ever again till they get their shit together\\, it starts by firing the people behind it.","true":true}
