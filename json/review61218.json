The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The game bring you doubt\\, rage\\, sadness and uncontables feelings. When u are in combat u feel fear\\, anxiety\\, adrenaline and everytime u kill someone you feel a little bit of the wish of revenge being sated . the player expect that u gonna kill the antagonist will feel yourself good and the game will be over but the game extends making you play with the antagonist\\, some players just want to go fast by the disgust thtat we have with she but after u see his side their love one each other u start to get empathy. The game makes the antagonist pass by everything what joel pass on TLOU 1 like a divine punishment and the player see that if ellie doesn`t go in search of revenge probably Abby would be killed tryng to protect Lev in the same way that Joel died trying to protect Ellie by she\\, showing up that everything we do here we pay here and go after revenge would make you just lose all u have here\\, searching for what the life gonna already make your hated one suffer. Ellie killing friends of Abby just make herself \\\"killing\\\" his friends\\, and all Abby will pass with Lev will happen irrespective if ellie go after Abby or not\\, this is the moral of the game\\, and if Abby kill Ellie in the end of the chapter (4 day in Seatlle\\, Abby) she will probably would by killed by the rattlesnakes cause ellie go after she showing up that if u save someone you will be saved\\, if you kill someone you will lose someone.\rthe politicians things on the game make some people like or dislike from the point of view political of the individual geeting off the mutuality from the game cause some people doesn`t rate the game by the moral lesson and yes by their owns political views\\, the low rate from users just show how ignorant the world is.\rin the end of the game the player fell empty cause all the rage he have by Abby the empathy fill up\\, this is a feeling that i never feel in my life\\, the empty. the ending fight against abby when ellie is almost killing she and let she go show to us that ellie just want to prove herself that she can revenge joel but if she kill her would\u00b4n make any difference in his life but will just harm the life of Lev\\, a innocent child\\, just she proving herself that she can revenge Joel already help she win the post traumatic stress\r\rThe negative points\r\rgameplay: cause the fact that the game is almost open world\\, exploring becomes sickening as the game goes on and u feel tired out\\, thing that i don`t feel playing TLOU 1 .\rresolution: is extremely beautiful the resolution of the game\\, the bad part is the play 4 make a lot of noise\\, in game i just saw only one drop of frames.\rhistory: the bad part is when Abby almost kill ellie and dina and go out and show the life of ellie and dina on the farm\\, the player lose the empashis to go kill Abby but the game  force you to go after she. Looks like a continuation of a conclusion and every people know when u write a script u can`t write more after finish the conclusion this get more real showing that our lifes is not a script and bringing reality to the game but this is unpleasent.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
