Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bad plot. Bad turn in direction for the story. Feels like they try to soap box so many times. All interesting plot developments were dropped from force awakens. Remember this name\\, Rian Johnson. He is the man that killed Star Wars for many lifelong fans","true":true}
