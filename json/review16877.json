Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In their haste to introduce new characters the new filmmakers have completely betrayed the existing characters and Star Wars mythos. Rian Johnson's treatment of Luke Skywalker is nothing short of character assassination. Total disrespect to Star Wars fans. Epic Fail!","true":true}
