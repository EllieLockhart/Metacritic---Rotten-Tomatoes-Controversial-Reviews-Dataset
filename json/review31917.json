Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoiler Free\\n\\nThis was one of the most rock-dumb movies that I have ever seen.\\n\\nEvery individual character decision either was senseless or became senseless by the next act.\\n\\nThe obnoxious public narrative that this is a daring departure for the franchise and if you didn't like it you are too married to the past is an embarrassing smokescreen to deflect criticism of the most jarring and hypocritical decisions.\\n\\nSW:TLJ manages the herculean task of squandering any good will of the new saga's references to the past as well as any of the meager interesting relationships and dynamics of The Force Awakens in one bloated over-long shaggy film.\\n\\nThe next generation of Star Wars fans and creators deserve better than this.","true":true}
