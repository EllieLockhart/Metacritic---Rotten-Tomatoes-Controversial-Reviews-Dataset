Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Empire strikes back II is a good movie but not a good Star Wars movie.  It has great cinemaphotography and chi however the unexplained reason how the First order conquers the universe in the span between The force Awakens and the last Jedi while it took 3 films for the rebels to retake the galaxy from the empire.  The unexplained reason why Rey is good at everything and how we waited 35 yrs for Luke to have sputtered out the way he did is totally unsatisfying.  If you just throw out reason and understanding and take what Diane tells you at face value its a great movie.  But if you want intelligent and thoughtful story telling that is consistent with the Star Wars universe you will find nothing but unfulfilling disappointment.","true":true}
