Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie stinks. Don't believe the critics. I'm not even a big Star Wars franchise fan. TLJ what can I say \\,bad directing\\, bad script\\, bad acting and how the hell did Leia make it thru the movie.Whats up with Yoda\\, maybe can get his own comedy special on Netflix wiith lines like that. Not sure why they reintroduced Luke back into the Franchise . Luke didnt look that old to give up on life. He did look tired though. Why not just give him an honorable death. A story about Luke killed in battle told by Leia would have been better. Now I'll just remember him as a quitter.","true":true}
