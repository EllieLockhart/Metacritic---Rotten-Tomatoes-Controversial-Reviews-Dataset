Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't listen to the irrational band of angry nerds ripping this movie to shreds. They're upset their pet theories didn't pay off. My favorite thing about this wonderful film is that it constantly surprised me. After three viewings I'm still emotionally invested in it. No\\, it isn't perfect but it's as bulletproof as any entry in this saga has ever been. As a lifelong fan\\, I wholeheartedly endorse this Star Wars episode. It easily ranks in the top two or three of the series in my mind. You won't find finer acting\\, sharper writing or more beauty in any previous entry. Rian Johnson made all the right choices here.","true":true}
