Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After Rogue One single-handedly killed almost all my enthusiasm for Star Wars\\, I went into the Last Jedi with mostly trepidation. And afterwards...I kind of have no idea what to make of it. It's okay I guess\\, but boy is it uneven. There's some really amazing moments\\, the actors are pretty incredible\\, especially Mark Hamill and Adam Driver\\, and the action is used sparsely but great when it delivers. But the tone is kind of a disaster\\, the pacing is all over the place (especially considering how long it is AND feels)\\, and there's some real weird editing. If I was asked to sum up what this movie was about\\, I don't think I could even say. I think there's a great story in here\\, but it feels like it's constantly battling with several other stories for attention\\, and keeps getting in its own way. Eh\\, if you like Star Wars you'll probably like this\\, but I just wasn't really engaged a lot of the time; sometimes I felt like I was watching one of the prequels. I feel like I'm missing something seeing all these glowing reviews. In particular I can't believe people seriously claiming this movie does new and different things for Star Wars: it's such a blatant perpetuation of the exact same cycle as the original trilogy with such superficial tweaks. In the Force Awakens it didn't bother me as much because they were trying to get people back on board with classic Star Wars after the prequel disasters\\, and introduce these new characters with some different flaws to work on. But then this movie squandered almost all of that and just continued to rehash things\\, and it's no longer as justifiable. Massive let-down\\, and leaves me with next to no interest or intrigue for episode 9.","true":true}
