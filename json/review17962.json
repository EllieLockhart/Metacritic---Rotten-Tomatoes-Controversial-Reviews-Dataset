Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think it's the weakest of the new ones\\, but still does enough right. Weirdly\\, it's almost too funny\\, which distracts a bit too much. It definitely feels all of its 2.5 hour runtime and doesn't really get the greatest of momentum as it seems to start-and-stop a lot running between the different storylines.","true":true}
