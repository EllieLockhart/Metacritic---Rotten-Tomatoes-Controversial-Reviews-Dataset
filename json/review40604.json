Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst Star Wars movie ever made.  Plot holes everywhere\\, disjointed and contrived plot\\, horrible subplots\\, destroyed OT characters\\, ultimate Mary Sue\\, wasted character development.  Just an awful movie outside of score and visuals.  First star wars movie I didn't to see a second\/third time in theaters\\, won't be purchasing on blu ray\\, and won't ever watch again.  A disgrace in every possible sense.","true":true}
