Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing\\, a lot of characters established in the last movies are completely ruined (especially Luke and Finn). Only Adam Driver's character is well developed. The script has a lot of incoherences when it comes to the purpose of Luke\\, some subplots are completely worthless and useless to the story (the casino planet with Rose and Finn is boring as hell). However\\, the movie has great visuals\\, it's a decent movie but a terrible Star Wars.","true":true}
