Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this is quite frankly the worst star wars movie. visually just like every star wars movie it's spectacular. the choreography\\, story\\, writing\\, plot\\, story arcs.... or lack there of.... it doesn't follow the lore of the universe. it didn't follow a single plot point from 7. the worst sequel I've ever seen. and I've seen speed 2. zero character development. if you just came to watch something that looks cool. this movie is for you... but just put aside any hopes for character development or plot.","true":true}
