Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is amazing to me how bad this film is. I never expected Disney to make films like the original trilogy\\, but I thought at the very least would well structured\\, planned out and overall enjoyable. However\\, The Last Jedi is just a joke. I left this movie wondering 'is the director schizophrenic?' because his movie was. It was if he never saw the Force Awakens\\, or the original trilogy. It didn't tie in at all with the previous movie and had a pointless subplot. The storyline contracted itself throughout the film. Worse the character of Luke Skywalker was destroyed. In the original trilogy Luke was hero was goodness but in the last jedi he was a dark and crude old man not anything like how a jedi was portrayed! The movie was clearly a political statement.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi was worse than the prequels. Disney has screw the golden goose.","true":true}
