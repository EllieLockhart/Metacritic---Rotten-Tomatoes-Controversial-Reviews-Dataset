Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was quite disappointed. There is a lot of visually impressive scenes\\, but the plot was poorly thought out. Characters acted stupidly or other plot contrivances were there just to generate tension and action; whole subplots were pointless. I enjoyed there was humor\\, but a lot felt out of place.","true":true}
