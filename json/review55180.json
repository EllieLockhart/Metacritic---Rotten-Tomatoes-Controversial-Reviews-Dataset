Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I will start with what I liked... the light saber fight in the throne room was very well done... that's pretty much it.  It was what I would have expected from a mediocre fan fiction - not from a big budget Star Wars film.  So many things in it that made no sense and added almost nothing to the story.  You could have left Finn (who could have been the most interesting character in the entire trilogy) and Rose completely out of the film and it wouldn't have mattered.  I hated how Luke was treated.  The only way I could see Luke turning into what he was in this film was if he believed that he had killed his nephew.  Then I could understand him turning his back on the force and everyone out of shame - but they didn't do that.  They keep introducing new force powers that are well beyond anything we have seen before without precedent to explain it.  Ultimately\\, I am okay with some subversion of expectations\\, but you don't do that in the 8th chapter of a 9 chapter story.","true":true}
