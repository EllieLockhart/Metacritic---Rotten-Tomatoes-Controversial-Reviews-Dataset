Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is the worst movie in the franchise. Completely ruined by Rian Johnson\u2019s absurd sense of the force and a romance between Finn and rose that would never work in a million years. ","true":true}
