Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is awful to watch for any older fans. If you grew up with the saga\\, and invested any emotional attachment to the franchise\\, then no doubt you already felt double-crossed by Disney\/Lucasfilm when TFA was released. This latest instalment seems to be actively trolling the real fan base. When I consider my associates who vaunted accolades upon this movie\\, it has become crystal clear why certain choices were made regarding TLJ plot and characters. This movie is a backlash at the regular Star Wars Joe and Jane. It pushes a millennial attitude agenda so far up your rectum it is truly embarrassing to watch. Watching the poor sap sat near you fawning over hollow platitudes\\, thinly veiled as 'plot' is saddening indeed. The director\\, whilst dismantling as much as he can of the original atmosphere of Star Wars instalments\\, seems to be shooting a parody and roast of it's subject and characters\\, the Y2K generation\\, and all expectations of fan service.\\nIt will be remembered as the weakest of all Star Wars movies\\, which could have delivered so much more but instead elected to be vacuous\\, nonsensical and appease the small minority of fans that are part of the progressive social cancer in both Hollywood and the general public.","true":true}
