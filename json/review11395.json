Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible horrible horrible! I am 99.9% sure Disney paid off critics to rate the film so high. Lost all nostalgia and the jokes fell so flat! Storyline was weak at best and made acting feel strained and forced. There was so much promise after force awakens and Rogue One but unfortunately this movie ruined it. ","true":true}
