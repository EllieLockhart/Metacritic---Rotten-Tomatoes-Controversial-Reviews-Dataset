Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I cannot believe all the audience hate on this movie. I am a fan of the series and this movie expands the mythology. Each character has character arcs that are compelling. There is a sense that the film makers were deconstructing the Lucas-Verse and rebuilding the Star Wars world that clearly speaks to today\u2019s culture. Outside of Han Solo\\, the Star Wars characterization has never been as on the nose as the characters we have in this new batch of films. Strongest of recommends!","true":true}
