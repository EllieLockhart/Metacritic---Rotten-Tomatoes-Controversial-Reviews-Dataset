{"101487":100010,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-03","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After The Force Awakens set the stage for new SW episodes\\, I was pleased and excited. A part of me did wonder what Lucas would have done-might it not have been groundbreaking instead of just competent?-but JJ Abrams's work was competent indeed and filled with such joy and flair that it won me over completely. I awaited next installments with pleasure\\, as curious about the in-story mysteries as I was about the new creators' relationship with the material. Would they manage to finish the story so it comes together on an archetypal level? Or would it deliver only the surface thrills?\\nAfter The Last Jedi\\, such questions seem hopelessly beside the point. The movie is such an incoherent mess that it's ridiculous even to speak of a \\\"relationship with the material\\,\\\" and as for the in-story mysteries\\, they've been summarily dismissed. It's like someone put lots of SW-ish elements in a blender and hit the switch. The director seems to have wanted to subvert genre tropes (a strange endeavor in a SW movie\\, surely?)\\, yet the \\\"subversion\\\" invariably turned out to be a bluff\\, with nothing new and exciting to supplant what was wantonly destroyed. And the studio was there with its crowd-pleasing demands\\, presumably ensuring that we get enough explosions to forget why we're there. To make things sadder\\, there are good\\, even great\\, moments in the movie (Rey's and Kylo Ren's relationship stands out)\\, but overall\\, The Last Jedi fails as a sequel\\, fails to set up the next installment\\, fails to deliver on its own promises\\, fails in a long list of other things\\, and simply fails as a movie. One can barely wrap one's mind around all the disastrous decisions it took to make it.","true":true}
