Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Without giving anything away I liked the first 2\/3 of the movie. What they did with Luke completely pissed me off. The character needs to be treated better then that! More bad words about that but in short the movie gets a 62.5%","true":true}
