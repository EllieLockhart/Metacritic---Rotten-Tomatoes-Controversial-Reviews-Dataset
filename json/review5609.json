Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Didn't enjoy it. 80% of the movie felt like filler and it's awful at being subtle.Whatever happened to \\\"show\\, don't tell\\\"? \\n\\nIt'd be easier to type out the stuff that I liked:\\n\\nBeing introduced to more of the creatures which inhabit the universe; they were all very well done in their designs and mannerisms.\\n\\nDJ scenes.\\n\\nThe shots of Luke standing alone before the AT-ATs.\\n\\nSome of the small touches of humour.\\n\\nYup\\, that's it. A film for diehard fans only.","true":true}
