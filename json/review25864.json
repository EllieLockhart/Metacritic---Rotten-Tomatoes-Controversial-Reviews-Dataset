Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not going to try and embellish my review with much\\, but this movie was AMAZING. The negativity seems to be coming largely from those who wanted it to be their idea of what Star Wars should be\\, rather than a film in which they have no control or decision making power in. I grew up with Star Wars too\\, and I thought this was a GREAT addition. Did things happen I didn't want? Sure. But that is part of movies in general. This was an interesting new and different take on the continuing story while remaining true to SW at its core. Loved it\\, and will be seeing it again soon.","true":true}
