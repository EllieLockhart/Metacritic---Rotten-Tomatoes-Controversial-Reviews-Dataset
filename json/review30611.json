Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Simply awful. Force awakens and rogue one made me believe good Star Wars movies were possible again but this movie brought it all crashing down. I boycotted Solo just because of this film which is sad because I\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM)ve since seen Solo on tv and it\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM)s a great film but emotions are trust in the franchise is hanging by a thread.  From the very beginning with Adrian Edmundon casted as a Officer in the first order the alarm bells started to ring. Then the stupid parody joke between Poe and Hux ending with a your mother joke made me think oh god this is going to be bad. Then there\u00e2(TM)s Leia flying through space and Luke tossing his lightsaber and generally being an annoying morose idiot and it\u00e2(TM)s the only perfect mix for the all time worst Stat Wars movie.  Like many others I\u00e2(TM)m besotted by the films. I grew up in the 70s and 80s and collected the toys and wore out many a vhs tape of a new hope. Such a shame. Shame on writer and directed and producer too.","true":true}
