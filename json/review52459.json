Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A great Star Wars film. Whilst it has its issues in terms of the plot (mostly the Canto Bight plot diversion) and some inconsistencies with its tone\\, the movie worked incredibly well. The movie was more focused on character development and exploring the complexities of our characters\\, and I loved that side of the film. The action was superb. The score was good. All solid performances especially\\, Mark Hamill and Adam Driver. Princess Leia was incredibly well handled and Carrie Fishers performance was great. Her performance and the character of Princess Leia perfectly matched what I envisioned in a future\\, older Leia. She also perfectly matches the Leia we saw in the fantastic novel Bloodlines. There were also some incredibly powerful\\, tense and amazing scenes in this film. It also has some of the best Star Wars scenes ever. The cinematography is also excellent. It has a great sense of style and the frequent use of extreme close ups of eyes allows us to see the eyes of evil and the dark side\\, but also the eyes of hope and the theme of 'resistance' is prevalent and well explored. The ending is also really great. Overall\\, I think it's a great movie. It has its issues and it is not certainly not better than The Force Awakens\\, but I think its a very different Star Wars film and works well in what it wants to achieve.","true":true}
