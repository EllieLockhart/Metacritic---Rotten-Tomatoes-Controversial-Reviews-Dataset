Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While this is far and away from being a bad movie\\, but it also isn't what I wanted it to be. The acting could be better\\, the story could be better\\, and over all could have been a lot less dense. The worst part about this film is the lost potential. ","true":true}
