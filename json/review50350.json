Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A wonderful return the the Star Wars universe that moves into the future  while showing love for the past. A cohesive narrative that could stand on its own\\, it exceeded my expectations.","true":true}
