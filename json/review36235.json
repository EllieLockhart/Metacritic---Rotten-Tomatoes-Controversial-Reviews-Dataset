Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi... Where to begin? I wrote over 20\\,000 words\\, dissecting this convoluted mess of a film already\\, but let me sum it up here quickly.\\nVisually\\, the film is stunning. But unfortunately\\, this is all just film-making magic\\, and it lacks storytelling magic. I don't understand why people say this film \\\"subverts expectations\\\". I got exactly what I predicted was going to happen. They blended elements from Episode V and VI together and made a new messy film. I predicted every single one of the supposed plot twists and found the execution utterly pointless and boring. Worst of all\\, the film not only ignores\\, but actively tries to coutner-act every story-strand set up in the previous film and even sets up red herrings throughout the story that would have been actually interesting if they were allowed to play out\\, only to not dare to go there. That does not subvert my expectations\\, it just makes for bad writing. This is further illustrated not only with a lack of understanding and love for the source material (butchering established characters...)\\, but also with a lack of coherence in the logic of the film itself. Not only does it contradict previous films in the saga\\, it contradicts itself in several scenes. Most viewers may not have noticed this\\, but space ships act like aeroplanes in all scenes. There is no depressurisation in one scene\\, then it appears\\, then it is lacking again in another. Make up your mind! The hyperspace ram was spectacular\\, but completely devoid of logic. So were all battle tactics on all sides and most actions of all characters. The characters can't even make up their minds on whether or not they are The Resistance or The Rebel Alliance. All of this was so we could have multiple convoluted story-threads\\, between which we switch at a nauseating pace\\, while not moving the main story forward by even an inch that all end in a finale that once more sends us back to where we were in 1977 (boring! More of the same. Been there\\, done that!) with one message: Failure. Failure is the greatest teacher. Well\\, let's hope Lucasfilm learns from this catastrophic failure.","true":true}
