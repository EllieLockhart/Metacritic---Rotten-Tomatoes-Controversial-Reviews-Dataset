Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a fan of diversity (e.g. Star Trek TOS) and strong women (e.g. Kick Ass\\, Kill Bill\\, Wonder Woman) but I'm not a fan of bad stories. The last Jedi was so bad\\, it made very little sense\\, and it actually reduced the value of all the Star Wars movies before it. Many of my co-workers feel this is the best Star Wars ever\\, but they also have no critical thinking and just call me a racist because I don't like it. It a sad world we live in now. They will eventually see\\, maybe in 10 or 20 years how this movie single handily destroyed the Star Wars franchise. I'll never feel tension in a future Star Wars movie because I'll always think they can just use the light speed weapon in a small spaceship with a robot\\, and never put anyone in danger. Also\\, Yoda could just come to save the day as a force ghost who is allowed to wiggle his finger and create a massive lightening storm to destroy any bad guys. Thank you Ryan Johnson for writing this without any help and totally disrespecting what made Star Wars the most valuable movie franchise in history.","true":true}
