Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No se por donde empezar. Solo dire que muy frustrante ver como lo que creo George Lucas en 6 peliculas era todo mentira. Que los Jedi no valen pa na ...demasiados personajes que no aportan nada. historias sin resolver\\, demasiadas heroicidades y sobre todo .... demasiado humor para lo que es star wars","true":false}
