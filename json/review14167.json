Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you were born in the 70's you went to see the TFA for Han and Luke. I was disappointed in  that look only appeared at the end.  But i understood Abrams wanted to get the new characters involved and Luke is larger than life.  BUT now\\, TLJ\\, to depict Luke as some wimp and not a great Jedi is one thing but to kill him off at the end?  Why would anyone go see the next movie?? Somehow JJ needs to bring look back.  Maybe he physically teleported or some Jedi disappearing trick.  Luke needs to be in the next movie as a master Jedi\\, fighting and saving the galaxy. Or this next movie fail it will!","true":true}
