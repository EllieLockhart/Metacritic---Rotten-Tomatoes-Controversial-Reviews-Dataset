Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Adam Driver and his scenes are the only redeemable qualities of this movie and still they don't help the audience truly understand his motivations and conflict nearly enough. Dialogue really poor\\, jokes contrived and at the wrong time\\, secondary (and primary) character development really poor and rushed. Modern day political undertones were very heavy-handed. Felt like Rian was more wrapped up in trying to solve every social ill and compose a modern-day progressive Birth of a Nation than to write a good story and it hurt both his causes.","true":true}
