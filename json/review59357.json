The story leaves a lot to be desired in terms of the flow of the storyline. The flashback sequences are not paced constructively and new characters are shoehorned in a manner that the player barely has a chance to invest in their stories. There is a lot going on and the jumping of character viewpoints is jarring to the point that it can be frustrating.\r\rThat being said\\, this game does offer visuals and gameplay mechanics which are breathtaking but this by itself is not sufficient to redeem this lackluster sequel.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
