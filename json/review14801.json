Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have to give it up to Rian Johnson he did and amazing job! He took some brave risks with certain characters. I ultimately felt it was to underwhelming and the death of a certain character left much to be desire. 6\/10 not a bot by the way Disney !!!","true":true}
