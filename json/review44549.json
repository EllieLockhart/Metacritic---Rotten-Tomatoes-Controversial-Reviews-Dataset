Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Total disappointment. Terrible plot   The whole movie was one poor plot device after another. There were some parts that were better than others\\, such as the throne room scene. Even the comedic one liners felt out of place and out of character. Overall\\, wouldn't watch again.","true":true}
