Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is absolute trash. Disney has destroyed star wars forever. Luke literally takes his fathers lightsaber and throws it away like a piece of trash. Wow\\, just wow. I'm shocked by the audacity of disney.","true":true}
