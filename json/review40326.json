Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. The director\/writer appears to be trolling the audience daring you to get up and walk out.  As a stand alone movie it would be bad\\, straight to DVD.  As the eighth instalment in a franchise it is bizarre. I had concerns about the phantom menace but that is a masterpiece by comparison. The only benefit to having seen this movie is that I now know to avoid the new star wars movies in the future.","true":true}
