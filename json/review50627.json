Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"40 years of magic continues for me. Though it was painful to watch at times\\, a number of things in this movie sadden me with great loss\\, a loss of possibilities and yet New Hope Remains. Kind of like losing a great love for newer one . Great full but unsure of the future.","true":true}
