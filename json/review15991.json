Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019m a die hard fan since seeing the original Star Wars in 1978. The Last Jedi will never live up to anything like A new hope. But I thoroughly enjoyed it\\, so different from what I had expected and so much fun to watch even in its long running time. I understand that TLJ is not going to please all Star Wars fans fans. But in my opinion it was great\\, I loved it ","true":true}
