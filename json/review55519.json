Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My wife and I went to see this movie yesterday\\, and we left the theater pretty upset. I started reading online from certain media outlets that fan critics on Rotten Tomatoes should be dismissed because they are bots or trolls. That is a pathetic attempt to justify a bad movie. I am not a troll or a bot\\, and I am so disappointed with this film that I felt I had to make a review. To keep it short\\, this movie has a lot of plot holes\\, leftist political messages and turns physics on its head one to many times with the space scenes in this movie. The worst part about this movie is political messaging. The subplot with Finn and Rose is literally about animal abuse\\, slavery and to smear capitalism. You read that right\\, Disney (company with a 165 billion dollar market cap) attacked capitalism in a Star Wars movie. Put that absurdity aside and just pay attention to the characters and their trends. The male characters are reckless or cowards\\, and the female characters are strong and in power. This is not a reach\\, it is literally what is in the film. This film is by far the worst movie in the franchise\\, and the future for Star Wars looks negative and agenda driven.","true":true}
