Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wonder why this felt like Star Wars made by the Disney corporation... oh yeah\\, it was!  This movie had some beautiful moments (maybe someone was allowed to be creative during those parts) but for the most part\\, didn't feel like it was doing anything new with cinema. It also had a cheery tone eerily close to that of the Angry Birds movie. The writing and casting choices were VERY poor. I'm sure the executives at Disney were under the impression that Star Wars is a mere children's movie: a myth being perpetuated. But the Star Wars I remember had a sith lord killing a son in front of his conflicted father. It had hands being brutally cut off\\, betrayal from friends\\, sex slave allusions\\, creepy creatures in a dark jungle planet\\, being inside a giant worm. I could go on and on. THAT was Star Wars. This is a Disney corporation product.","true":true}
