Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A swing and a miss. TFA set up a few possible storylines for this film and TLJ basically said\\, \\\"no thanks.\\\"  When I saw the \\\"Star Wars\\\" logo during the opening credits\\, I had a huge smile on my face and was on the edge of my seat.  By the end credits\\, I was slumped in my chair with a puzzled look on my face wondering \\\"what did I just watch?\\\"  Luke Skywalker throwing the lightsaber over his shoulder as if to say \\\"who cares\\\" sums up this entire film.","true":true}
