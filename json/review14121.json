Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you turn your brain OFF\\, ignore the entirety of the Star Wars saga that came before\\, love computer graphics\\, and needed further affirmation that your feministic social justice warrior beliefs are in main culture\\, this is absolutely a must see. \\n\\nEveryone else\\, don't give another penny to Disney for this bloody mess. As you keep reading down\\, you will find each and every negative review usually goes to great analytical length with exactly how much the film fails not just to be Star Wars\\, but to have any redeeming qualities in story telling. The positive reviews usually leave a sentence or two and no further analysis is given on WHY they love or like anything. Usually the profiles aren't real as when you click them you get a \\\"user not found\\\" page. So basically this \\\"49%\\\" liked it audience score could be MUCH much lower. \\n\\nI cannot stress enough not to see this film if you haven't already\\, and I'm happy at least to see that most of the real reviews are saying that they will  not see the next Star Wars installment either. Go a step even further\\, see NOTHING created by Disney and force them to realize they need to be creative if they want any money\\, or to still have an audience in the future. Boycott every Disney film\\, including Marvel\\, this\\, any other studios affiliated with Disney. Don't take your damn kids to Disney land. Force them to beg us to come back.","true":true}
