Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good things about this movie:\\n- Some of the best special effects ever seen\\n- Best battles of the entire franchise\\n- Aesthetically pleasing film\\n- Some good actors\\n\\nBad things about this movie:\\n- Some bad actors\\n- Terrible character writing\\n- Dropped several plot points from the previous film in a very anticlimactic way\\n- The humor falls flat more often than not\\n- Some scenes that are supposed to be serious end up being hilarious for all the wrong reasons\\n- Plot is bad and ridden with holes","true":true}
