Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While visually gorgeous\\, the script is awful. Rian Johnson dismisses everything TFA set up\\, destroys characters he doesn't understand and slaps the audience with stupid twists because he is more interested in \\\"subverting expectations\\\" than in telling a coherent story.","true":true}
