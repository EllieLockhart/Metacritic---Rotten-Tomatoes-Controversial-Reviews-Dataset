Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The script is poorly written\\, and the production is being really condescendent towards its audience by showing a mere eye candy to hide a subversive sexist agenda; and yes\\, this type of feminism is sexist as it portrays men as obsolete fools in need of a woman to show them the way. It betrays my beliefs of gender equality and I truly despise any type of sexism.","true":true}
