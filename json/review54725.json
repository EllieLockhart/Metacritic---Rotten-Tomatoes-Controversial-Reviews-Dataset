Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I resisted reading any reviews until I saw it today lest I be biased but i'm going to spill some thoughts as a long time fan.\\n\\n1) Stop with the plot holes - they ALL have plot holes. Its fabricated sci-fi and theres a certain 'suspension of disbelief' that has always needed to exist in these\\, and other\\,  films. Its never going to always line up - chill. (I mean this specifically towards the people plotting out strategic advantages of the First Order - if everyone did everything right\\, the Rebels would be dead and the movie over about 30 years ago)\\n2) I feel disappointed with how Luke was portrayed in this - it definitely feels like there was a better story\\, but definitely script deficiencies because it didn't flow naturally. I write this because there were moments where it felt like it was building up to much something much more epic\\, cut short and i'm not exactly sure why and that's all I could surmise. Either way (trying not to give away what happens)\\, I felt like this was a big letdown for the Luke character. After a whole trilogy focused on him\\, I expected more (from the character\\, not the actor - Mark did awesome)\\n3) It was a good 90 minutes before you really got any action out of this movie - One of the reasons people always flocked to Star Wars was the 'adventure' aspect\\, new worlds\/stories\/technology and this lacked it. It was really a back and forth from what we kinda expected from the last movie\\, so that 'punch' and 'discovery factor was missing.'Old Death Star tech' - gtfo with that - is Finn a historian now?\\n4) Casting was all done very well which is why I blamed the script. I felt the actors and actresses in this did an fantastic job with their characters (Benicio! Nice job\\, bud!)\\n5) Here's the thing - this was a fill-it-in story. This painted in the missing pieces of the last movie\\, and set a story-line for the next one. I understand how people could be annoyed by that\\, but only as by described from what I previously said. Its still a good Star Wars movie\\, but it'll fall towards the bottom of the fanboys expectations. It's still a must see\\, but as far as editing goes\\, it couldve been shortened and more action packed if they did it right.\\n\\nBetter not whiff on the next one\\, Disney.","true":true}
