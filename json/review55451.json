Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Middle chapter of the trilogy is the middle finger to the fans. Mark hamill said he disagreed with the direction of his character and I will agree.\\nI don't mind the jokes\\, the goofy Luke or some of these new creatures. The special effects and battles are amazing\\, some of the shots and locations are something out of concept art.\\nHowever the misuses of characters and disregard to criticised areas of previous films comes down to poor judgement and a complete disregard to the fans.\\n\\nThe worst insult was killing the chances of having these characters getting repaired and improved in later movies.\\n\\nThe trailers were the best part of the movie. Watch them and not the movie if you want to save the memories of star wars but quit watching them after until they fix this mess.\\n\\nOfficially the worst star wars movie. Even worse than cartoon spin off maybe even holiday special\\nAt least people can stop citing that George Lucas directed the worst movies.","true":true}
