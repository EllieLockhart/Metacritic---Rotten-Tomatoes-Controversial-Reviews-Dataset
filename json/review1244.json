Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Apparently The Last Jedi should not be seen drunk.  Can't explain the audience score otherwise.  Arguably the best in the \\n\\n\\nIn series. ? just people pissed that they have to wait for that DUMB Jurassic World sequel to come out.  Here's a thought: if life finds a way\\, why they didn't survive I. The first place","true":true}
