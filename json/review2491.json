Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Avid Star Wars fan my entire life.  Collected action figures as a kid\\, made fan films as far back as 1982.  Loved this movie.  It is not about remaining loyal to a character or validating fan theories about who is what.  It is about the Force.  As Luke said\\, it is arrogance to think that anyone \\\"owns\\\" the force.  It is not about any one person\\, or group of people.  It is bigger that all of that\\, and that is what this movie is about.","true":true}
