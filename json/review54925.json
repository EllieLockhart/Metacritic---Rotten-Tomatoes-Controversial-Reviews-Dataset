Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It\u2019s not a perfect Star Wars movie\\, but it is excellent! Contrary to all the claims\\, there are few\\, if any\\, plot holes. Rian Johnson is a fantastic director that takes some risks breaking the growing predictability of the saga. He offers the audience a film that deviates from tropes without breaking the \u201crules\u201d of Star Wars. Anybody that gripes about this movie suffers from having their own expectations and predilections unmet rather than watching the movie for what it is. My advice is to go in with an open mind and enjoy it. It may take a couple viewings to fully appreciate it\\, but it\u2019s worth it. It should also be noted that the reviews on here with the biggest complaints have the most spelling and grammatical errors. You can draw your own conclusions from there. ","true":true}
