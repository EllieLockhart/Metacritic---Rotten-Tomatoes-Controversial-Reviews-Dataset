Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" encompasses some great visuals and action sequences\\, it's overall plot\\, character development\\, and general tone fall short.  With a disregard for many of the ideas set forth by Abrams in \\\"The Force Awakens\\,\\\" this films attempts to set up the end up of the Skywalker saga in a way that seems almost disconnected from the rest of the franchise.  Interspersed with unnecessary comedic moments in what superficially appears to be a darker film\\, \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" lacks a distinctive voice and has rampant issues with pacing.  A viewing is recommended\\, albeit this movie does strike a sour cord in what started out as a promising new trilogy by Disney and Lucasfilm.","true":true}
