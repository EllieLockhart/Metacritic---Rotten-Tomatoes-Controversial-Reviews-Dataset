Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Most disappointing filmgoing experience I\u2019ve ever had. Gets worse with subsequent viewings\\, can\u2019t being to stress how bad this missed the mark. At one point in the beginning opening night in the theater I leaned over to my son and said \u201cwell this is...different\\,\u201d and all he could say was that he hated it and hoped it got better. It never did. This film managed to completely destroy everything Disney had built up with The Force Awakens and kill any interest from a great many people in seeing this trilogy through. This is pure garbage. I want to forget it ever happened. Trump will be gone in a couple years\\, yet we are stuck with this junk for the rest of our lives. ","true":true}
