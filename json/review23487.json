Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved the movie\\, loved the humor. I guess many fans didn't get their particular fantasies of what the movie was supposed to be about. I like to be surprised\\, and this movie did it for me\\, and some of the people are complaining about (character origins\\, etc.) actually open the doors for side stories like Roge One. I for sure will be watching it again.","true":true}
