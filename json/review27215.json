Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One Star b\/c RT algorithm is messed up and doesn't count half or zero stars.\\n\\nUtter garbage script\\, poor directing and characterization. Disney Lucas film more worried about SJW\\, fem nazi\\, liberal agendas than telling a good story these days.\\n\\nLuke's character assassination was UNFORGIVABLE. \\n\\nThey went out of their way to DESTROY Star Wars as we know it...that ego maniac round head Rian Johnson\\, and the incompetent Cunthleen Kennedy at the helm...I shudder to imagine the damage they've done to SW as a brand in the long run.\\n\\nDo not see this film\\, do not buy this film...the best part is the end credits.","true":true}
