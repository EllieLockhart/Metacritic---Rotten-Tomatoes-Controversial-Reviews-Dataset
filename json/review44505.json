Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To say I'm gutted is understatement. Truly disappointed in this movie. there are so many plot holes\\, and missed opportunities it is unreal. Also no cohesion with pretty much any of the previous star wars movies\\, including The force awakens. A complete mess and a middle finger to all who created star wars.","true":true}
