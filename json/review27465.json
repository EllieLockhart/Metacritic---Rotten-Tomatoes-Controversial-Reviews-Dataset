Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall an enjoyable movie\\, with great characters\\, cool sets\\, and awesome action. However\\, there is one major issue that is a recurring thorn in an otherwise great movie. Idiotic\\, poorly timed\\, unfunny comedy permeates the film in what seems an attempt to turn Luke Skywalker and company into comedians when they should be serious. Inappropriate comedic tones give what could have been fantastic scenes a sense of confusion and unimportance. I will greatly be looking forward to the fan edits that will cut out the idiocy from this overly long movie\\, leaving just the core of a great Star Wars movie.","true":true}
