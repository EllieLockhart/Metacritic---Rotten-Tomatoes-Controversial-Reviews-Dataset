Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I must say\\, I went to see the movie and I had really high hopes. I was hoping for them doing proper justice to two of the most beloved fictional characters ever: Leia Organa and Luke Skywalker. And damn\\, how awful did the authors of the film treat them. Luke was so out of character and Leia was acting so strange. The authors have no respect to the original characters\\, it seems. They just made them bland and cowardly. And now I know why Rebels in this trilogy got their assess kicked so hard. In this movie\\, they are so incompetent and stupid\\, it hurts. And also we can't forget about so many plot-holes and especially the totally pointless side quest of Finn and Rose\\, which was totally unnecessary. Also\\, there were too many characters coming and going. And damn\\, so much lore content destroyed for no reason\\, like Snoke\\, Knights of Ren\\, Luke Skywalker. Sometimes it felt like some fan-fiction written by people who just want to insert their OCs into a fictional universe and don't care about the lore and other character's established personalities. There were some really great scenes\\, but the story was just so bad and unsatisfying. I could continue\\, but even if I forgot to write something here\\, others have already said it. :D","true":true}
