Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Without a doubt\\, one of the weakest entries into the Star Wars franchise. Any film that rivals AotC for its terrible quality -- without the saving grace of Episode 2's Obi-Wan storyline -- is a sign of poor things to come. Just as they butcher the character of Luke\\, Disney has now killed the joy of Star Wars.","true":true}
