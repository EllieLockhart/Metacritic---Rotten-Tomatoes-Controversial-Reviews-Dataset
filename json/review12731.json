Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I created an account just so I can voice my displeasure and feelings of betrayal after seeing this movie. Rather than writing a character driven story\\, the story was written to make plot points happen as easily as possible. Characters like Luke were just used as a means to an end and suddenly departed from their previously established norms. I felt like Luke was assasinated in this film\\, and why no one would tell Poe the plan is beyond me. Half of this movie wouldn't have happen if only Poe knew the plan. Such lazy storytelling. So sad to see where the franchise is headed.","true":true}
