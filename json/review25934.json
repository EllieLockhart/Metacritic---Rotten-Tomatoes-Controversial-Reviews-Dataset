Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"NOTHING could've prepared me for how BAD this was! \\nThis doesn't just scrape the bottom of the barrel\\, it burrows beneath it and digs into a black abyss\\, taking us all with it.\\n\\nEDIT: Audience rating 49%?? Not a chance! Look through these reviews.\\nIts not even 20%! *ROTTEN* tomatoes indeed! *BENT*-tomatoes and *CROOKED*-tomatoes would do just as well.","true":true}
