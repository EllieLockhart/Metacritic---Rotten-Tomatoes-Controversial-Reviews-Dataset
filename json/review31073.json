Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So incredibly disappointed by this movie.  The director and writers should be fired and never allowed near another Star Wars film.  So many plot holes\\, unnecessary side plots\\, too much attempted humor - some did great most were bad\\, totally underwhelmed me.  As a Star Wars fan since a child the one thing I have wanted more than anything else is to see Luke Skywalker fully use his powers in a big way.  I've dreamed of that day.  Instead we get this smoldering crap movie.  You've kill off all the great characters and left us with nothing.  Go next door to Marvel Studios and ask them how to pull together a team of collaborators so when a movie comes out its not then that you find out how underwhelming and bad it is.  Rian Johnson is a huge disappointment and not the one to move this franchise forward.  Rian if you learn one thing moving forward from this horrible movie you put together let it be: Keep it simple\\, manage the plot and give the audience what they want!  Here's a good idea - get out of the Disney bubble and ask for fans' opinions when putting together a script.","true":true}
