Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved the movie. Very ballsy thing for Disney to do. Yes\\, I will admit\\, it has what seems like glaring issues or plot holes\\, but I was riveted and surprised nearly the whole way through. I don't look for perfection in movies that much anymore and was able to enjoy the movie\\, thoroughly as it was. I hope they go in an even more crazier direction in the next film.","true":true}
