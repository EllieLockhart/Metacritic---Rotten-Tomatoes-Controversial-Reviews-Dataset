Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Are there plot holes? Yes. Are there changes to what I knew Star Wars to be? Big time. But I grew up with the original series\\, and lots of viewers found fault in that series as well. This is a new generation\u2019s Star Wars\\, and the excited reactions of the young viewers in the theatre clearly show that in 35 or 40 year\u2019s these viewers will remember fondly this new film. Fan boys need remember that times change\\, and we had our time. Disney knows how to please young fans\\, just like Lucas did when I was a boy with A New Hope.","true":true}
