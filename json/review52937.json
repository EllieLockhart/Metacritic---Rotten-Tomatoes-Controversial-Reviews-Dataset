Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Another total crap shoot in the cash grab that is Disney milking the Star Wars franchise for every penny they can before they kill it completely. The whole story line if Like was a disgrace to the character Lucas had originally portrayed in the original films. All in all its 2 hours of my life I'll never have back and cements the fact that I'll definitely not be seeing episode 9.","true":true}
