Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointed. Such high especations considering the high ratings by critics but I don't know what they were thinking. Oh yeah\\, I knew what they were thinking\\, \\\"I'll write a great review so that I'll get invited back to next years premiere\\\". \\n2 major issues with it that drove me nuts. (SPOILERS)\\n1. Seriously\\, all the original human characters are now dead? The one that should have died is Leia\\, you know since she actually passed. I know that out of their control but still why'd you have to kill Luke. So Rei is going to learn the force from Force Ghost and from books! \\n2. What kind of cruises run out of POWER??!! Seriously the Voyager space craft are still hurling through space for the last 40 freaking years! What about the laws of physics\\, an object in motion stays in motion unless acted by an opposite force. What they should have done is borrow from Battleship Galacta season 1 episode 2. Sure it would have ripped it off but story would have more believable. Better than episode 1 and 2 but barely.","true":true}
