Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"way better than episode 7. Kylo and Rey finally have something to do and Luke is great in t his movie and every time he is in the screen you get that good old feeling. Unfortunately there are some bad parts\\, like the complete Finn ark that was basically completely pointless. The action is great\\, there are multiple things that don't quite fit and if you want to criticize the movie\\, then you can completely pick it apart. The movie has really great moments though and I would lie if I would say that I didnt enjoy it.","true":true}
