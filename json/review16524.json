Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In 40 years\\, one would expect that they could make a film that is at least as good as the original\\, and hopes that they would make it better... NOPE. First things first; fire Rian Johnson\\, please. The story is disentigrating\\, as the plot seems cobbled together with far too many cuts that make the film jumpy and hard to follow. The acting of few is applaudable\\, but is underwhelming as a whole. And while it was good to see some fan favorites and classic Star Wars staples return\\, they didn't truly fit into the story\\, but felt more like an afterthought. Rey's character is undeveloped considering how long she has been known to us viewers and the ending (much like the ending of \\\"The Force Awakens\\\") left much to be desired. Since Disney took over\\, it seems that Star Wars has lost it'a edge and is more concerned with airing current (American) political and social issues on screen than making a decent film that truly is about a time long ago and a galaxy far away that allows viewers an escape from reality.","true":true}
