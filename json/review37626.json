Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is so much hate from the Fanboy audience here on RT. I have to say as being one of these Fanboys and growing up through the \\\"Holy Trilogy\\\" and painstakingly watching the prequels\\, the new bookend Skywalker story arc movies have done the mythology and characters justice. I understand people are going to be disappointed that Rey's lineage is just left to the wind for your own interpretation\\, but  the new direction of the force and what it really means to that universe is the star of this movie and I must say this new director knocked this out of the park. The story does take from its predecessors but it has too\\, its a universe that needs to grow for a new audience to want to follow for the next 20+ years. Without spoiling the movie I can say that this is easily top 3 best Star Wars film and will become canon for years to come. Go do yourself a favor and see it for yourself and be your own judge. May the force be with you.","true":true}
