Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From start to finish Star Wars The Last Jedi had me on the edge of my seat! I was blown away by the emotional impact this movie had on me. I enjoyed the twists and turns. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys amazing cinema and story telling. I won't say more so that I don't spoil anything for others. Just know that your emotions may need time to recover. Wow! ??????????????","true":true}
