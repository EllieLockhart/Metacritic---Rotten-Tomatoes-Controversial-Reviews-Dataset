Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not sure why everyone is attacking this film so harshly. Is it the best Star Wars movie ever made? No. Is it the worst? Of course not but it\u2019s an enjoyable film. There are some sequences that probably could have been cut out (or rewritten) and there\u2019s a couple things that might leave you scratching your head but the amazing second half more than makes up for it\u2019s flaws.
