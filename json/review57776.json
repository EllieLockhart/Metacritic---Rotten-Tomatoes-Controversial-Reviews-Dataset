Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually astounding\\, excellent sound design\\, and for the most part great acting. And that is where the positives end.\\n\\nThe plot is absolutely horrid and nonsensical. Worst star wars movie ever made\\, and this is coming from someone that liked all the previous star wars movies\\, including the prequels and TFA. I went into the theater with an open mind. No theories. No knowledge of any trailers as I avoided them.\\n\\nI left the theater trying to reconcile my emotions in a way that would leave me liking the movie. I failed to do so. Unfortunately\\, the longer you think about the plot of this movie and the completely idiotic decisions that were made in regards to where to take the story you simply get more and more disgusted with what they did to the Star Wars name.\\n\\nI have written a point by point criticism of the movie\\, chronologically ordered\\, and it took me about 45 minutes because there was just that much to find fault in. Horrible movie\\, will not be purchasing this one on DVD which is such a bizarre thing to say about a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
