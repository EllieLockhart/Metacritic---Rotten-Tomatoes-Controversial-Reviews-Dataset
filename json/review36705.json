Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is very intense with many actions with Luke being the best part of it. Johnson really took Poe\\, Rey and Kylo to a more profound level of character complexity. But I personaly didn't like how they easily discarted Snoke. The arch of Finn is very weak and most useless for the plot.","true":true}
