Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The boldest Star Wats movie in a long time\\, The Last Jedi keeps you on the edge of your sit and guessing all the way to the end. This film takes the characters of Rey and Kylo and elevates them to central elements of the Star Wars Universe. Now\\, in Kylo Ren we have the alternative ending to Return of the Jedi: what happens if Darry Vader hadn't been redeemed or turned? What happens if Vader has risen to Emperor? This is Kylo's Path now and it is bound to be thrilling.","true":true}
