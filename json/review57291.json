Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is an abomination. It completely demolishes the nostalgia of Star Wars. It is a complete nightmare of a film. Wish I had never gone to see it\\, because my view of Star Wars is now maimed. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. Disney and Rian Johnson should be ashamed. I\u2019m truly disgusted that they would make something that is so clearly a ploy for money. This is by far the worst Star Wars movie ever made. ","true":true}
