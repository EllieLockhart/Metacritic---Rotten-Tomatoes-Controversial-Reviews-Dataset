Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let me get this straight\\, your telling me Luke\\, who basically offered himself up because he believed he felt the good in  the 2nd most evil person in the universe and felt he could convert him [Vader] and only 2nd in the dark side to Palpatine for the only reason BECAUSE HE WAS FAMILY\\, risking his life!!! AND SUCCEEDED !!!\\n\\nBut his sisters only child his own nephew [FAMILY]and child of his BEST FRIEND Han Solo had some minor dark tenancies and tries to kill him - OMG - a tweener with dark tendancies- and was scared of him and tried to kill him!!!\\n\\nLuke himself went as little dark in the fight with Vader in ROTJ\\, Ray went down the dark shaft without hesitation IN THE SAME  damn MOVIE\\, he did'nt try to kill himself or Ray. \\n\\nArt? This movie shit on every other movie to date and all the lore. \\n\\nA trophy for everyone everyone's a winner\\, blah\\, blah\\, blah\\,\\nLuke was reduced to a Tit milk drinking beta cuck\\, so damn sad for such an epic character.  \\nSearch your feeling you know this is true.....?","true":true}
