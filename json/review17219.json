Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really loved this movie I am actually confused and would love to talk to some people about why they are so upset. I LOVED the playing with exspectations that this movie had! I am guessing the people that are most upset are people that spent a lot of time trying to guess what was going to happen and kinda locked in there ideas. I went in fresh just ready to exsperience and I thought it was awesome. I also loved the flawed broken character that luke has become he's old he's defeated and it shows in this movie. But in the end he redeems himself and tries to make up for his past mistakes.","true":true}
