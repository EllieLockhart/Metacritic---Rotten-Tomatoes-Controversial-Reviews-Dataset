Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The storyline was full of holes\\, and had irrelevant scenes that were only there to make a political point. The old characters continue to be killed off while the new ones suck. The special effects were good\\, but that's about the only redeeming thing about this film. Really disappointed in how they're ruining one of the best sci-fi franchises in film.","true":true}
