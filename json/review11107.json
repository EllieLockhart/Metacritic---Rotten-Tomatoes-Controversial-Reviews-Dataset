Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Highly underwhelming sequel. The sheer amount of plot holes and subplot holes is insane. The tone that was set with \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d was ruined and many questions left unanswered. Next time\\, hire actual writers and continue to build on the story you initially presented.
