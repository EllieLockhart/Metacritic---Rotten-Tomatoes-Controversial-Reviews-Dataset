Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"He literally tossed his saber over his head. Think about how the culmination of VII was Rey epically handing Master Luke his father Anakin's saber... and then VIII happens and we get a damn sitcom laugh track of Luke launching this precious relic over his shoulder irreverently. That scene captures this whole movie. They traded the history\\, character\\, and value of an incredible\\, high-fantasy space opera\\, for a laugh track and Star Wars bed sheets on sale at Target. Such a travesty.","true":true}
