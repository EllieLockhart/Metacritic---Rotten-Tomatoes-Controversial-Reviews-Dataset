Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi did not disappoint.  It provided a tasty blend of new characters and old favorites.  I especially liked the touch of humor reminiscent of early chapters.  There were a couple of plot twists I found unnecessary and a little confusing.  But the major twists were juicy enough to make up for that shortcoming.  I dare any fan of the Saga to not tear up at least once.","true":true}
