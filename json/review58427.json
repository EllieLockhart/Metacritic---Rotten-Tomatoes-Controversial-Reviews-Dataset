Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A great amount of fun and excitement is what this movie is all about. The characters are all pretty well done except for maybe a few on the new ones\\, and the returning ones are much better then in the force awakens.it's very moving because you get to see the resistance in its most dire hour and it's extremely well done because there's high stakes for the most part. The cinematography is absolutely amazing\\, some of the best visuals in any star wars movie. However there are a few plot holes and some questions are raised for many big fans of the saga but it didn't take away from the movie fit the most part. Overall it was very well done and a great addition to the saga. Definitely the best of the new trilogy so far","true":true}
