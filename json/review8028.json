Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fan-boy hate is misguided.  This is a very good movie and honors the legacy of Star Wars.  Listen to the critics this time\\, not the audience.  The audience score is a 2017-internet-troll engineered fraud.  Cinemascore has this as an A.  Enjoy this movie\\, once if not more than once\\, and take every chance you can to yell down to the basement to your favourite fan-boy and tell him how much you loved it.","true":true}
