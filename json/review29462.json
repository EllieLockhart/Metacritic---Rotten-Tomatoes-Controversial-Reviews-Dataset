Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson has for the most part ruined the franchise\\, and above all else shouldn't be handed the reins to the next trilogy.  \\\"(He) broke what could not be broken.

Table set for \\\"character development\\\" success\\, yet he turned it into a sideshow mockery of the original trilogy making Luke Skywalker out to be a total weak-minded bafoon save for a very few scenes like the final projection one.  Rian's take on the franchise would have been far better served by spending more time on the key characters\\, background and Jedi storyline than wasting time on his Hitchcock McGuffin and trivial obsession with breaking away from the past.
