Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a great film and an excellent addition to the Star Wars canon. All of the people complaining about unresolved plot points must be forgetting that this is the second installment in a trilogy... it\u2019s not supposed to wrap everything up nicely. The character arcs were fitting and well executed\\, the themes clear and engaging\\, the cinematography was gorgeous\\, the plot twists were absolutely jaw-dropping\\, and the action was fantastic. Some people are complaining about certain aspects of the force in this movie\\, but would you really want to never see anything new from the force? It would be boring to assume that in seven films we had already seen everything that the force is capable of! Honestly I think that all of the bad reviews are from people who are mad that their ridiculous fan theories didn\u2019t prove to be correct instead of just taking the plot as it was given and passing fair judgement on that. Also people are complaining that it wasn\u2019t enough like the force awakens or the empire strikes back\\, essentially all of the criticism surrounding TFA was that it was too similar to A New Hope! Make up your mind people\\, you can\u2019t have it both ways. This movie was great as a film\\, and everything we could ever want as a Star Wars sequel\\, easily one of my new top 3. ","true":true}
