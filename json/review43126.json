Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This part destroys almost everything we love and replaces it with the characters and stuff we don't really want. Call it obnoxious nostalgia\\, but I see the wonderful story and universe being ruined and demolished for god-knows-why. There is a lot of left propaganda hidden in the film\\, which is bizarre. Star Wars shouldn't turn into another PC machine\\, but it is. Disney also cuts any hope for the same-quality episodes in the future. Kill Han Solo in the previous part? Hell yeah! Other heroes from our childhood in this? Sure\\, why not! And leave us with Rey and some guys that I can hardly remember the next day.","true":true}
