The Last of Us 2 sets out to drive a message deep into the player\\, and my God it delivers.\r\rThat brings me to the recent controversy surrounding this game. As well as it's unjust and unwarranted review bombing. It makes me sick to see so much work\\, and effort being spat on\\, and hated by so many\\, for such a stupid reason. Even if you choose to dislike the title based on one narrative desition made early on in the game. You have to respect the effort\\, and love that Naughty Dog put into their game. So many poured everything they had into this title. To see it being treated like this is incredibly heartbreaking. If you're under the impression that this game is bad\\, based on the influx of negative reviews\\, I just want you to know. The game is wonderful and creates a world just as morbidly beautiful as the original. Do not let these unfounded reviews sway you away from this awesome experience.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
