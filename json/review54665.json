{"101487":138509,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-05-22","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In The Last Jedi Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy managed to disrespect and make ridiculous the characters of Luke and Leia\\, (among others).  At this point\\, there is no reason to watch Episode 9.  Rey is invincible\\, Kylo is weak\\, Maz is uninteresting\\, Finn was almost good if it wasn't for Rose Tico- who is uniquely annoying\\, and Captain Phasma was a road to nowhere.  Furthermore\\, Luke was the most pathetic portrayal of a Jedi ever for most of the movie- then he died.  Supreme Leader Snoke was another road to nowhere- died.  Even the beloved Admiral Ackbar was killed by Rian Johnson- off screen!  What is going on?  Meanwhile\\, Leia also happens to be invincible with silly Mary Poppins Force abilities.  The Force is now a joke.  It literally felt like I was watching a big budget parody of Star Wars.  JJ Abrams now has to figure out how to clean up this mess of a story for Episode 9.  Somehow Disney was so happy with The Last Jedi's performance (due to hype and newer fans who don't care much about the story and characters)\\, that they've actually hired Rian Johnson to direct a new Star Wars trilogy!  If you just can't get enough of characters like Vice Admiral Holdo\\, Rose Tico\\, and DJ and if you like hearing Kathleen's and Rian's personal social justice views in a Star Wars kind of way then you're in for a treat.","true":true}
