Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is an uttter disgrace to everything we love about Star Wars. Disney should make a public apology to fans and sell LucasFilms back to George Lucas for the generous price of $1 so that he can save whatever is left of the Star Wars legacy!","true":true}
