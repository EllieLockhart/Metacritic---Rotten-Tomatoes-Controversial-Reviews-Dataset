Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This episode is daring enough to go where no Star wars film has gone. It has it's own original story not a remix\/copy of previous episodes. Yeah it has things that seems impossible and goes past the laws of physics and previous star wars imagination. But this is Star wars\\, Sci Fi Fantasy that has magic and is in a galaxy far far away. These movies are supposed to have some cheese\\, things for the whole family and test the possibilities of all imagination. This film does exactly that. Those who don't like it just watch the original trilogy over and over and ignore the rest.","true":true}
