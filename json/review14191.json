Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I gave this movie 2 stars only because its part of the Star Wars story.  I completely disagreed with how Luke Skywalker has been portrayed in the film.  The killing of Luke Skywalker was a money grab by Disney so that they can \\\"diversify\\\" from the Skywalker plotline and be \\\"all-inclusive\\\"\\, introducing in future projects whoever they want as part of the Star Wars franchise.  I have no problem with the business side of the Star Wars story but they rushed to finish off Luke\\, Han and the basic family stories we all fell in love with as kids. \\n\\nAll movies have reasons for introducing certain things that really should not be added and are done usually to continue the overall story. However\\, after getting blasted out into the vacuum of space and they suddenly being able to use the force to wake up and pull yourself back onto a ship is a totally farcical fantasy\\, even by fantasy standards.  This is especially true when the character has had no real \\\"force powers\\\" to speak for the entire life of the story.\\n\\nOverall\\, the movie was a total flop and I would not suggest going to the theatre to see it. Wait for the free to watch version online.","true":true}
