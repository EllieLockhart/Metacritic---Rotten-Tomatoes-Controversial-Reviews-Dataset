Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When people say this film makes them want to re-think how bad the Prequels were\\, you know it must be awful.  I saw this in a back-to-back showing with The Force Awakens and although that film has its faults - it really shines in comparison to this muddled effort.  First\\, you really miss an actor with the gratitas of Harrison Ford.  No one seems to step in to fill that voice\\, and those cast members who would have been capable of this are either given cringe dialogue or are got rid off and sit out the rest of the film.  The horrible pro-feminist agenda raises its head full-on\\, which wouldn't be as bad if the plot made any sense - or if there was a lot of genuine thrills and spills around it.  Instead we get a load of hot air surrounded by competent visual and a very underwhelming score by John Williams.  As a fan of Star Wars since I first saw it in 1978 (UK) this is the one that really made me lose interest\\, and feel let down that the good will and expectations raised by The Force Awakens have been squandered and I have been made to feel like it isn't for me anymore.  Well\\, if this is the way it is going then that's fine - it isn't for me\\, but just who is it for?","true":true}
