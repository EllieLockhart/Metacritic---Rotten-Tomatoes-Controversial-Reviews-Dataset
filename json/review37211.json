Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The opening sequence is really good. Some funny banter with Po & Hux and then a well-filmed space battle. That is where the fun stops.\\n\\nThe rest of this movie is just nonsensical garbage! Multiple plot lines don't make any sense (and it would be appear this is so as to accommodate a political statement which I really didn't appreciate)\\, they ruin 2 good villains and the main character of the entire franchise as well as managing to introduce a character that is even more annoying than Jar Jar Binks (who even knew that was possible?! I don't think Rian Johnson (director) understands what fans like about Star Wars and it really shows in this movie!","true":true}
