Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No\\, no\\, no. \\nJust no.\\nHow Disney managed to kill Star Wars in such a comedic fashion is beyond me. Do Not watch this movie if you care about the SW universe\\, or care for such strange things like plot and character development. \\nIf it was a standalone movie\\, without established story\\, it would be kinda ok. But as a SW movie it sucks porgs. Even JJ \\\"the Saviour\\\" Abrams won't repair what Rian \\\"Skywalkerkiller' had done to that movie. Steer clear moviegoers.","true":true}
