Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've got an idea\\, we already have one useless and pointless diversity character in Finn that adds absolutely nothing to the movie\\, so let's add another even more pointless diversity character...  it's this kind of thinking that makes Jar Jar Binks character look like a genius move.  Seriously cut the diversity crap... just put a movie together.  This movie had it's moments\\, the Luke and Rey parts were great\\, but she gets one ridiculous lesson in the force and she is all of a sudden a master of it?  Dumb!  The New Order just had a planet destroyed\\, but are organized enough with large ships to destroy the resistance?  Really?  Leia with no force training\\, gets blown out of a ship\\, without a scratch on her\\, and is able to become super-man and fly her way back into the ship?  Seriously?  Did a 5 year old write the story?  I left the movie thinking... ok... it was ok.  But then the more I think about it\\, the more I absolutely hate the movie.  i wanted this to be a homerun so bad... instead it turned into a money grab piece of junk.... but yeah for diversity... you got that going for you.  Seriously\\,  it's worth watching... but not for the theater ticket price.","true":true}
