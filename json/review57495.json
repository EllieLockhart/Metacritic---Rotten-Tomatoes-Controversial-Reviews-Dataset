Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This rating should be higher but i can't get by the destruction and disrespect from the writers\\, directors\\, and Disney.\\n\\nHOW IN THE HELL DOES NICKELODEON NAIL A STRONG FEMALE CHARACTER IN \\\"THE LEGEND OF KORRA\\\" AND DISNEY DOESN'T?\\n\\nI love the building of strong female characters\\, but like many other failed films before it\\, Star Wars failed on one HUGE aspect of doing that. You can't make strong female characters by making the males in the film weaker.\\n\\nLet's not get into plot holes\\, or the casino planet\\, or the forced (Thor Ragnarok esc comedy)\\, or the forced messaging. For a 200+ million dollar movie you should be able to get messaging across without punching us with it in the face.\\n\\nBreaking the hearts of many dedicated fans seeing a beloved universe blatantly and lazily disrespected. I realize that from a critical perspective the movie has few flaws\\, but most critical reviews involve themes and delivery. If these qualities were important to Star Wars then we would have lost all of our fans when the prequels came out. Plot\\, story telling\\, and character development is what makes Star Wars so great. This film misses on all three.","true":true}
