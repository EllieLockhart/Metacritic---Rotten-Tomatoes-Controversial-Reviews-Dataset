Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nice visuals\\, effects and action but far too many plot holes drag the movie experience down for me. The Force Awakens was a lot better even though it basically just copied the New Hope format\\, simply because the plot was consistent and felt (somewhat) meaningful unlike The Last Jedi.","true":true}
