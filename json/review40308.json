Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is one of the best Star Wars films ever made. It breaks the mold while staying true to George Lucas's world. Rian johnson is an outstanding filmmaker and writer. Adam Driver\\, Mark Hamil\\, Carrie Fischer\\, and Daisy Ridley are amazing. Everything about this film takes Star Wars to a new level and sets up a stage fire Star Wars to continue for generations to come. Don't listen to the 19 salty fanboys who are just angry we didn't get a repeat of the original saga and so they spend hours a day down voting the reviews of this film. Watch it.","true":true}
