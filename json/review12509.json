Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can see why Mark Hamil was disappointed when he read the script\\, this is not how Luke Skywalker would be!This film is an utter disappointment on so many levels\\, they have destroyed the franchise that all of us have grown up with. Trying to make it like a Guardians of the galaxy film is so so wrong\\, Character development is poor the film just doesn't go anywhere. i could go on and on! What have you done Disney!!","true":true}
