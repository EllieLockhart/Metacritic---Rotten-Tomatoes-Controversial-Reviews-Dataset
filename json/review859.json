Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Angry fans are so wrong. I have been a Star Wars lover for 40 years now. Thanks to Rian Johnson\\, I felt like I was 7 again.\\nThe action\\, the twists! What an entertainment! The film is very dense and extremely smart. You have to watch it again and again to understand how much Rian Jonhson has weighed every decision he made with the story. The characters finally become interesting\\, deep and true (Rian Johnson obviously leads the actors better than JJ Abrams\\, for whom I have the greatest respect though).\\nThe beauty of certain scenes\\, including the heroic gesture of Holdo and the Battle of Crait\\, by far exceeds anything we have seen in the previous episodes.\\nCan't wait for the DVD\\, well iTunes actually.","true":true}
