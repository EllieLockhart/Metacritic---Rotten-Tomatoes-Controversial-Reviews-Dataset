Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie ever Marketing misled audience that something huge would be revealed and it never happened. Midway through the the most useless subplot ever written began resulting in nothing. Thus subplot had no bearing on the films full plot as a whole. \\nIt was convuluted and at times ridiculous. Awkward dialogue and Fisher was completly misused. Hamills character was basically assassinated. Do not see this movie.","true":true}
