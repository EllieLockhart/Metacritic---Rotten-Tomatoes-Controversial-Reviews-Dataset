Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All I can say it is definitely strange that it has a 91% rating on the tomatometer. This was not a good movie. It was absurd and made a mockery of everything before it. I loved star wars growing up. I will not watch another movie made by this regime.","true":true}
