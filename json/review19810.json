Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Star Wars franchise\\, for the past 35 years\\, has been fueled almost exclusively on the nostalgic goodwill of the three original films. These films were exceptional. They are almost-universally loved. So much so that despite the bad taste left by the prequels\\, fans were ready to give Disney the benefit of the doubt when they acquired the property for $4 billion in 2012. Despite The Force Awakens being a largely hollow\\, mystery box experience\\, fans gave it too the benefit of the doubt that it was a narrative springboard to reveals and context in the next chapter. \\n\\nNot so. \\n\\nDirector Rian Johnson was apparently given carte blanche with his project\\, even as Lucasfilm fired one director after another off other Star Wars projects for failing to align with their creative direction. For a company that set stringent rails up for their movies\\, Johnson was surprisingly free to become a rogue agent\\, and it shows.\\n\\nJohnson's film plays more like a bad improv game of freeze coming off the events of Force Awakens. The film seems to relish in playing for subversive laughs rather than building on the events of the previous film. In addition to a complete lack of interest toward The Force Awakens' still-hanging story threads\\, The Last Jedi also spends its bloated 3-hour running time with protracted side plots that go nowhere\\, immense logic problems that break the rules of the Star Wars mythos in staggeringly nonsensical ways\\, and delights in the literal destruction of the classic Star Wars saga. \\n\\nFor a company that paid $4 billion for a franchise loved for its past\\, Disney is making the very unwise move of destroying that past rather than merging into it - which can be done\\, they just choose not to. As a result\\, Luke Skywalker is besmirched and wasted\\, while Princess Leia is treated like an inconvenient prop. All without the context to get the audience there properly - just like the previous entry. \\n\\nAbrams admitted on The Force Awakens he was wanting to set up questions that the next director would answer. What he didn't anticipate was a director who refused to play the mystery box game. Johnson is truly a rogue director and all evidence points to his contempt for this franchise. A very unwise move on Disney's part to allow for such extreme experimentation within the saga films. Experimentation would have been better-placed in the standalone films like Rogue One\\, but reportedly Rogue One and Han Solo both attempted to experiment\\, and their respective directors were pushed aside so the films could fall into a more vanilla spectrum. \\n\\nAt the end of the day\\, The Last Jedi is the worst Star Wars film of all time. Disrespectful of what came before it\\, aimless in the events within it\\, and unconcerned with the story that must come after it. The characters do not grow\\, the dramatic stage it operates in (all-powerful First Order vs. now-tiny Resistance) is implausible\\, and never given enough explanation to allow it any credibility with the viewer.\\n\\nJohnson has achieved one previously-thought-impossible feat however - He's made the first Star Wars film that's so awful\\, it's destroyed many fans' interest in seeing future Star Wars movies. \\n\\nOh\\, and that includes myself. So long\\, Star Wars. They say the mighty fall hard. Well\\, this was the most mighty film franchise ever\\, but as with Rome\\, Lucasfilm might not think they're in any danger\\, but trust me\\, the barbarians will be at the gate sooner than you think...","true":true}
