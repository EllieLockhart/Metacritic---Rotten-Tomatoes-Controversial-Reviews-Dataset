Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like Kylo said kill the past... this movie was amazing broke all expectations I had for a Star Wars movie. This allowed the characters from the OT to be important but also allowed for the next generation to come into its own","true":true}
