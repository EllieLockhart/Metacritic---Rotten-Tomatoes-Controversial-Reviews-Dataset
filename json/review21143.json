Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was thoroughly entertained. There are a lot of people out there who love to hate on Star Wars or who build up their expectations so high that it can only be disappointing\\, but that\u2019s not me. I was entertained and that\u2019s why I watch movies.","true":true}
