Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many eye rolling moments.  This is a foolish movie where the whole Jedi order and its history is rejected and a young person has all Jedi power without training.  Heroic actions are rebuked and condemned and retreat is glorified.  Defeating the Empire is the goal\\, but they seem happy to run away as a little band of losers.","true":true}
