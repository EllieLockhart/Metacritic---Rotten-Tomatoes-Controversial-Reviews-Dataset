Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a huge Star Wars fan\\, but The Last Jedi tried too hard to be likable and funny for a much darker film. A plot in which neither the rebellion nor the empire accomplished anything and leaves nothing to be excited for in the next film.","true":true}
