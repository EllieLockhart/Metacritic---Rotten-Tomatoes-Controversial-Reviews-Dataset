Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a totally bad movie\\, but not a great one either. Too many plot lines that go nowhere\\, too many twists that retwist\\, an angry Luke Skywalker (which basically leads you to believe that Kylo can never be a Jedi)\\, Leia using the force in a way we've never seen\\, and she's alive at the end which means that since she won't be in IX that she dies somehow off camera. I understand that they're passing the torch\\, but not sure it's in a good way.","true":true}
