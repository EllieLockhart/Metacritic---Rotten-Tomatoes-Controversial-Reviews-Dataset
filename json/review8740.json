{"101487":121624,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-23","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For all those \\\"true fans\\\" who claim this movie sucks titty-balls\\, by definition you are not a true fan.  If you were a true fan\\, you would be watching this simply because its star wars\\, and not because leads who are not associated with your ideals are taking the helm.  You would be watching with bated breath if Princess Leia was going to die and hoping for a miracle.  You would be shaking your head\\, thinking \\\"Oh shit\\, oh shit\\, is she going to take this hand?  Are the jedi forever gone?\\\"  You would be watching the BB-9E going up the elevator with a interanlly preconceived \\\"I have a bad feeling about this.\\\"  But nooo... you are pissy because there is a girl lead with deep connections to the force as well as with the people around her.  You post evidence that she is much not needed Mary Sue when HELLO? There have already been two on this franchise and apparently you never noticed them (Anakin and Luke - dumb-dumbs) .  You are pissed that the cast's fate is in the hands and bravery of your \\\"new jar-jarbinks\\\" (*bitch slaps you- Finn is better than you'll ever be) and the best part? You waste your time and engird trying to tear apart the movie that has given millions of little girls hope and new purpose with the arrival of our new hero. Updating and supplementing the old kitch of the original star wars with new struggles and beautifully fought characters.  Simply put: the protagonists are not \\\"white males\\\" ... wait for it *double bitch slap* which makes you go crying to daddy\\, who goes crying to his racist daddy who doesn't even give a shit about star wars util you mention female\/black protagonist and he goes\\, and he still doesn't care.  Also\\, did you know that the original Star Wars was inspired by a Japanese director named Akira Kurosawa?  (his work is even being riffed in this film\\, its called Rashomon\\, a story of point of view\\, demonstrated between the different accounts of why Ren left the academy)  Furthermore\\, the story's formula was taken by a movie with a girl protagonist (Wizard of Oz).  It was never your movie to save and its not yours to defend\\, or rather\\, rip to shreds.   It belongs to everyone\\, so let other people enjoy and be led into this film and the films to come.   Because we know there are about sixty people (max) here who are just deleting their accounts and creating new ones with nothing better to do.  I'm not saying the movie doesn't have its faults\\, but let the people who see actual faults with the movies state their claim without you throwing in your nonsense because it is clear that they are smarter than you! I would like to hear from those people\\, and would like rotten tomatoes to put harder grips of those allowed to sign up\\, because wasting time and effort on something like this is a stupid\\, hateful and unmanly thing to do with your time.","true":true}
