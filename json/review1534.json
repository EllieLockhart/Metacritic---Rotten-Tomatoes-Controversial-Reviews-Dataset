Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lifelong fan of the franchise I had to take a step back after my first viewing. It wasn't at all what I had come to expect from a Star Wars film and I wasn't sure at all how I felt about it. Upon a second viewing however I was able to see how this film brought new life to the franchise. As fans we shouldn't be mad that our fan theories or expectations aren't satisfied. We should be excited that like the original trilogy we are finally left guessing what is to come next. It wasn't a perfect film but it was an excellent addition to the franchise.","true":true}
