Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My main issue with TLJ is that is takes all the questions TFA wanted you to ask and theorize to keep the hype up for Star Wars alive for two years between movies and basically tell you that those questions don't matter. I get you want to stay fresh and keep people guessing\\, but this was an absolute mess. The twists in this movie will never compare to Empire. I wish they wouldn't have teased Rey's parents or have introduced Snoke. I'm also a little confused how Disney wouldn't have had a basic outline for this trilogy. How do they expect any cohesiveness between writers and directors or to the story? Rian Johnson basically took everything JJ did in the TFA and threw it out the window. What are we to expect now from Episode IX....another jumbled mess...another story trying to be made up as they go. I know creatives need to tell a story but at least George Lucas had a narrative in mind...and end goal...timeline of a story he wanted to tell. I appreciated the visuals of the movie and the fact that this hardcore fan got to see these characters on screen again\\, but very disappointed with the story and where it was left off. I really hope Episode IX can redeem this trilogy.","true":true}
