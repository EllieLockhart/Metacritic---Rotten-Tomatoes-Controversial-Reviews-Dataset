Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely TERRIBLE.  It was fabulous if your into a Mary Sue protagonist\\, a token black guy\\, a new token female Asian\\, and male bashing female characters having all the answers and upper hand in every situation. A total SJW crap fest from ultra liberal Disney. Completely destroyed what Lukes character has done and meant to the franchise\\, reducing him to some deranged crazy cat lady that wanted to kill his nephew in his sleep rather then see him turn to the dark side\\, even though we know Luke would have given his own life to SAVE him from succumbing to it. Total disappointment and disservice to a once great franchise.","true":true}
