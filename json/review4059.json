Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Breath of fresh air in the Skywalker Saga. The changes are nice and it's not a copy of Empire Strikes back. New characters\\, new lore\\, new planets are a nice welcome for future spin offs. Light comedy and not forced. Old characters touch on looking forward. Form your own opinions don't follow trends.","true":true}
