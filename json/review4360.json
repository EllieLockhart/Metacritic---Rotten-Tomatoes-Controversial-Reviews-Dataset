Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Can't quite fathom why so many people have had such a negative reaction to this wonderful movie!? I've been a huge SW fan since the 80s. The Last Jedi was beautifully shot and directed - with an obvious love and respect for the Original Trilogy. The slapstick humor is sometimes a bit much\\, but seriously people - IT'S A MOVIE - it's ok to have a laugh. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren is amazing.","true":true}
