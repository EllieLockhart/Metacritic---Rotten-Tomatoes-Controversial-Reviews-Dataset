Gameplay is similar to the first one\\, not bad\\, but not the best.The story however is a revenge plot that is extremely poorly executed. They completely ripped apart everything that the first game had built up and definitely did not do right by Joel and Ellie as they said they were going to. Joel gets killed very early in a very dumb way and Ellie loses everything. The new characters are not fleshed out enough and most are forgettable. You play as Abby for half the game and I found her very unlikeable even as they show her past to get you to sympathize with her. The ten hours of gameplay with her just seemed to drag on.  I found the flashbacks of Joel and Ellie to be the best part of the game and I really enjoyed them\\, but unfortunately those were short and few.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
