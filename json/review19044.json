Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It\u2019s far too long of course but with a strong script\\, solid characterisation and superb acting this is indeed the best Star Wars film since Empire Strikes Back. Carrie Fisher rightly has standout moments where she steals the whole film\\, but pretty much everyone impresses\\, including the very surprising addition of Laura Dern. I feel conflicted about where the film ends up but there\u2019s so much I like\\, from a vastly improved Adam Driver to writer-director Rian Johnson\u2019s whole approach to the Jedi\/Smith\/Force mythos that I could watch this many times over.
