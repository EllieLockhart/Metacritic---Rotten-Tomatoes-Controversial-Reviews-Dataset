Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just made an account because of how disappointing this movie is.  Entire plotlines are rendered irrelevant over the course of the movie.  A major villain is killed off before even getting a backstory in a horrible anti-climax.  Characters we love like Luke act completely unlike themselves and I just don't see where they go from here.  I don't think a movie has ever disappointed me more.  And this is my honest opinion.  Just because someone doesn't like this movie doesn't make him or her a \\\"white supremacist\\\" or a \\\"misogynist\\\" as Wired wrote.","true":true}
