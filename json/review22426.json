Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Left me not caring if I see the next film or not. How could they let this out the door? So much squandered. Strange plot choices.  If I had read the poor reviews\\, I wouldn't have believed them. You have to see it to understand how poorly this was executed.    I can't believe this film inspired me to write a review on the internet.","true":true}
