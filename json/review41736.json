Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie isn't going to be for everyone\\, especially people who had major head canons going into this. I loved the experience. This movie was way more introspective and dark for a Star Wars movie\\, but still keeps that Star Was theme of hope running throughout\\, even when things seem bleak. Also\\, it was beautiful. And sometimes silly\\, because it's Star Wars.\\n\\nThis is not science fiction\\, it's fantasy in space\\, so leave your expectations at the door\\, because this movie isn't wish fulfillment\\, nor should it be. It's telling the midpoint of a story\\, which is going to be the darkest point in any series\\, so naturally it doesn't resolve every issue (and it never should\\, does anyone actually remember how ESB ends?).\\n\\nEven as someone who really enjoyed TFA\\, this movie felt very different and there was definitely more to pick at\\, character-wise\\, which was great. But I don't think it's going to change any minds\\, but some people like to make up their opinions before actually seeing a movie. Don't let other people's perceptions color your own. \\n\\nSee it twice. This movie has some amazing shots that are worth seeing in the theater for a second time (when reactions aren't so knee-jerk).\\n\\nI loved the experience\\, the creatures\\, the silliness\\, the introspection\\, the darkness. It was a lovely experience that reminded me of some of the content from KotoR\\, which was thrilling to me as a fan. Rian did a great job here; the writing is fun and snappy and he pushes the characters beyond what I'd come to expect from them\\, which was great to see. Highly recommended.","true":true}
