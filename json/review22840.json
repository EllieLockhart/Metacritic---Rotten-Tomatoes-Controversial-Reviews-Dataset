Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Long\\, Bad Jokes\\, lots of filler\\, bad direction\\, more plot holes\\, kills one of the most iconic characters from the original Trilogy much like they did in the Force Awakens and needlessly at that\\, and felt disconnected from the original franchise I mean even the prequels felt authentic even though they weren't the greatest either but superior to the Last Jedi. RIP Carrie Fisher\\, we all miss you! I hope they do you justice in 9.","true":true}
