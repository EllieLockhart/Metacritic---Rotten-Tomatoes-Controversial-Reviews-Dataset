Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I feel that this movie shit over my entire childhood.\\n\\nThe director must be schizophrenic because this movie was.\\n\\nI thin the director must be struck by arrested development and is mentally stuck at the age of fourteen\\, only a fourteen year old would enjoy the pointless one-lines and over use of CGI in this film.\\n\\nDisney must have hired people who 'didn't get' start wars as a kid and now want to ruin it for everyone who did. \\n\\nDisney could have gotten a movie equally as good by by employing film students and having them film the entire movie with their smart phones.\\n\\nI don't understand why Disney wouldn't just use one of the hundred amazing star wars novels written by popular and successful authors as the basis for their movies instead of coming up with this half-assed movie storyline.\\n\\nI love how they build mystery around Snoke and then kill him randomly in this film.\\n\\nIts like the writer has an infantile sense of morality\\, he has one of the character says \\\"We won't win this war by killing those we hate only by saving those we love\\\" as thousands of rebels are killed by a first order laser cannon.\\n\\nIt's like they don't 'get' star wars.","true":true}
