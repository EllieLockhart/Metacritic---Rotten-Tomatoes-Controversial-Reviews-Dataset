Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Three words description: Dissapointing. Dumbstrucking. Nonsensical. \\nToo many ideas for one movie results in a catastrophial series of scenes wich take no adequate time to explain anything or let any emotions or scenes or actions sink in. Jokes fall flat because they feel out of place\\, dramatic scenes are ridiculous because there is no prober build up\\, the \\\"characters\\\" akt weird. Deus ex machina saves the protatonists all the time.\\n\\nThe plus: Good graphics. But which big film doesn't have these? And good soundtrack?? I don't remember anymore!\\n\\nMy recommendation: Drink one or two beers beforehand and watch the film as \\\"so bad its good\\\"\\, preferably on DvD. \\n\\nDone with the disney star wars.","true":true}
