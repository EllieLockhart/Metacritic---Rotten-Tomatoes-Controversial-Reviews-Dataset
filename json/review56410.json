Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The action was great as usual\\, but the \\\"risks\\\" Rian said he was taking with the plot were not refreshing.  Basically erasing the mystery of TFA and making some of the most interesting characters from it basically pointless really left a bad taste in my mouth.  Lots of pointless plot and don't get me started on the space walk scene.  I didn't feel it honored my favorite character in the original trilogy in the slightest and took a very poorly done plot to off that character.  Plot seemed unnecessary and rather pointless for most of it outside of Rey and Kylo.  Driver did a much better job this time and I didn't mind Kylo as much.  Daisy did a great job.  Very very disappointed with the new direction of the franchise.","true":true}
