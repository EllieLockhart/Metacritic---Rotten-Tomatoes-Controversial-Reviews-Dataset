Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really liked this movies besides the finn and rose side-plot. Other than that I thought it was really good. I thought the bond formed between kylo ren and rey was well done. I also thought the change in him at the end was done really well. I just really didn't like the stupid casino world adventure. Too much going on.","true":true}
