Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney continue to merge old characters and new. But killing off the old characters and making way for the new generation feels like cinematic euthanasia! The pacing of the movie is unbalanced. Some characters leave us without being fully developed - were they just merchandizing opportunities to begin with? Ultimately this episode lacks the fluidity of Episode 7 but contains quite a few twists and turns that make it impossible to predict what will happen next and becomes an intriguing view from that standpoint. It's clear we have entered into a new era of Star Wars with new\\, often vibrant characters leading the way. It is unclear what direction Episode 9 will go in and ultimately that is testament to the unique approach to storytelling that encapsulated Episode 8.","true":true}
