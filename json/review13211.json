Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't understand all the bad press for this movie. It's true that this was not a typical Star Wars movie. Why is that such a big deal? The prequels were typical Star Wars movies\\, and look how that turned out. This movie had everything a good Star Wars movie should have. Space battles\\, force powers\\, lightsabers\\, and the Millennium Falcon. What else is there?","true":true}
