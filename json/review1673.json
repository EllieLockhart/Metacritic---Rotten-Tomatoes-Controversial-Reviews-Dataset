Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As an absolute fanatic of the original trilogy and the original canon books\\, I have to say this is by far my favorite movie since Return of the Jedi. The humor was fantastic\\, the action intense\\, and it pulled at every heart string imaginable and left me a blubbering mess. I've been back 3 times and plan on going a few more times before it leaves theaters. 10\/10 would go again.\\nAnd again.\\nAnd again.","true":true}
