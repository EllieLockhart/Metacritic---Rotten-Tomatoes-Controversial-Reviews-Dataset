Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a huge Star Wars fan and feel very upset after watching this movie. I really wish this film isn't canon and not called Episode 8. Doesnt even feel like a Star Wars movie.\\n\\nA movie that just try new things and surprises people with  pretty questionable decision makings in the movie  - does not make it a good movie!\\n\\nDont be misled by the 92% critics review on Rotten Tomatoes. There is a reason it has like 52% audience score on RT...and it dropped about 69% on its 2nd weekend...most fans do not wish to watch thie movie a second time! And that includes me.\\n\\nNot very enthusiastic about Episode 9 now....","true":true}
