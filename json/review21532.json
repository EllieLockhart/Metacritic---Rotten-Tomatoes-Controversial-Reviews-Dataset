Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would say I enjoyed this movie\\, but The Ldt Jedi isn't without its faults. With some subplots that do little to advance the plot\\, they fall flat.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi takes considerable risk in its storyline\\, some of which are up for debate between the fans\\, and it seems that most fans disagree with the choices made by Rian Johnson. With a major backlash like this from the fanbase it is assured that we most likely won't see many risks taken again. In the future\\, fans will be settling for sub-par space entertainment because the studio is afraid to take the story where they want it to go. The release is the darkest day in the star wars franchise\\, not because of the movie\\, but because of us.","true":true}
