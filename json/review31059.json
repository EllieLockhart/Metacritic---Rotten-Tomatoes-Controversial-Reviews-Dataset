Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So I finally watched this movie again since opening night. Well\\, I didn't like it then and I still don't like it now. Much has been said about all the terrible writing and plot holes and I thoroughly agree. Just a bad movie.\\n\\nNow before someone starts calling me a \\\"butthurt fanboy\\\"\\, I want to make this simple argument. Star Wars movies have a theme\\, a vibe\\, a look\\, a story\\, etc. that is very particular to the series. THink Harry Potter\\, Indiana Jones\\, Bond\\, etc. You expect a Bond film to be a Bond film. Once you mess with the formula\\, it ceases to be a true Bond film.\\n\\nThat is what I though about the Last Jedi. It just wasn't a Start Wars film\\, and I think the director has been justifiably called out for it. \\n\\nSolo was the first Star Wars film I haven't seen on opening night and I'm feeling a bit bad about it\\, but I lay the blame on TLJ. Disney needs to back off a little\\, let the movies become more of an \\\"event\\\". Here's hoping #9 get's the mojo back.","true":true}
