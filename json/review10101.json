Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great movie\\, as an original viewer of the series growing up I can appreciate the new ideas\\, new characters and storylines. Everything I wanted to see in a Star Wars movie\\, great battles\\, epic one on one lightsaber action\\, plot twists and great energy. Go see it and enjoy!","true":true}
