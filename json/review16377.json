Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm pretty sad at how bad this movie was. I love all the cast\\, but this whole movie was a mess and killed the amazing build up that Force Awakens created. I'm still going to see Episode IX but I might wait until its out of the theatre. This was not the Star Wars experience I was looking for.","true":true}
