Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you were hoping to see a continuation of the Star Wars universe\\, you will sadly be left disappointed. This film wears the face of the Star Wars franchise\\, but I can assure you that it is not. Familiar characters\\, places and themes will be used to get you invested into the story only to be wiped away by its end. This film does not care about the original trilogy or even the Force Awakens. It is focused solely on wiping away everything that you originally loved about the series and shoehorning some clumsy story that makes no sense. To be honest\\, it's like one of the Scholastic books you used to buy at book fairs in elementary school. It's just a half-baked romp in a universe it seems the director had only the slightest knowledge of. While the movie itself is eye candy with absolutely stunning visual affects\\, that's about all it offers. The next film absolutely has no room to work with (due to them literally wiping out everything) and personally\\, I dread what garbled nonsense they'll put out next.","true":true}
