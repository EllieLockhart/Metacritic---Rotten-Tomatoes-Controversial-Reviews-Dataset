Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a bad movie\\, from princess leia doing a mary poppins act\\, to the slowest high speed chase ever\\, and a time line that just doesnt match up. Rian Johnson has ruined our favorite Star Wars characters and managed to make me not care about any of the new ones. Way too much comic relief right when the tension in the scene is getting good\\, and it ruined the immersion. It felt like two movies happening at once. One about the Jedi that left a lot unexplained and another about the rebels\\, both leaving a lot to be desired. There were a lot of scenes that felt forced or could have been left out together especially fin's weird side quest that had no point. There were too many cute things in movie that were totally unnecessary. This was a terrible treatment of Star Wars and its Mythos. I would rather watch prequel trilogy than this new series\\, at leas it had an original story instead of taking way to much from the original trilogy. If you want to watch this movie you already have if you've watched empire strikes back.","true":true}
