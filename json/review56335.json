Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Take everything you love about star wars\\, then chuck it out the window with this movie. Oh\\, you like Luke and his never give up attitude? Too bad\\, he is a grumpy old man that gave up on everyone and goes out like a pussy. Do you like all the mysteries set up by the last movie? None of it matters and you just need to forget about it. It feels like the two directors\/writers were playing ping pong with the plot and we all are suffering. I enjoyed the prequels more because even with their cheesy writing and bad acting\\, they had a decent plot and stayed true to the characters.","true":true}
