Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very enjoyable Star Wars movie. Not quite as well rounded of a film as The Force Awakens but it was very well done. The Last Jedi has one of the greatest soundtracks you will ever hear\\, impeccable CGI\\, some of the coolest scenes you can see in a movie\\, and some outstanding performances. The movie takes a hit with some bad acting from a couple smaller and one big character\\, some weak dialogue\\, and some awkwardly edited\/shot scenes but it doesn't slow down the movie enough to not make it extremely enjoyable. Isaac\\, Boyega\\, Ridley\\, and Hamill all give great performances but are outshined by Driver who gives possibly the best performance of any actor to ever be in a Star Wars movie. Overall great movie.","true":true}
