Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the most God awful excuse of a star wars film\\, I never thought in my life I would hate a SW film\\, but Disney once again you have proven me wrong!  How abought answering questions you made all of us ask in ep7. Why can there not be a man her I instead of Rey? She's horrible! The stupid casino planet\\, omg that was the last straw\\, it was pointless. It's like that whole mission was just filler for the move.  Please stop fucking up star wars! You are killing my childhood. And why\\, why\\, why\\, have you made like such a freaking weirdo? Let some of your diehard fans make these movies. Most would probably do it for no money\\, or at very little a spot in the movie. This director sucks\\, fire him.","true":true}
