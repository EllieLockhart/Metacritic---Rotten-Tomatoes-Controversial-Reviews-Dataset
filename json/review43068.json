Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This one's Garbage! Critics reviews said it was emotional. It was\\, in a way never expected. It killed the beloved Star Wars I knew & loved from childhood. Took no consideration of the unanswered questions from A Force Awakens that was most looking forward to finding out. The plot was so full of holes\\, one wonders if there was a script at all.","true":true}
