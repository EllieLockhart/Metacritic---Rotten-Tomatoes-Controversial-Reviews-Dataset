Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointed in how they are treating George Lucas property. The whole plot of chasing the Resistance until they run out of gas? Seriously people? Finn and Rose just waltz to a casino while everyone is staying on the ship waiting to die. seriously? Poe says go look for this guy and bring him back is so lame its hard to believe its a real plot. Luke was cheated out of a big awesome lightsaber fight. Leia turns into Mary Poppins in space. I could go on and on but whats the use. They ruined Star Wars.","true":true}
