Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You have to hand it to Rian Johnson. He\u2019s a brave\\, brave man to take Star Wars in such a different direction. There\u2019s a lot to process here\\, which is why I\u2019m reserving a full five stars. Rey\u2019s parents being nobody. That works for me. Everyone who\u2019s everyone in Star Wars doesn\u2019t have to come from someone significant? Rey is great on her own\\, as she\u2019s always been\\, and I think there\u2019s some poignant significance to that. Snoke unanswered questions don\u2019t bother me either. We\u2019ll likely find out someday\\, but this movie\u2019s focus is more interesting when it\u2019s centered around the conflict Rey and Kylo are having with their respective mentors. Where Snoke comes from honestly doesn\u2019t concern me. I think this will be more appreciated on repeat watches. I know I missed some fun details foreshadowing Luke\u2019s Force projection because I was so caught up in the moment. Sure\\, the humor falls more often than not\\, and SuperLeia was just awful. But I would\u2019ve been a helluva lot more upset if Leia died and we didn\u2019t get a moment between her and Luke\\, even if Luke technically wasn\u2019t \u201cthere.\u201d First thing I said walking out of the theater was \u201cthis sure is going to be a polarizing film for fans.\u201d But if you complained that TFA was \u201ctoo similar\u201d to the originals\\, you absolutely cannot complain that TLJ is \u201ctoo different.\u201d Some people just can\u2019t be pleased.
