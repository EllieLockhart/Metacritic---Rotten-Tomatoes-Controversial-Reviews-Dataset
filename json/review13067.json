Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know if this is true or not but\\, I gave this film one star because I read that if you didn't give it at least that\\, it wouldn't count.  The truth is\\, if I could give this movie zero star(s) I would.\\n\\nI'm one of the original fans of Star Wars (I saw A New Hope in the theaters when I was 6) and would take just about anything that was served to me simply because I love Star Wars so much.  However\\, when I left the theater it felt like the movie was a big \\\"F.U.\\\" to me as someone who liked the original (pre-Lucas selling) Star Wars or cared for the original characters.  It seemed like whoever is running Star Wars currently views the original cast as more of an obstacle than something to incorporate into the movie.  Then I learned that there was no over-arcing story to encompass the 3 films.  That is is just being handled on a movie by movie basis with very little continuity between them.  And\\, that is exactly how this movie felt.  I was interested to see where things were going with Snoke\\, Ray\\, Poe and of course Luke since it left us hanging with the lightsaber hand-off from The Force Awakens.  But\\, that was all thrown out for\\, what appeared to be\\, a very poorly thought out \\\"story\\\" (and I use that term loosely).  For a movie that occupied 2 1\/2 hours\\, nothing was explained\\, the plot was not furthered\\, and in the end\\, any excitement for the next film was snuffed out.  Every thread of interest from The Force Awaken was resolved very anticlimactically\\, the character of Luke was handled in the most egregious manner.  That\\, I found the most surprising and disappointing since the character of Luke has always been the most popular character in the franchise.  After watching this movie\\, I don't know where it's going but\\, what's the sad truth of the matter is\\, I don't care.\\n\\nIf this hodge-podge manner of storytelling is what can be expected  for further installments of these \\\"trilogies\\\" (a misnomer if ever there was one) then I doubt very seriously I'll be partaking in anymore of Star Wars.","true":true}
