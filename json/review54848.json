Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It looks like we gave up on making real movies and switched to political propaganda pieces. Let's include people of all the ethnicity and genders (all 59k of them) and let's make them all \\\"heroes\\\". But most importantly\\, let's make the women good and strong and the men evil\\, weak and stupid -- and contradict ourselves. Because that's what makes a movie great. And let's forget about good actors and a good story. Let's add the SJW-Liberal crap because movies have to include the BS we deal with on Earth\\, in real life\\, even in fake galaxies far far away. I'm done with Hollywood.","true":true}
