Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I confess I felt strongly enough about this film to make an account.  This movie had some of the highest highs of any Star Wars film\\, which earns it two stars.  \\n\\nThe missing 3 are for the combined disappointments of poor narrative flow\\, tone that is more consistent with a Marvel film than a Star Wars film\\, and a screenplay that was too dependent on a few Big Moments and not enough focused on bringing impact and weight to every individual moment.\\n\\nPlease note that I have said nothing about what was done with the characters of Skywalker or Snoke.  Though I did not enjoy their handling\\, I do not think they affected the quality of the movie overall the way that the screenplay and direction did.  I do personally believe the movie did irreparable damage to Luke Skywalker in the greater arc of the Star Wars story\\, but I respect the rights of other fans\\, and\\, ya know\\, the DIRECTOR\\, to disagree with me.\\n\\nStill\\, this difference of opinion should not save the movie from its troubled script\\, poor narrative flow\\, and lazy screenplay.  I cannot stress enough\\, that is the reason for the 2 stars\\, not their handling of Skywalker.","true":true}
