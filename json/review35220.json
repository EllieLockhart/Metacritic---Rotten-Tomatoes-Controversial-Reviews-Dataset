Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The franchise was built on\\, and the first seven movies centered around Luke and Anikan Skywalker.  Now. RIAN JOHNSON feels the need to reboot the franchise and focus on a nobody?   To take the most noble attribute of a Jedi \\\"never give up\\\" and make the most powerful Jedi ever\\, quit.  To ignore the Force Awakens setups\\, the knights of Ren\\, Rey's force vision\\, the galactic search for Luke\\, the build up of Rey's parents just show Rian is not a fan and  his selfish desire to just make a stand as alone movie severely tarnishing the lore established by 7 previous films.  Shame on you Disney for letting this happen!!!","true":true}
