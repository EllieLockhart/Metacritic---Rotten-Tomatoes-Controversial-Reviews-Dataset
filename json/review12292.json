Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am rating the movie as a whole\\, not just the visuals. It brakes everything Star Wars and not for the better. Story is very poor with some action here and there. Only Kylo has character development and not much. All the men are usless or reckless while all the women are far superior seems to be the main message. In the original trilogy Lucas just had men and women equal all the time. Lukes legacy is now a farce and he is the worst jedi ever. Actually he just gives up on being a jedi altogether. Supposedly it makes him human. But in reality they just did not know what to do with him. And in order to not have Luke overshadow the movie and once again become about him\\, they made him pathetic and killed him in a pathetic way. Director was far out of his depth and the end script shows. Visuals are good and thats why I gave it 1\/2 star. First Star Wars movie I have no plans on watching and first time I have no interest in watching the next installment. Star Wars went from amazing to just another movie made by another guy. A life long fan who loves everything Star Wars was bored during the movie!","true":true}
