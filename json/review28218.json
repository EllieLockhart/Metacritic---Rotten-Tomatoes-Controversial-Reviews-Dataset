Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poorly written. Character development of Luke is flimsy and undeserved. Leia scene (you know which) is utterly ridiculous. Not a single lightsaber on lightsaber clash. Not once does a lightsaber touch another. Snoke is dumb. They picked the dumbest possible way to handle him. Movie is forgettable and can be explained in about 30 seconds to someone if they were to skip it. The end of the movie has made next to no progress over the beginning. Vile excuse for a star wars film.","true":true}
