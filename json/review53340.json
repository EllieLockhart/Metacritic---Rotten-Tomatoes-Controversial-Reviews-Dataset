Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Definitely a gorgeous movie to look at\\, which is why is receives a 1\/2 star because quality visuals are helpful to a film.  I had thought that the series had immense hope to become something quite great with a little polish on the rough areas of Episode 7\\, but I was quite wrong indeed it would appear.  \\n\\nI honestly don't know if Episode 1 or Episode 8 of Star Wars is worse\\, after seeing the latest\\, but they both really are quite dreadful.  Episode 1 had a nails-to-the-chalkboard child actor for Skywalker\\, the ever-annoying Jar-Jar\\, an abundance of unnecessary CGI work\\, and some nagging plot holes\\, but it still stayed true to the prevailing ideals of the overall series.  On that one point I would definitely conceed and thus I could survive the movie's many short-comings.\\n\\nEpisode 8\\, on the other hand\\, is truly gorgeous to look at\\, in every way\\, visually and the musical score wonderfully performed\\, but the director's understanding of the characters\\, and the writing itself\\, I can honestly say are atrocious and absolutely novice at best.  Their lack of effort or consistency slaps every fan of the actual Star Wars lore square in the face with how they dealt with the original four main characters\\, the usage of the force\\, the MarySue plot devices\\, the true held beliefs of the core characters who have already been fully developed in past films\\, and so on. \\n\\nIt felt as if the director had quite literally never seen more than a few Star Wars trailers to have created so many glaring errors.  There are issues in any of the films\\, but these honestly felt wilfully done or created out of a sheer lack of knowledge or diligence on the part of the writers and director.  Episode 7\\, while suffering from too much story and character clutter to an extent\\, set the pace for an amazing new trilogy with a bit of mystery and intrigue(minus the needless and horribly set up Solo death) which 8 has now skillfully erased entirely.  All of the plot points left open from 7 have either been ignored to allow exponential growth within an ever-growing story or have been closed off by killing off everyone and anyone who could fill in the story which has immensely destroyes the sense of intrigue 7 had begun.\\n\\nIt was truly a disappointing experience\\, but I am fast getting used to Hollywood killing all of my childhood favorites.  Episode 9 will definitely be a RedBox rental at best if they plan to continue down such a shallow and vapid path to their storytelling.  When will writers learn that awesome CGI effects and cool explosions cannot make up for poor character development\\, hollow characters\\, and bad writing in general?","true":true}
