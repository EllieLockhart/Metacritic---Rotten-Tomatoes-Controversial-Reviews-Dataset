Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were some really great moments that gave fans nostalgia and some of the acting was great. unfortunately the script was terrible and so unbelievable that it fails as a movie and as a star wars movie. very disappointing.
