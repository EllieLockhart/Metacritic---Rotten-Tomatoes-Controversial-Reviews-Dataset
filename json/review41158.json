Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has done what the prequels could not. Disney has destroyed Star Wars. Both Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy have completely butchered and laid to waste all of what Star Wars is\\, was\\, should have been. This puke of a film is rife with Trump hating\\, sjw\\, pc\\, liberal\\, feminist\\, political views and social commentary. Star Wars is not about American politics and division. Star Wars brought people of all backgrounds\\, races\\, nationalities\\, TOGETHER to cheer for the good guys to defeat the bad guys\\, simple and to the point. NOW\\, it is quite clear\\, Star Wars has become the platform for sjw feminists to spew their white male hating propaganda around the world. R.I.P. STAR WARS we will miss you.","true":true}
