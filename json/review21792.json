Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Just breathe\\\" and go see it a second time.  Enjoy what you liked about it and let go of the anger over the things most of us felt were lacking.  Vitriol over such things leads only to our own harm.  \\\"Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.\\\"  There are\\, truly\\, horrible and heartbreaking things in this world to\\, justifiably\\, hate; this movie is not one of them.","true":true}
