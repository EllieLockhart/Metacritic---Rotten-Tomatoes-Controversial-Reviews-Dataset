Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Spoilers\\\"\\\"Spoilers\\\"\\\"Spoilers\\\"\\\"Spoilers\\\"\\\"Spoilers\\\"\\\"Spoilers\\\"\\n\\nFirst off... this is the most boring space \\\"fight\\\" i have ever seen\\, complet with a subplot that pretty much served no purpose\\, also. really they wouldnt discover a ship going to hyperspace... reallly? come on.\\n\\nAnd Luke? seriously? what a let down. The movie is a fine action movie\\, but as a star wars movie which is suppose to pass on the torch the way they deal with e legacy characters is beyond moronic.... and dont get me startet on that Leia flight crap.. would have been  better if they just cut her out for rest of the movie and let the character die in space and while showing respect for the late Carrie Fisher.\\n\\n#Notmyluke","true":true}
