Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Totally enjoyable and a little more complex than Force Awakens\\, for better or worse. I find it hilarious that so many of the complaints people have center around the idea of strong female characters. Huh? Is it really that uncomfortable to have male characters with flaws? Try watching MOST movies\\, ever\\, and see how many times the male is perfect and women's flaws are shown. If you just watch them as characters without looking for a gender agenda\\, it is just a good story. Luke was NEVER perfect\\, and guess what\\, he still isn't. Leia was always strong (for her time)\\, this is not a departure. Is this movie perfectly everything I could have wanted? No. But it is far from the abomination all of these angry men are whining about. Star Wars always had strong women\\, flawed men\\, diverse species\\, and was \\\"political\\\" in a good vs. evil way. Always. Maybe some people are applying new political filters when they watch it\\, but I'm sorry\\, the whole franchise was built on resistance to the dark side. This is not some new current events theme. They made choices. No one is going to love them all.","true":true}
