Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Politically correct anti capitalist agressively hostile towards male characters and very 2017. Characters are all unimportant. Much excess\\, John Boyes has no purpose either did his new love interest who hates capitalism. Very very 2017 certain scenes can induce cringe otherwise it's a good movie. Just need to avail yourself of the political dogma for a second and its good.  Just wish they didnt force it down our throats in the first place.","true":true}
