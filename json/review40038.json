Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is my favorite Star Wars movie out of all of them. I really enjoyed the storyline and the characters in this plot. I know people have nostalgic feelings with Darth Vader but I really believe Kylo Ren is a superior villain of the series. Overall\\, it is a great movie with great action\\, cinematography\\, characters\\, and storyline. Snoke was the only bad part of the film.","true":true}
