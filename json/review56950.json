Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The way I looked forward to The Last Jedi is similar to how much I looked forward to Alien: Covenant.  With Prometheus\\, Ridley Scott setup a lot of possibilities to explore with a sequel.  Then Alien Covenant comes out and turns into just a crappy Alien movie.  So many possibilities. The Force Awakens introduced a lot of new characters and story lines and questions.  I was so looking forward to see where the sequel took the franchise.  Right from the start the movie just bombs.  Instead of exploring new stories and expand on the characters\\, the movie just turned it a stockpile of mixed humor and did not give the audience time to get attached to the story.  Maybe because there really wasn't a story.  I don't know.  I did not enjoy the movie at all.  The prequels felt more Star Wars than this movie.  Sorry but there is just nothing I can think of from the movie that I enjoyed.  Worst of all\\, it does not set up the 3rd movie in such a way that I look forward to it much like The Force Awakens did.  After I watched The Force Awakens\\, my friends and I were saying how we hated that we had to wait 2 years to find out where the film goes next and what happens to Luke Rey. I just feel nothing for the next movie.","true":true}
