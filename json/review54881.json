Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's as if Rian Johnson were beat up as a child by Star Wars fans so he secretly decided to destroy the film saga because of it. The explanations throughout the movie are atrociously UN-SCIFI ! The ships are \\\"smaller and weigh less\\\" (um it's space there is no weight!) They are light SABERS not LASER swords. \\nBombers in space that \\\"drop\\\" bombs? Hyperspace is now going really fast and anything in your way blows up.  Oh and the lead character learns everything she needs in a day practicing by herself ?!\\nThese are just the things off the top of my head that make it bad\\, yet alone the HORRIBLE dialogue !!","true":true}
