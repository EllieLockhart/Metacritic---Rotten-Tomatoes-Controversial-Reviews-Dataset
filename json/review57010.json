Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Things that did not ruin the movie: the humor\\, the \\\"treatment\\\" of \\\"beloved\\\" characters\\, \\\"SJWs.\\\"\\nThings that did ruin the movie: almost everything else.\\nAn attempt to make a Game of Thrones pastiche out of Star Wars\\, this movie is incredibly in love with itself\\, concerned with subverting audience expectations in every scene. This might be forgivable except that all the meat-and-potatoes movie-making was awful. The acting was bad\\, the roles written for the actors were bad\\, the plot revolves around an absurd 90 minute slow-speed car chase\\, like the OJ Simpson White Bronco joyride in outer space. That was the second worst sequence in the film-history of Star Wars\\, topped only by the side-quest to Planet Monte Carlo in this film. Nothing in the justly-derided prequels is as bad as these scenes\\, which dominate the run time of The Last Jedi. I only wish that was hyperbole. The characters arcs are like something out of a German art film. Poe learns to run away\\, Finn learns not to risk his life to save his friends or to stop evil\\, Rey and Kylo Ren reach a consensus that they then formally discard because there needs to be more Star Wars\\, Leia learns that she's too old and ugly to be in charge. \\nIronically\\, Mark Hamill\\, long derided as a one-role actor\\, almost saves the film. Pitched yet another set of bad Luke Skywalker lines\\, he takes his off-speed pitch deep to left field\\, over the fence\\, and into the night. You can see his decades of experience as a minor actor and VO coming to play here. I will probably watch his scenes and Rey's scenes again; I can't imagine sitting through any other part of it.","true":true}
