Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a disaster. We waited two long years for this?! Terrible plotting\\, poor to no character development and cheap juvenile self-deprecating jokes. \\n\\nThe worst of it is how this movie treats Luke Skywalker. The Last Jedi (TLJ) portrays him as a tired cranky old burnout who refuses to train Rey and be the mentor she needs him to be. The mentor that we want him to be. Luke is completely disillusioned with the Jedi\\, the Force\\, the plight of the Resistance\\, Good vs. Evil\\, and \\\"laser swords\\\". Basically he's over \\\"Star Wars\\\" and has come to this secluded planet to die alone. But if he didn't want to be found why is there a map that leads to him? Finding Luke Skywalker was what \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" (TFA) was all about. Apparently we're supposed to accept that was a giant dead-end. A big joke on us because Luke isn't going to help anyone. \\n\\nAt the end of TLJ\\, after a lesson with Force Ghost Yoda\\, Luke decides to help the Resistance and his sister by projecting an image of himself that battles Kylo Ren long enough so the Resistance can escape certain doom. We then cut back to the actual exhausted Luke meditating on his island before he fades away into the Force. \\n\\nThis interpretation of Luke is more about subverting our expectations than satisfying them. This film ask us to accept that the Luke\\, who went from being a whiny na\u00efve farm boy to the hero who helped rescue a princess\\, destroyed the Death Star\\, saved the Rebellion and defeated the evil Palpatine by turning Darth Vader back to the Light is now nothing more than a disillusioned Jedi dropout. \\n\\nWhat about Obi Wan when he failed Anakin\\, the precious \\\"Chosen One\\\" who was meant to bring balance to the Force? When Anakin became Darth Vader he murdered the children in the Jedi Temple\\, practically murdered his wife Padme and then helped the Empire hunt down and destroy all of the remaining Jedi throughout the galaxy. Did Obi Wan give up after failing Anakin? Did Obi Wan decide it was best to turn his back on everything and leave the universe to itself? Luckily for us he didn't or else the Storm Troopers would have killed Luke along with his aunt and Uncle and the stolen Death Star plans would have been safely returned to the Empire resulting in the destruction of the Rebellion. In other words\\, if Obi Wan had given up like Luke does in TLJ\\, there never even would have been a \\\"Star Wars\\\".  \\n\\nThe biggest fallout from this\\, and one that Disney would be wise to consider\\, is how this deeply unsatisfying conclusion to Luke's story affects our viewing of the original trilogy.  If we know that Luke\\, after all of his achievements\\, will become nothing more than a grumpy old disillusioned hermit who turns his back on everything he loved\\, do we really care to know him at all? I don't think we do.  And therein lies the risk that Disney needs to heed. Otherwise their audience\\, like Luke in TLJ\\, might just fade away.","true":true}
