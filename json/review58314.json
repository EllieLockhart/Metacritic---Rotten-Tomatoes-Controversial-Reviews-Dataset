Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"According to Disney\\, the Force is political correctness\\n\\nAfter watching Star Wars VII\\, The Force Awakens (TFA)\\, I actually had a new hope (pun intended) for the Star Wars franchise. It was fun and exciting\\, it generally respected the original characters\\, it introduced new characters\\, and yes\\, the old characters was certainly gracefully giving way to the new characters. I thought it was a great way to start the next trilogy. So I was hoping that Star Wars VIII\\, The Last Jedi (TLJ)\\, would now cement a new set of long-lasting\\, memorable characters in the guise of Kylo\\, Rey\\, Finn\\, Poe and even the new \\\"Emperor\\\" Snoke. Great scott\\, I was so wrong. What in the world was that mess all about? The Last Jedi was so crammed with politically correct ideology (all men are stupid and degenerate\\, all women are clever and enlightened). Characters like Poe that showed so much hope in TFA\\, even Snokes showed some weight at the beginning of TLJ\\, and even Luke Skywalker himself\\, but they ALL completely degenerated into nobodies in TLJ. And oh my goodness\\, the whole claptrap ideology about women being the enlightened and evolved ones and men being the old patriarchy and degenerating into dumb monkeys is so obvious it made me nauseous. By the end of The Last Jedi\\, I was dying to re-watch Transformesr 1-5 all over again - at least Michael Bay didn't PRETEND there was a story (nor politically correct ideology) and the effects were good!\\n\\nThe force has indeed awakened\\, only to fall asleep again... Disney is fast becoming a politically correct school for kids.","true":true}
