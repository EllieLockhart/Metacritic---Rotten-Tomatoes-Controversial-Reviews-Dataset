Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is an example of poor script and story writing.  Stupid movie logic?  Checked.  Apparently all ships move at exactly the same speed.  It's impossible to send a ship in hyper speed to go ahead of a slow capital ship. Useless plot lines ?  Checked.  Finn &. Rose useless adventure added nothing to the story.  They accomplished nothing except almost get the Resisrance destroyed twice. Lack of epic moments?  Except for the suicide run by the ship\\, nothing epic about the movie.  PS look at Rouge One.  Who is Snoke?  Nobody just a useless prop.  Respect for the original characters who's been with us over 30 years?  Nope.  Luke didn't even fight.  He was just a sad old man.  The 50% audience score is right on.","true":true}
