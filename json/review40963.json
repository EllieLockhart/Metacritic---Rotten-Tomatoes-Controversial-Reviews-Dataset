Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie does have some setbacks i admit. the runtime was long and there were too many jokes but overall i find this movie to be good movie and it does not fail to surprise you","true":true}
