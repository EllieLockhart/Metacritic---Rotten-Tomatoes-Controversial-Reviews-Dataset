Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a very brave film.   This is a 40 year old beloved franchise\\, and the last movie in the saga was criticised for staying very safe.  This one does not.  Rian Johnson has taken legitimate risks\\, and for the most part\\, for me at least\\, they paid off.  I think this one\\, for the Star Wars fan will work better on a second viewing.  As fans we go into a Star Wars movie burdened with our own expectations\\, and sometimes it's hard to look past the fact that our expectations are not fulfilled.  On a second viewing\\, once you know that this movie probably raises more questions than it actually answers\\, you can enjoy the movie for what it actually is\\, rather than what you were expecting it to be.","true":true}
