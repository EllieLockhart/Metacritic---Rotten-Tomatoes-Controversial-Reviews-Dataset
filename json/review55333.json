Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Little spoilers. Really disappointed with this movie. I was really looking forward to the development of The new characters from force awakens and Luke. What we got was a hot mess that does nothing to further the story.  All that we know and love about the classic Star Wars was thrown out for who knows what. Who is Snoke...you don't need to know\\, who are Rey's parents\\, who cares...because anybody can be a Jedi...right?","true":true}
