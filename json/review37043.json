Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The negative audience reviews are proof Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy got it right! The movie is undeniably STAR WARS\u2014not your MEMORY of \u201cstar wars\u201d drenched in all of your nostalgic misconceptions and dramatic lost childhood nonsense\u2014just pure STAR WARS. The Last Jedi is intense\\, campy\\, emotional\\, and uplifting all at the right notes. It\u2019s a fitting\\, but brutally honest tribute to a character I\u2019ve wanted to be my whole life. Best of all\\, the film leaves the universe wide open and ready to grow with my children. I couldn\u2019t ask for more. ","true":true}
