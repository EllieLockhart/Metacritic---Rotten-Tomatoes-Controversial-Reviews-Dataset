Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the WORST Star Wars movie ever produced.  There were two worthwhile scenes in this movie.  The rest was craptastic and made no sense.  I feel sorry for the actors and actresses who suffered through this garbage.  Garbage story. Garbage writing.  Tried watching again on Netflix to see if I was just in a mood or something but no. I couldn't even watch it.  Sad.","true":true}
