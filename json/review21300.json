Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went in with an open mind\\, and even gave it a second shot.  But\\, terribly disappointed.  The unneeded millennial comedy\\, and disregard for what made the series close to so many hearts\\, is very disappointing.  Rouge One had given me hope that the series was back on track\\, but now we are back to The Phantom Menace level.   If they wanted to make a Guardians of the Galaxy knock off they did a good job.","true":true}
