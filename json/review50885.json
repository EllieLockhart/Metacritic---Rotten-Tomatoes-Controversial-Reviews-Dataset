Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A breath of fresh air! To the people freaking out about force powers..get out of the house more. Luke hung out with Yoda a quarter of the time Rey spent training with Luke. This isn\u2019t gospel...it\u2019s Star Wars (operatic and sweepingly high level).","true":true}
