Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't fathom the negative reviews. I think it's like 15 trolls posting multiple reviews. I'm a longtime fan\\, and I loved it Rian Johnson should be given the keys. Abrams is the best director\\, but the script\\, character work\\, and plot ideas in this film are so much better than anything except the original and Empire. I mean...it is hard to compare movies that come out when you are in your 49s to movies you've loved for as long as you can remember. The movie has a few minor things that I might have changed\\, but it actually had IDEAS and PHILOSOPHY and character growth and shades of gray. Loved it.","true":true}
