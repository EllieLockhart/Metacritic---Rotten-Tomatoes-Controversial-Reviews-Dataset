Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After being briefly excited about this movie and seeing it for the second time i officially  declare Star Wars dead! They killed the franchise! There were few good moments in \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" but after seeing it again all i see is a flaw script and endless plot holes...And all mysteries we were so excited to unravel like Rey's or even Snoke's background just die with such a dissapointment ... They did everything  they could to absolutely undermine  the legacy of the original trilogy! Even \\\"Rouge  One\\\" honored first Trilogy's legacy  but with this movie Disney managed to completely destroy it for the sake of trying desperately  to recreate what the first trilogy already was....instead of building from it! Luke's character  and his legacy is completely destroyed\\, there are countless character  flaws (even in Han Solo's character  in the previous movie) ...needless to say for the sake of making more money off of the name they buchered what was left from the original Trilogy's  heart! Completely removing any substance and intelligence for the sake of visually beautiful but brainless cinematography :(","true":true}
