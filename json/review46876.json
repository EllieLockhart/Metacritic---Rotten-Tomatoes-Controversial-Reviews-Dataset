Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well worth the wait. I understand why the \\\"hardcore fans\\\" are a little peeved about this film as it's  without a doubt a different flavour to the other moivies. It's had a bit too much of the \\\"Disney magic\\\" applied (casino) that needs to be tamed in later releases. But all in all a good film well worth the wait..... Only bit that wound me up a bit after really thinking about it is that the empire need to invest in better engines! (Watch to find out what I mean)....... Still loved it :)","true":true}
