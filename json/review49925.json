Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You have got to be kidding me...  You have taken something beautiful and interesting and made it boring and ugly.  We waited 30 years (through the prequels no less) to see what Luke would become\\, how he would grow.  Would he be the godlike entity we all wanted (and got in eu) him to be?  F*ck no he's an old crotchety bitch.  How amazingly disappointed I am in everyone involved in the creation of this pile.  I don't want my money back\\, I'd pay twice over again if i could forget I ever saw this turd and remember star wars the way it was.  Nothing good has happened in this universe since 1983\\, and this was by far the worst yet.  This film killed star wars.","true":true}
