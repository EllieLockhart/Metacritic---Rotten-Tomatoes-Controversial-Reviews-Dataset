Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After watching TLJ twice I have concluded that it is my least favorite SW film so far. There is a lot of wonderful eye candy in this film however the overbearing horrible writing\\, character development\\, plot holes and cheesy attempt at self deprecating humor had me less involved as a viewer. I left the theater feeling underwhelmed regardless of my initial expectations. I hope JJ Abrams can turn this around. In the end I did enjoy the fight scenes and twists\\, but the quest to find the code cracker scenes should have simply been removed.","true":true}
