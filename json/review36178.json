Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was fantastic! Big risks were taken throughout the film\\, and most of them paid off. The dynamic between Rey and Kylo was incredible. Carrie Fisher was magical on the screen. Mark Hamill did a great job at showing how damaged and bitter that Luke has become over the years. Poe Dameron stole the show for me\\, and played his role perfectly. Benicio Del Toro's character of DJ didn't really land for me\\, nor did a lot of the storyline with Rose and Fin. There was a lot of humor in this film\\, maybe too much at times\\, but given just how bleak that this film was\\, the humor was a much needed reprieve. The score and cinematography were beautiful. In all\\, I loved this film\\, and I can't wait for Episode IX!","true":true}
