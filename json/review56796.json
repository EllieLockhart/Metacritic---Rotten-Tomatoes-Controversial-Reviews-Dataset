{"101487":177796,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-14","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The original trilogy is just apart of me\\, I love them\\, and I actually respect the storyline and action in the prequels\\, not a super hater.  Awakens was ok\\, fun-filled\\,  but I felt lacking\\, expecting Last Jedi to pick up the awesomeness...  SPOILERS.... Very cool opening\\, but the depressing annihilation of the resistance set the tone for the whole movie... made you sad to be a star wars fan.  Anything to do with Canto\\, Rose\\, and starships running out of gas = embarrassing suck.  Needed a little more Luke\\, even though I absolutely loved Lukes action towards the end\\, I hated his last moment. Rey was cool\\, but man she needed more time with Luke. Cool fights\\, but not one lightsaber touched another lightsaber which I found weird. Leia's space float I am mixed\\, a nice twisting moment that is ruined by disbelief.  Wish they had at least one sentence from Obi-Wan\\, after all\\, he was Lukes ghost from the get go.  I actually really enjoyed Snoke's twist\\, but Disney gives an FU goes to anyone who wanted to know more about him. I don't actually hate the Porgs\\, and might buy my kid a stuffed toy one\\, but I do hate how my favorite movie franchise has made me not care about the next installment.  To many eye roll moments\\, to much disney mass audiance consideration\\, although some specticle\\, not enough\\, and not enough story to be fully invested.","true":true}
