Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All I have to say is that Rian Johnson is a god among men who literally did what I thought no one could. I was beyond pleasantly surprised last night; I was thrilled\\, captivated and smiling like a buffoon through every single set up\\, revelation and character development. Hats off to an amazing cast\\, with a phenomenal script. This is storytelling at its finest.","true":true}
