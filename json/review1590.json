Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a long-term Star Wars fan\\, this movie really exemplifies where Disney chose to betray the audience. There's enough good material to make it worth a watch if it's free or a dollar\\, but honestly it's just a waste. It does not advance the story and needlessly kills off two characters. Carrie Fisher (may she rest in peace) could have simply disappeared gracefully\\, rather than having Disney tread all over her memory. Mark Hamill was pointless in passing. And... That's the movie. All of it.","true":true}
