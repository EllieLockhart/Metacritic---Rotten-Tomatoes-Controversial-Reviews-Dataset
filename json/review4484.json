Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Character interactions were even better than TESB.  Porgs were not over done.  There may be some negative response to some preconceived plot expectations.  Luke was right: it did not go the way I thought.  A lot of new aspects to the Force imagined that may get mixed reactions from SW fans. Only negative for me: Phasma is still a total dud.","true":true}
