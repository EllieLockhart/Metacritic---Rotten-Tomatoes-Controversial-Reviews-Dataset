Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite what quote unquote fans say about this movie\\, this film dares to defy tradition and do something new and it works. Finally there\u2019s a Writer and Director who\u2019s willing to go out of the comfort zone of a traditional Star Wars movie. This film has been subject to almost universal disgust by \u201cfans\u201d but the \u201cfans\u201d are the ones who are disgusting. The constant threats\\, and bullying towards the director are sickening. The bullying of cast members off Twitter is vile. I\u2019m glad there was someone who finally did something different and spit in the face of Tradition. This movie isn\u2019t perfect or a masterpiece but damn it\\, it goes its own way I commend the hell out of it for doing it.","true":true}
