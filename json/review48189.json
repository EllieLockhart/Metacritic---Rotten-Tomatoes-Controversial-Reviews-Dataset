Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While watching the movie I felt that the magic was lost. Lovable characters like Luke and Lea becoming old and petty that you just feel they should be put out of their misery\\, even C-3PO becoming a shadow of his brilliant self. The new characters are just not empathy inspiring perhaps John Boyega's Finn is the closest but definitely getting lost through the plot. Watching the last 30 minutes of the film was pure torture feeling like it's too much too little. At least by \\\"joining the force\\\" the old & petty Luke Skywalker is saving face from appearing in the next sequel.","true":true}
