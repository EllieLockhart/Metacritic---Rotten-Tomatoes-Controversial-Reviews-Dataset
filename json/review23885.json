Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Major plot holes throughout the movie. The entire Rose character\\, side story\\, and relationship with Finn was terrible and took screen time away from Rey\\, Luke\\, and Kylo. Kylo is phenomenal. His struggle with the light and dark is great and carried the film. Rian destroyed whatever Snoke could have and should have been. No backstory given and killed him off like a chump without even a fight scene.  Ruined Lukes character also for good measure. There are more issues that i wont cover. Now Abrams has to clean up and finish this mess that Rian created. Disney needs to keep whoever came up with the Rose character and plot and Rian away from anything Star wars related in the future.","true":true}
