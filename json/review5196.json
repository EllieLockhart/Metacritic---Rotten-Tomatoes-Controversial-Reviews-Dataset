Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dear The Force\\, if this is the best you can do\\, I'm going to become a Force Athiest or a Sith. What a soul less\\, piece of garbage this movie was. I'm still processing just how much I hate it. From terrible way they treated the characters in the franchise (notably Luke and Finn)\\, to the plodding pace\\, and generic plot\\, this movie fails in almost all areas. I wish it had never been made as it destroys the legacy of Star Wars films. I have not been so depressed at the end since I watched 8 MM. Such a downer of a movie. I have heard people say to give it points for doing something different\\, but the sad thing is this follows the structure of Empire Strikes Back while managing to suck on almost all levels. I'm never paying to watch another Star Wars (or Rian Johnson) film. Peace out Star Wars. I used to love you\\, but it's time we started seeing other people. RIP Star Wars.","true":true}
