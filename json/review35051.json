Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first half was quite enjoyable and I really thought that some aspects were fantastic (i.e. the connection\/interaction between Rey and Kylo Ren). However\\, in the end\\, none of the interactions between any of the characters or plot points prove to be satisfying. Finn and Rose are inconsequential\\, Poe makes horrible decisions\\, light speed tracking destroys much of the foundation of Star Wars\\, the battle mechanics between the First Order ships and the Rebellion ships are ludicrous and frustrating\\, Rey doesn't actually learn anything from Luke... and it goes on. I don't need a heroic\\, happy ending. But everything that happens in this movie feels like it happens for no good reason at all with no meaningful outcome. It's meaningless meaninglesness.","true":true}
