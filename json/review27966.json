Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot disjointed\\, hokey\\, tired and a forced painful exercise where the priority of casting and storyline seemed to be more concerned in selling a contemporary political agenda or perspective rather than telling a worthy story.","true":true}
