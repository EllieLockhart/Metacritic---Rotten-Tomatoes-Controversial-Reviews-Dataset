Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't believe the hype\\, good movie\\, not the great Star Wars film that is being proclaimed\\, not a slice on Empire or a New Hope and I would say that the Force Awakens was a more enjoyable film\\, wasted characters in Snoke\\, Hux\\, Captain Phasma (again) and I dont know what the point was for D.J's speech stutter.\\nIt seems to be that the one thing that is missing is\\, dear I say it Han Solo\\, the saga seems to have taken a huge leap into the fantastical\\, spoiler alert\\, a flying indestuctible Leia and a holographic Luke Skywalker (who has gone to weight watchers and got a haircut). The character of Kylo Ren has taken a huge step backwards\\, he just lacks the guts or terror that Vader processed\\, every time he gets angry he either pushes someone or punches a hole in a wall (they should make a side movie about Star Wars gib stoppers). I love Star Wars\\, but this film seems safe\\, bloated with side characters\\, and a bit of a mess\\, it just seems to lack that emotional punch that we have gotten in the past.","true":true}
