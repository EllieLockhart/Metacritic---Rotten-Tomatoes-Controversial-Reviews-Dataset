Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disapointed... Too many jokes and laughing. The force never was so easy to manage. Snoke was a supreme looser. Leia's flight was like WTF is happening. The dark side is now the gray side.","true":true}
