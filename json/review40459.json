Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the first Star Wars movie that did not leave me excited for the next one.  The Force Awakens may have been heavy on the fan service but the\\, new characters were likeable and I was excited to see their journey\\, along with the characters we already know and love. The Last Jedi threw all of that out the window and disrespected the OT characters and all the work JJ Abrams did setting up the new characters. Luke's treatment is unforgivable. The same person who believed there was still good left in Vader gives up on a kid? Killing Admiral Akbar off screen and giving what should have been his glory moment to the beyond dull and predictable Holdo was unforgivable. Carrie Poppins was cringy. All of Canto Bight was cringy.  The movie is just one disappointment after another.","true":true}
