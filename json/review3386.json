Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Best Film out of the series\\, and I am surprised the audience meter is low\\, prob because it's prob filled with White males who don't like change. I guess they didn't know that the original Star Wars movie was an allegory to the Vietnam War.","true":true}
