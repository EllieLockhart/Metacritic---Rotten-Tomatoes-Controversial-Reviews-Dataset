Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can see where people are coming from in saying that this movie sucked\\, but in all honesty\\, it's a Star Wars movie\\, and The Last Jedi provided some of the most amazing sequences in SW Cinematic History!","true":true}
