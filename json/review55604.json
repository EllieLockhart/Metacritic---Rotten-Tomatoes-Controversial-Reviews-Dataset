Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nothing makes any sense.  Students are supposed to grow beyond their teachers...except that Luke is still learning this lesson from his long--dead teacher's ghost.\\n\\nLuke is the hero who\\, because he always saw the potential for good in people\\, successfully turned Vader away from the Dark Side to destroy the Emperor.  And yet now he stands over a sleeping student with the intent to murder him because he senses a growing darkness in the student?  Maybe the pre-Empire Luke would have reacted incontinently like this\\, but by Return of the Jedi\\, Luke was in control and would not have contemplated murdering his nephew and student.\\n\\nAnd part of the First Order's massive battle fleet can't jump into hyperspace for a second to do a quick flanking maneuver while the rest keeps bombarding the Rebel fleet from a distance?  Seriously?  They don't have a single tactician on any of those ships who knows how to use a fleet of dreadnoughts\\, destroyers\\, and fighters effectively?\\n\\nThe movie is full of nonsensical plot holes like this.  It erases important plot points from last films and can't even stay consistent with itself as a stand-alone film.  Yes\\, there is some eye candy in the special effects battles\\, but what fills in between the action sequences ranges among the gimmicky\\, the preachy\\, and the boring.  It's hard to care about anything in this suddenly nihilistic world.","true":true}
