Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just to set the record straight\\, I love Star Wars and Im not sure what happened with this movie\\, it shined in some parts but not enough for it to be a Star Wars Film\\, i left the theatre confussed at what i had seen !.\\nFirst\\, The legend that is Luke Skywalker has been done a huge injustice\\, the way he was protrayed in this film is fundamentally flaud\\, why leave a map to your location if you just want to fade away and die? this question has no answer as it is a major plot flaw\\, next on the hit list is why do we need to see Luke suckle from the tit of a weird seal like creature? we all know he needs to eat and drink but in all honesty this was just wrong!\\nThe worst thing they have done is portray Luke Skywalker as a killer\\, this is the hero of the franchise\\, he balanced the galaxy and brought peace to it by turning his farther from the darkside effectively setting up the events as to how the emperor was defeated. Luke would never try and kill his own nephew because he was conflicted with the dark side or had seen the future.\\nAnd the greatest injustice of the film is what happened at the end\\, Luke skywalker vanishes into thin air\\, like yoda did! yoda was 900 years old whats Lukes storey\\, I feel that this was disney rushing to kill off the old trilogy. It was so close to being perfect\\, Luke shows up and faces Kylo\\, says sorry to leia and helps the rebellion escape\\, perfect hero moment!\\nit became over written\\, If the outcome is death for Luke why project yourself across the galaxy to get the same result\\, I thought that when this scene started it was going to be the legendary ending to Luke\\, the last Trained jedi!    but it was not\\, it was so NOT!\\nThe sub plot with Fin and rose was a wast of time\\, it didnt do anything for the eventual outcome of the storey... \\nInstead of going with the force awakens storeyline\\, it was completely distroyed\\, we still have no idea where snoke came from\\, or how he became supreme leader\\, but before that could be explained\\, he is killed be a conflicted Kylo Rhen\\, could have become so much more!!\\nI loved the opening battle\\, even the humor was ok\\, as it may be setting a standard for Poe\\, But Leia surviving the explosion that also shot her of into space was far from good writing\\, she did this little superman fly back to the ship\\, litterally knocked on the door\\, and when it opens she falls in\\, ummm! hello\\, this is so stupid its laughable! the compression on the ship doesnt change when the door is opened\\, I'm confussed how is that possible in any galaxy.\\nit would have been an honerable exit for Leia\\, but again it was over written! we now have to see leia at some point die without actually being a part in the next film.\\nall that aside the last jedi really does push the boundry\\, it had some great inclusions to the character list\\, probably the greatest lightsaber battle of all the films and has potential for episode 9.\\n\\nMy final thought is that the last jedi really failed to give me the Star Wars experience i hoped for after all the years of loving the franchise\\, I feel that the phantom menace is now not the worst film in the franchise.\\n\\nvery Poor","true":true}
