Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dumb fun is the best way I can describe this movie. There were some genuinely exciting and enjoyable moments like the opening sequence\\, a certain light speed jump and there were some good parts on the island. But there were many times where I couldn't help but slap my palm to my face like every time we cut back to slowest chase sequence in cinematic history\\, the entirety of Finn's B story at the Casino\\, Snoke's Hue Hefner robe and red colored love room\\, and of course a really silly Force moment that was supposed to be powerful but had the whole theater cracking up. Not to mention plot holes so big that light couldn't escape. Overall\\, I had a little fun in a handful of parts\\, but it was lacking a lot of the emotion I was hoping for and the story could have been a lot cleaner. Like with The Force Awakens\\, I saw it once and that's all I need. I don't feel like I'll have the urge to ever watch it again.","true":true}
