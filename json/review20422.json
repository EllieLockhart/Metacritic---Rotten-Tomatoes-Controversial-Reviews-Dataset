Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I used to say they could make a crappy Star Wars and I'd still probably just be happy a new one came out... That was definitely proved wrong with The Last Jedi. This could probably be blamed on the fact it hardly felt like a Star Wars movie. And the few parts that felt like Star Wars were because they were some of the main plot points we have already seen before! Again\\, it was like The Force Awakens where it just seemed like they took parts of old movies and tried to fit them in as new\\, but failed. Some of the plot points and character development were really weak and didn't make sense. Finally\\, maybe it was just because I was sour about everything else\\, but they seemed to try and force funny one-liners anywhere they could like they do in Transformers\\, some were funny...others weren't needed. Overall\\, disappointing.","true":true}
