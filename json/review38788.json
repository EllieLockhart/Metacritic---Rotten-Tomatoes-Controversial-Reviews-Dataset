Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They have ruined star wars. To much cheese and comedy moments. They have turned luke into a pussy. \\nIt as a poor plot line\\, wasted half of the movie with something that Did not make sense and did not add to the film what so ever.\\nI felt sorry for the die hard fans who have waited so long for this. It comes to something when fan theories are better than the whole movie.","true":true}
