Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It felt like Rian Johnson made this film to please critics rather than fans. That's where he and JJ differ. The fans have kept this franchise alive for 42 years - they deserve to be given something. JJ should have done all 3 - simple as that. The Last Jedi still has some visually awesome scenes and I love the tension building between Rey and Ren but everything else just seemed a bit pointless. And to completely assassinate Luke's character is unforgivable.","true":true}
