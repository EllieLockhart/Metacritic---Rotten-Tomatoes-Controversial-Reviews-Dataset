Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"WIthout any of the heart or meaning of the originals and even the prequels. Might be the worst film of the series so far. The Disney Star Wars movies are noticeably missing the creator and beating heart of the franchise. Crude rip-offs and political messaging weigh this movie down and it ends up having no message or point to whatsoever. There are no character arcs and ridiculous loop holes in the plot. Needed a singular vision for the whole trilogy because it just feels jumbled and confused. Massive shame that Star Wars has been revived\\, just to be brutally tortured. A lot of potential\\, a lot of disappointment.","true":true}
