Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Personagens mal aproveitados\\, e a morte mais rid\u00edcula de um her\u00f3i\\, e um \\\"supervil\u00e3o\\\" que poderiam ser muito mais bem explorados\\, uma segunda metade de filme horr\u00edvel e morta que n\u00e3o leva a lugar algum e a clara e forte tentativa de se desfazer do cl\u00e1ssico que amamos e colocar que o novo \u00e9 melhor\\, comete o erro de fazer desse um filme que mata a franquia. Simplesmente triste ver o que aconteceu com a saga\\, e saber que existem v\u00e1rios erros desses no cinema de desfazer-se do bom e cl\u00e1ssico para colocar o novo nada legal e especial garganta a baixo dos f\u00e3s.
