Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What did you do to Luke?!\\n\\nShame on you Rian Johnson!  All you had to do with this film is give us some direction with the new additions from The Force Awakens and treat the movie's old stars with reverence - instead to drove this off the cliff!\\n\\nI have disliked movies before\\, but I've never felt such disgust leaving a theater as I did when I finished watching this.  The plot was nonexistent\\, dialogue and some acting were bad and there was no character development.  They should show this movie in scriptwriting courses of what NOT to do!\\n\\nPoor Luke (and Mark Hammil)\\, he deserves better than to go out like the chump you made him out to be.","true":true}
