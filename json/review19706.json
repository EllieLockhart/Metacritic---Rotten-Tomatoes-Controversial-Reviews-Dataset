Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a great movie in terms of checking things of with a critic but the thing that lets this movie down for me is the direction they take the characters. I personally didn't like where they went with Rey\\, Luke and Snoke. The first shock from the twists takes a while to sink in and after it does you decide weather you like it or not. I decided I did not. I really enjoyed Leia\\, Kylo and Poe in this movie however\\, as I thought they had the best character development and most interesting stories and I also thought the direction the characters where taken in was far better than some others. Overall if you are a hardcore Star Wars fan YOU NEED TO SEE THIS MOVIE\\, but if you're not then don't stress about it\\, just avoid spoilers as it could ruin your whole viewing experience.","true":true}
