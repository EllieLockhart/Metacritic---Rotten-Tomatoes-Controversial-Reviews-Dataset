Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It gets one star for the crew\\, caterers and background actors that put in so many sleepless hours to get this complete joke of a film made. Subverting expectations is NOT what star wars needed.","true":true}
