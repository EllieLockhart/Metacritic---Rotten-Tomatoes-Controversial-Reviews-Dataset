Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What can I say? Is it better than Empire?... No\\, but almost. Does it live up to the Force Awakens?... It most definitely does. Is it a stunning visual masterpiece that made me rethink the whole Star Wars franchise?... it would be an obvious lie if I said no.\\nI praise Rian Johnson for his work\\, he blew me at a level I could not even imagine. He gives the best action sequences in a Star Wars film and a compelling narrative that does justice to the universe and the heroes alike. \\nThe acting delivered is just incredible. Mark Hamill shines\\, Daisy Ridley is marvelous\\, Adam Driver's performance is staggeringly good and the late Carrie Fisher is simply amazing. The movie is a beautiful tribute to her career. Just go watch it.\\n\\nCan't wait for Episode 9!!!","true":true}
