Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such a refreshing take on the series. As a fan who has seen all the films and shows\\, and read most of the original and modern EU content it was an amazing ride. A few plot holes but hey\\, it's Star Wars. It had plot holes in all the movies so far\\, why stop now.","true":true}
