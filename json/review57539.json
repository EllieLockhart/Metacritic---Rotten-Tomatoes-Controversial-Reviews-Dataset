Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was easily the most disappointing  movie experience I have ever had. Abrams did a fantastic job with The Force Awakens \\,  creating an intriguing new story and developing  meaningful characters  essential the to the trilogy. However\\, all of that is nullified in this movie. The movie revolves around a sense of magical realism that only small children with no higher than a 1st grade education could find remotely plausible\\, even for a Star Wars movie. The director of The Last Jedi\\, Rian Johnson\\, is either the least  qualified person on earth to direct a movie or he intended to decimate the characters and plot that were set up in The Force Awakens. He provided us a film with literally no significance or resemblance to the other movies\\, ruined the integrity of the franchise and introduced absolutely ZERO meaningful plot twists or sequences to set up the next movie. Disney should seriously consider making a another second installment to replace this atrocity as it would generate more revenue for them and provide Star Wars fans with a restored purpose to watch the third installment.","true":true}
