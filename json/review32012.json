Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS: During long discussions I've had with a friend regarding Rey's lineage\\, my girlfriend finally chimed in with \\\"why does she have to be related to ANYONE in the old movies?\\\" Rian Johnson's depiction brings the force back to its egalitarian roots. If this movie takes place in a giant galaxy with trillions of characters from all walks of life\\, what is this fascination people have with everyone being related? Obviously George Lucas is part of this - making Luke\\, Vader\\, and Leia of the same bloodline - but the idea that Rey's parents HAVE to be characters from former movies is ridiculous. Like Anakin\\, it can be available even to slaves of humble origin. This might deflate the endless speculation that fans are prone to\\, but to me it's refreshing. I like to be challenged\\, but lots of people obviously wanted something more grandiose. Oh well. The low rating is more a reflection of people being butt hurt than bad writing.","true":true}
