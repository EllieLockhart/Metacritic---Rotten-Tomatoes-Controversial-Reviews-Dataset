Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have to admit that this was the first SW movie I was going to walk out on.\\nThe plot was a mess. And generally just lame. I mean\\, the core plot involved having a crippled rebel cruiser limp across space being poked by of big empire ship. Yawn.\\nSome scenes were just ridiculous. So I think bb8 is great\\, but now that he can hijack and control an imperial walker he definitely will have his own spin off series (vs bb9 - who I though had racial undertone).\\nSome more bad things: Leia superman scene (nuking the fridge)\\, Leia recovering in a day or so\\, non funny humour\\, casino world so pointless\\, Snoke character development non-existent\\, fish housekeepers on Luke's island\\, Yoda mentions \\\"page turner\\\"\\, Ben solo topless talking to rey\\, Luke's legend destroyed. Oh I could go on.","true":true}
