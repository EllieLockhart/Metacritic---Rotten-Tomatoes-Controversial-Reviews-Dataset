Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It wasn't the best Star Wars movie but the CGI was good and was shot on film not digital so i like that. Its story was silly though trying to figure out light speed etc it just was a silly story in my view.","true":true}
