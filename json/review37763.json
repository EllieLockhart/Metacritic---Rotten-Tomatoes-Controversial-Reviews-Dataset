Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There was sooooo much wrong with this movie. Ugh!!! Space Leia?!?! Yoda was jacked up and had a Jim Henson Muppet feel. You mean to tell me they have a mountain base with a huge metal door that is impenetrable but wait we did not notice the hole in the back of the cave we could escape from until some ice foxes show us the way?!?!?! Rey's parents you say? Absolutely disappointed that they are nobodies.","true":true}
