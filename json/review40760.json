Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This move is either a reboot or the final in a trilogy.  With all the original cast being gone\\, it sets up as a Kylo vs Rey battle\\, with an outcome that doesn't matter.  Rian has made it clear anyone can use the force\\, so if Kylo wins someone else will rise up to battle him.  If Rey wins then someone from the other side rises up.  Rinse Repeat.  This is not Star Wars this is a space movie.  Star Wars is about the Skywalkers and not that all are gone this is the equivalent of a Star Wars cover band.  You will not be getting my money for Episode 9.","true":true}
