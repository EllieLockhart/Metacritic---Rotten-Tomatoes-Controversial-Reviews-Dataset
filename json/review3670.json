Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Best word I can think to describe The Last Jedi is \\\"surprising.\\\" While The Force Awakens was a movie based on the familiar structure of A New Hope and introduced us to new characters\\, The Last Jedi turns what might have been expected on its head. I didn't feel like I could predict what would happen in the story the way I could in a normal blockbuster movie or The Force Awakens. I don't remember the last time I felt that way while watching a big budget mega-franchise movie. It's incredibly different for a Star Wars movie\\, and I think it is on par with the original trilogy in terms of quality. It may not be what you expect\\, but in a world where formulas dominate movies across all genres\\, and everyone's trying to build a cinematic universe as soon as they can\\, it's a huge breath of fresh air.","true":true}
