Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Worst! Worst Star Wars film ever. And one of the worst films ever. Story sacrificed to heavy-handedly introduce agendas and to set up visuals meant to trick non-thinking audience to like it. At least the prequels had a coherent story. This story made no sense and totally contradicts the previous film's setup. And now Lucasfilm getting bots to raise the rating of this travesty of a film. I'd give this a negative star if I could. IT WAS THAT BAD. Disney cancel Rian's new trilogy unless you really want to lose money.","true":true}
