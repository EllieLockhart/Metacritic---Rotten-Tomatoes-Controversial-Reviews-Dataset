Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Best Star Wars movie -- ever! Awesome! Homage to all 8 prior films (Rogue One included). Great set-up for IX!\\nAnd Disney paid me a nice amount of money for trying to control the damage Rian Johnson has done to them with this crap. I need money!\\nSo\\, please go and buy the DVD\\, BluRay\\, toys\\, clothes and everything\\, and I will get paid and survive another couple of day in my miserable life.","true":true}
