Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Liked it after the first time\\, and liked it even more after the second time.  There are some real tense moments for me in this film especially circulating around the throne room scene\\, cruiser Haldo sacrfice scene\\, and then with Luke at the end.  Also\\, love seeing the tension in Rey and Kylo's relationship.  I don't understand all the hate with this film\\, all the actors did a great job\\, and I'm pumped and looking forward to # 9!!","true":true}
