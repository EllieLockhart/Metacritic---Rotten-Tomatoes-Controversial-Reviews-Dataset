Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The plot of this movie was absolutely terrible. Ryan Johnson\\, Kathleen Kennedy\\, and Disney should be ashamed of themselves. Throw Jar-Jar Abrams in with them for defending this garbage and blaming insecure men. Shame on all of you. I won't be giving them or Disney any more of my money.","true":true}
