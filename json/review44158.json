Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To everyone saying this movie is shit. When i saw this movie the first time i didn't know what to think. it had sour taste in my mount\\, upon digesting the movie and accepting that my expectations wasnt met but they went another way\\, wow what a fucking amazing movie i fucking loved it. the ending was completly appropriate for Luke and everyone should really see it a second time\\, a lot for the characters and plotlines i felt were rushed were not the second time around. see it again!!","true":true}
