Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force Awakens was a good film\\, not perfect but good. It set EP8 up for a home run. But nothing about EP8 is a home run... The Last Jedi is the messiest\\, SWJ infected PC bullshit I have ever seen. 1\/10.","true":true}
