Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Confused\\, cynically pandering\\, and goofy.\\nThe CGI is just awful. Rei meditating on the island was unnatural lighting\\, unrealistic scenery\\, just wrong. But you'll find this everywhere.\\n\\nThis just feels like the effort of corporate shareholders and somewhere buried in that\\, a Star Wars fan who doesn't really get Star Wars. Or\\, more likely\\, somebody\\, or a group of them that just doesn't care and is trying to reinvent it for the most mass appeal\\, in every aspect\\, and doing it with a bludgeon. They bought Lucas' silence with a few billion. Mark Hamill got his millions\\, but he had choice words. He was right.\\n\\nThe last Star Wars movie was the lovingly crafted fan remastered bootleg\\, everything else is second rate.","true":true}
