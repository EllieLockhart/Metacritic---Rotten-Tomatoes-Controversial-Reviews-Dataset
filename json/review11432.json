Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible just plain horrible we deserve a better Luke\\, and Leia.  If your not going to continue with Skywalkers then don't call it Star Wars.  I don't blame Johnson it's the #imperialassholes of JJ Abrahams and Kathleen Kennedy have final say. What a disaster","true":true}
