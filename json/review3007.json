Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bad movie\\, bad actors\\, feminist propaganda\\, nothing like Star Wars. It was so \\\"original\\\" that they used parts from The Matrix and Harry Potter - last Star Wars movie that I pay to watch\\, I am against pirating this movie unless YOU ARE PAID TO DO SO because you will occupy useful space from your HDD or SDD. I literally left the theater with a depression because they've destroyed my favorite SF universe... They need now to ruin Harry Potter\\, Lord Of The Rings\\, and The Matrix\\, and I am done.","true":true}
