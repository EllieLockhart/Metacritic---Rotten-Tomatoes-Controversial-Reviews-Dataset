Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars film that I have ever watched. I have been a huge fan since I first watched Star Wars A New Hope in 1979. This film has destroyed Star Wars and there is no coming back from it. I will not watch the new Solo movie either because the actor they chose is the wrong choice for Han Solo\\, Disney is destroying Star Wars\\, and it is impossible that the \\\"Critics\\\" like this movie\\, I think the 91% score is fake.","true":true}
