Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is a bad movie\\, a disjointed mess full of illogical plot and plenty of plotholes\\, some sections of the movie could be easily removed and there is little to none character development\\,  or questions answered.\\nIt is a VERY bad star wars movie since on top of that it contradicts previous lore\\, and characters of the franchise \\nAnd to add a cherry on the top of this shitcake it is plagued by ideological and not so subtle political propaganda.\\nThe story is bad\\, the characters are bad and it insults audiences with propaganda\\, only tolerable becuase of  very good looking shots and a fight scene","true":true}
