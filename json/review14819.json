Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have to strike it for the story and plot.  These two guys\\, JJ and Rian in their hubris tossed out multiple dozens of plot and canon advancement for the Star Wars universe in NY Times Bestselling novels by lead authors\\, to instead give us comic book level stories that don't hold up.\\n\\nInstead of filling the void of dozens of huge story gaps from Force Awakens\\, The Last Jedi continues the trend\\, all but taking the franchise off a canon and story cliff into the abyss of inane.  They seem to roll the dice in both films and whatever number comes up\\, voila\\, there's a new Force power that one of the Force users can do that makes no sense on any level of progression or  mastery attained or earned.\\n\\nSomehow 30 years after defeating the two greatest Force users\\, Palpatine among them\\, that were the font of the Empire\\, unlike the rational and logical novels\\, in JJ and Rian's bizarro galaxy\\, the Republic not only never won\\, but is now reduced to a room full of remaining participants.\\n\\n30 years later\\, also\\, every move puts forth the latest superweapon\\, now under JJ's watch was now so grandiose to outdo past superweapons\\, is now a planet.  Somehow galactic imperialists didn't get the memo that these things just get blown up\\, and better to build a great fleet of thousands of cruisers instead\\, no?  Again and again\\, these things get taken out by single snub fighters\\, taking down their shields by a few guys on the ground\\, and in the latest film\\, by a single snub fighter to take out the dreadnought's defenses so a single bomber can undo the massive ship that has the rebel fleet wanting to run in terror from.\\n\\nWhere is the republic?  Where is the vast galaxy and its inhabitants\\, it's democracies?  Somehow the wealthy of all the galaxies worlds are all arms dealers who gather on one planet's casinos\\, so they tell us.\\n\\nWhat drivel.\\n\\nThe first Star Wars was filmed when we didn't even have PC's in our businesses or our homes.  We have come a long way since the 1970's.  Well\\, Star Wars didn't get the memo.  We still have gunners at manual turrets that can't hit a snub fighter in Star Wars film after film.  This while in today's U.S. and ally navy ships\\, we have automated defensive turrets that will evaporate super-fast anti ship missiles and warplanes alike.\\n\\nDrivel.\\n\\nThey should have replaced the worn and out of shape actors playing the key trio (though Ford really held up).  Why?  Because they haven't kept themselves up the way Luke and Leia\\, jedi masters (according to novels and logically so) would have.  They should be in peak shape\\, at the peak of their powers.  So now instead of integrating masters into the stories\\, they have to play this plot game of transitioning out the old with the new\\, like the meat sacks of Star Trek Generations.  Enough.  Replace them and use them as the characters deserve for winning stories and film quality\\, not to serve the actors.\\n\\nI want to weep for the franchise.  These vapid story lines are far worse than anything Lucas ever did.  They don't offer canon\\, but canon chaos or canon vapor.  Roll the dice and see what the main characters can do with the Force next.  Pull a Force game card and play it on the board.  Pull a plot card and play it.  There's no sense to any of it on the film board.\\n\\nKathleen\\, JJ\\, and Rian have destroyed the franchise.\\n\\nI pray I'll be alive for a reboot when maybe someone will do justice to the franchise again.","true":true}
