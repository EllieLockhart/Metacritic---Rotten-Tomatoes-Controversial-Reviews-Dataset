{"101487":178182,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are lots of in-depth reviews on here\\, so I'll try and keep it short. Walking out of the theater\\, I had mixed feelings on this movie. It feels like Ryan Johnson wanted to surprise audiences more than he wanted to deliver good\\, fleshed-out storytelling and plot. Spoilers ahead. Snoke. What the heck? To be honest I was smiling when Kylo killed him\\, as it's a twist I certainly didn't expect\\, but the more I think about it\\, the more I'm slightly disappointed by the way it was handled. He was a very mysterious character\\, and in the short few minutes of screen time that he had we saw that he's obviously extremely powerful with the force. This is something that I've wanted to see for a long time. Someone who is so experienced and powerful with the force that they are nearly invincible. Snoke could see into people's feelings\\, manipulate their thoughts\\, override other force users' abilities\\, and more\\, and yet even with all this power we really only get to see him use it for a minute or two\\, and then he's killed incredibly easily by Kylo. No questions answered\\, no fight\\, just a placeholder character for half a movie. As many others have stated the Finn and Rose plot line is completely unnecessary. One of the problems with movies today is that filmmakers put social messages\/political opinions into movies just for the sake of influencing the opinions of the viewers. I don't have a problem with that if that's the goal of the movie or if it contributes somehow to the story line. But the whole animal cruelty thing\\, while a good message\\, was very shoehorned in and had no place in a movie like this\\, or at least it didn't fit in this particular movie. Last few gripes. The movie was too weird. The force vision from Rey was weird in the Force Awakens\\, and somehow they managed to out-weird that with the many-Reys-in-a-row scene in this one. It was totally strange and made no sense. Also\\, I think it's cool that we finally see Leia use the force\\, but that scene in space was also too weird for me. Luke was cool in the end\\, but nowhere near what I had hoped to see. I thought we'd get to see the greatest lightsaber battle in the galaxy before Luke's death\\, but all we get is a few cool dodges\\, a scene of him floating\\, and poof - he's gone. I was VERY sad we didn't get to see a more bad ass Luke. Rey is still overpowered and underdeveloped. The \\\"reveal\\\" of her parents was anti-climactic. I was hoping that her lineage would somehow explain her ridiculously fast progression and understanding of the force\\, but nope\\, that wasn't addressed. Perhaps Kylo was lying to her\\, which I hope is the case\\, but it's not fair for all Jedis to have to train for years just to be able to lift a rock\\, and Rey comes along and cracks an island open without so much as a force 101. Lastly\\, the whole fleet running away thing was stupid. The First Order with all their ships and resources couldn't hit the Resistance because they were too quick? Why not dispatch some Tie Fighters and be done with it? That whole part of the story was slow and made little sense. And that purple-haired lady's death didn't make a lot of sense either. Surely with all this tech there was such thing as autopilot... Although I'm not complaining about her death because her character was annoying.\\n\\nPhew. Now for the good. The lightsaber battle with Rey and Kylo was super cool. Adam Driver did an excellent job as Kylo in this movie\\, and I'm starting to like him more as a villain. The space battles were also pretty cool. I love that the Millennium Falcon still gets its time to shine\\, and this time under the proper trained hand of Chewie. Really liked that. Mark Hamill's portrayal of Skywalker was good. Even after all these years he still managed to remind me of the same Luke in the movies from so long ago. And YODA! I was so happy that Yoda was in this movie\\, and even more happy that it was PUPPET YODA! Yes! The same cranky\\, goofy old Yoda that we knew and loved\\, rather than the very serious Play-Doh ninja from the Prequels. \\n\\nOverall I still enjoyed the movie. Star Wars is a tough franchise to work with because there are so many loyal fans\\, both old and young\\, all who take what happens to their beloved characters very seriously. Now I can't shake the feeling that Disney just put the original actors in just to somehow tie the old movies to the new ones\\, but now the three OGs have been dispatched to make way for Disney's diverse new cast (I guess Leia hasn't officially been dispatched\\, but it's not like she'll be in Episode IX). \\n\\nHmm\\, so much for a short review\\, huh?","true":true}
