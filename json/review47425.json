Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What do you want me to tell you\\, that it was better than Rogue One? Well\\, let's just put it this way: I'd rather watch Rocky Horror Picture Show on repeat 24\/7\\, 365\\, for life than give this movie more than one star. Disappointed was how I felt after the first 5 minutes. Disgusted was the halfway point. You don't even want to know how I really felt at the end of the movie being a self proclaimed #1 Fan.","true":true}
