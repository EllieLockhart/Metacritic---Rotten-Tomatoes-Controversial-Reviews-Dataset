Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A fine addition to the Star Wars-franchise - and clearly the next step in the continuing creation of an entirely new universe. No spoilers here\\, but safe to say that the goal is clearly to make the new characters dominant. Logical\\, if only because the old cast is getting really old (or is actually dead); can't make a new trilogy in 10 years or so with octogenarians. Would be nice to see though that characters that don't age - like R2D2 and C3PO - continue to be important\\, instead of the token extras they are in The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi. I mean\\, come on - R2D2 has been taking out Star Destroyers (and even helped destroy the first Death Star) for\\, oh\\, 50 years. He and C3PO can go on for another 50 - they're robots!","true":true}
