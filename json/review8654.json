Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First time reviewing here. Just couldn't help but give this a bad review. Absolutely destroyed star wars and did not stay true to the saga. Aside from major plotholes\\, the movie was also annoying in that it subverts almost every storyline that the 7th movie placed for fans. After two years of talking about Rey's parentage\\, Snoke\\, Luke etc. the director takes the rug out and leaves the fans feeling stupid. Bad in all levels. Also\\, a big L.O.L. on all those guys saying that alt-right people\\, mysoginists\\, and bots and trolls are to blame about the low ratings. Simply put\\, this is a bad movie that has prompted star wars fans like me to actually spend a few seconds to sign up here and write a review. A bad movie is a bad movie.","true":true}
