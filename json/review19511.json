Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its tragic how so many \\\"talented\\\" people can produce some thing so blatantly terrible on so many levels. Not that they care\\, after all\\, they're too busy counting all the dollars they inevitably make while diminishing the art of story telling and our imaginations. The franchise is a dead prostitute.","true":true}
