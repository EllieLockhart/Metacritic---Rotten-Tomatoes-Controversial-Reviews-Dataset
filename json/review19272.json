Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"It's not going to go the way you think.\\\"  \\n\\nThis is the movie that makes Star Wars relevant again.  They could have kept making easy to watch fun movies for ever and I would have happily watched them\\, however\\, this movie instead did something new.  In doing so it took something I love to another level.  Thank you Last Jedi cast and crew.","true":true}
