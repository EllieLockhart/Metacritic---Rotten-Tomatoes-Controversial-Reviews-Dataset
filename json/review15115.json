Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked everything in this movie except for the Canto Bight sequence and all the jokes that put in it. This move at heart is very dark and the fact they are putting so many jokes in throws the whole tone of the movie off and takes away some of the edge the movie had. The Canto Bight sequence was awful. It was corny and dumb. I was looking forward to this planet but it really disappointed me and a lot of other people. Other than those two gripes the movie is probably my 3rd favorite star wars movie (behind ESB and TFA). The twists were surprising but satisfying\\, the cinematography was great and overall the character arcs and acting was spot on","true":true}
