Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney can't ever be trusted. Disney is satanic AF. Throughout the decades Disney is notorious for disguising indoctrination as entertainment\\, and purveying racial stereotypes\\, overtly and covertly making non-whites the subject of ridicule. Long story short - they set up the actress playing Rose to fail\\, because they don't think enough of ppl of color anyway\\, then project what they did on the fans. It's so condescending on the part of liberal minded SJWs to think being non-white or being female is a social handicap. Ppl like RJ deal with their own covert racist guilt by patting us on the head and overcompensate by writing in useless parts for minorities to play because he thinks he helping us out. It all plays into the satanic divide and conquer NWO agenda anyways.?","true":true}
