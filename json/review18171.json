Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was great\\, it delivers what we expect from Star Wars\\, plot revelations\\, space ship battles\\, lightsaber duels\\, themes of selflessness and to do what's best for the greater good... Mark Hamill's best performance of his career!!!! I love it!!!","true":true}
