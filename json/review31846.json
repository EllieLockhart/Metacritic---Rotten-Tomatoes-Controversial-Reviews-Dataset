Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoiler alert! but to be honest I don't care if I spoil it for anyone\\, people need to know the truth and not the BS reviews we see here . Sadly I am unable to give this 0 stars\\, so 1\/2 it is. . I am sick to my stomach from reading these critic reviews that all appear to be paid for by Disney\\, or written by Rian and his staff\\, or at least scripted by them. No person in their right mind can see this as an official StarWars film\\, because it isn't.\\n\\nLets be very clear.The Top \\\"Critics\\\" are full of hot air and seem to be so scared of getting their early access rights revoked by Disney they are now all rolling over like a puppy dog and letting the big mouse scratch their bellys.\\n\\nIs it a bad movie? no\\, but its not a StarWars movie\\, in any sense. Everything you know about the universe has been re-written \\, raped and pillaged. . Very much how JJ decided to wipe half a century of lore from Star Trek\\, Rian has done exactly the same with StarWars. \\n\\nThe problem we are seeing persistently these days with such predictable directors is they are so keen to establish themselves they will go to any lengths to do so\\, including destroying every part of the story they are meant to be telling us.\\n\\nSure the movie is bang full of special effects\\, which is really just expected these days but the plot and character development was like watching an episode of Dawsons Creek.\\n\\nThe lack of respect shown to Luke's character and so many others is apparent from the start to the finish. The film will leave you on the lowest of lows\\, to the point where now after some 55 years I cannot bring myself to follow this anymore. This is the last starwars I watch and I will be buying no merchandise or anything related to it.\\n\\nThey seem to forget\\, while the kids and parents make up for alot of sales - the dorks that collect toys make up for no less than 50% of it - they have more cash and are more likely to collect the toys over a longer period of time. Well.. someone clearly forgot that part so not only will most of us not watch the next movie\\, we won't buy any merchandise either so while you scaredy cats who are too afraid to say what you think rather than speak the truth for fear of retribution by part-time fans. You know\\, the people that are fans when it suits them.\\n\\nRian Johnson should really be ashamed of what he did with Lukes character. I don't know how he can sleep at night to be honest knowing how badly he treated it. \\n\\nKeep telling people you brush it off your shoulder Rian\\, but when you go to make these 3 new abominations - our wallets will do the talking and I am predicting the biggest loss of any starwars movie ever made in the coming years. \\n\\nNo director can fix what Rian did. He made such a mess that not even all the Kings horses and all the Kings men\\, could not put Luke Skywalker back together again.\\n\\nSo in closing\\, Rian - I hope you honestly get hit by a bus\\, I mean that sincerely - Not to die\\, but just unable to direct any more movies for the next 20 years.","true":true}
