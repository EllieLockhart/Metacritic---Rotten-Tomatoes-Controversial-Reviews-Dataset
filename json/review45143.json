Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unfortunately Star Wars the last Jedi was a big disappointment\\, and I did not like the movie. There was a lot of things left unanswered and unresolved. For all the other problems they faced in the movie it seems like they just took the easy way out. There was very little to no character development\\, and the new character Rose added nothing to the plot of the movie if anything she hindered it. Furthermore Chewie\\,R2-D2\\, and C-3PO where in it for the three  minutes tops. Lastly I did not appreciate how they handled Luke and Snoke\\, the movie looked and sounded great\\, and there were some cool scenes. That is why I give it a 1.5\/5","true":true}
