Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie had such huge potential. The good things about it\\, both daisy and adam are good actors and very entertaining.\\nThe bad. Luke is reduced to a coward of his original self\\, leia is now superman\\, rey gets no training\\, the movie is basically about a ship that ran out of gas trying to run away from the first order. the entire casio scene is completely useless and pointless. phasma is another forced and wasted character. The porges and just there so disney can sell toys. Apparently bombs dont float in space.","true":true}
