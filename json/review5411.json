Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite its faults - for which is has a few - this film is an excellent addition to the saga.  A little unexpected at times is good for the film and the fans.  The humour can be a little too obvious at times but still good.\\nThe biggest issue us that they could probably have cut half an hour without negatively affecting the story or film. However\\, I think the last 45-60 minutes is some of the best of all star wars films.","true":true}
