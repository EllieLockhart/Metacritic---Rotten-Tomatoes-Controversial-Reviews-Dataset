Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Total Chick flick.  Another fantastic franchise ruined by JJ Abrahms and his moronic rewrite of the classics. No plot\\, no storyline...no Jaja Binks...but that would be better than what there was\\, the cast looked like triggered earthlings on a quest to bring single payer veganism to the galaxy. \\nWorst Star Wars yet.","true":true}
