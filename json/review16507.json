Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I must say that I was very disappointed by this film. It has some good moments in it\\, some funny moments\\, but I have major issues with some of the plot choices made by the writer\\, the overall unevenness of the pacing and lack of internal logic in places.\\n\\nYes\\, there are bold choices made in this film\\, but for me those choices mostly didn't work. Too many of the established characters were completely wasted in this film\\, as well as some of the new ones\\, and that probably disappointed me the most. Things also don't add up or make sense if you really think about it. It's as if the writer was going out of their way to subvert expectations for the sake of subverting expectations. I really enjoyed Episode 7\\, despite the well-trodden ground it walked on\\, because it was fun and stayed true to the established characters and lore. But in Episode 8 things are suddenly so dire and hope is completely lost. It undoes some of what was set up in Episode 7 seemingly for the sake of being different or played for laughs.\\n\\nI wanted to really enjoy this film\\, but the flaws are just too great for me to do that. It will also be the first Star Wars film that I will not be buying on DVD or Blu-ray.","true":true}
