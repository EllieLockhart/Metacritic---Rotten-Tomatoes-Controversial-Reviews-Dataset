Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Can't understand the anger towards this movie.  It's a \\\"filler\\\" in the series.  It tells more story than satisfies for entertainment value.  In that regard\\, it gets a bit long.  I enjoyed this film.","true":true}
