Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Haters gonna hate\\, but ignore the Jar Jar fans. This is a movie for old school fans who love the twists and turns of the original films. If you loved the moment that you learned Vadar was Luke's father\\, you'll like this flick. If you liked Jar Jar Binks flopping all over the screen\\, stay home. Daisy steals the show\\, but Carrie stopped me in my tracks with her performance. Enjoy this one\\, true fans! Resist the haters. ","true":true}
