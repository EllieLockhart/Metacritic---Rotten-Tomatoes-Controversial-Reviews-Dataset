Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So any effect's \\, so much work. But story is all over the place\\, too many characters  revealed at once\\, it's too busy\\, to cluttered and confusing. Compared to original Star Wars\\, this is disappointment...But big plus for Art\\, design department and SGI.","true":true}
