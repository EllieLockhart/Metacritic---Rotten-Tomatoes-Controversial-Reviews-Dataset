Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can understand why the hardcore fans don't care for it. I didn't like what was done with Luke Skywalker's character myself\\, but otherwise I didn't think it was that bad. The relationship between Rey and Kylo Ren is what I found most interesting.
