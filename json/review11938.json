Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hugely entertaining - 2.5 hours zips by. (...but make sure to hit restrooms before movie starts!).  Some plot points don't make a lot of sense but 10 seconds later\\, you're whisked into either drop dead gorgeous scenery\\, a battle or unexpected interplay between characters\\, especially between Rey and Kylo Ren.  For me\\, this rates a second (or third) viewing!","true":true}
