Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This isn't going to go...the way you think.  If you felt that Force Awakens was too much of a retread\\, this movie is as different from all other Star Wars films as can be without feeling out of place.  It also uses the \\\"Thor\\\" trick to hide that fact that it is the darkest since ROTS.  I've been asked to rate it among the rest of the Star Wars movie and so far I have failed to do so.  I really haven't processed it.  With the exception of Rey and Leia\\, every other main character has a complete and wonderful character arc...which is usual for a Star Wars movie (The only one done as well was Han Solo in Episode 4).  I also enjoyed that the meaning of the title changes throughout the movie.  I loved the movie and need to see it several more times in order to place it among the other movies.","true":true}
