Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie along with TFA is supposed to be part of the SW saga yet the whole of episodes 7&8 do not give an explanation where the first order comes from. The Empire was defeated as far as i can remember in episode 6. So where the hell does this first order come from? We never get an answer. I would be willing to forgive the SJW crap brought in but i can not forgive bad story telling. My second point: to make an interesting story you need credible villains\\, these guys-i dont even remember the names they're so bad-are anything but credible. There is no tension they're easily defeated. TBH it is like playing a computer game on the lowest possible level where you win every game without any struggle. There is no epic battle it is like the director wanted to make sure we dont get too exited. Wont watch any future SW film made by Disney.","true":true}
