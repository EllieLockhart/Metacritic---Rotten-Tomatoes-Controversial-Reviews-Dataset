Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely trash. Disney have ruined the Star Wars franchise for good. The film is filled with plot holes\\, terrible jokes and crap that makes no sense. The only thing it has going for it is that the set pieces are cool..","true":true}
