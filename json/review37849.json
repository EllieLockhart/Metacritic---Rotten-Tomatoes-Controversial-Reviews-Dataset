Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were things I enjoyed about this movie.... I know there were\\, but I'm so hard pressed to remember them.  The bulk of the run-time is manufactured drama and plot holes... which would make one think of it as the perfect sequel to the force awakens\\, but the two movies are painfully terrible in different directions in a manner that would be comically bad if all of the wasted potential wasn't so tragic.  Changing directors mid-way thru an arc doesn't seem like the way to go.","true":true}
