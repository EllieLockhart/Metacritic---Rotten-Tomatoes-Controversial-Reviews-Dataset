Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not sure why everyone hated this movie - I went in expected the worst and was so pleasantly surprised at how well done the movie was - it's not perfect - a lot of choices with a long history but I think he did a great job of decision making and I can't wait to see it again.","true":true}
