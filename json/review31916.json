Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoiler Free - \\nI wanted to like this movie so much more than I did. \\n\\nI don't find The Last Jedi particularly objectionable (except maybe Finn's flaccid adventure with Rose that's little more than ham-fisted social commentary on war profiteering). It isn't as soulless as the prequels\\, or insufferable as the Ewoks. It just never quite clicks.\\n\\nMy primary issue with the film is with the editing. It feels like a collection of scene starters that never manage to go anywhere meaningful. Conversations are all snippets. After too little time in one place characters dramatically move to a new set\\, or the camera cuts away to someone else's adventure. This attention deficit disorder keeps The Last Jedi from achieving any kind of emotional payoff. Most of the scenes are short enough to be inconsequential and never give you the chance to care about where you are at the moment. There's always the feeling the movie is impatiently waiting to jump ahead to the next scene. As Yoda would say\\, \\\"Never his mind on where he was. What he was doing.\\\" \\n\\nAnother side effect of poor editing is the resulting continuity errors. At one point\\, the bad guys are blowing up things at such a pace that\\, based on the scene splicing\\, everything worth saving would be gone by the time the heroes finally take action. And can I get a little sciency for a moment? Can someone please tell the creative minds at LucasFilms that if a space ship runs out of fuel\\, it will not slow down? Space is a vacuum. No friction. Fuel would be needed to slow down a ship\\, not to keep it moving at a steady pace. I could keep piling on\\, but not without giving away important story points.\\n\\nI do feel compelled to comment on the cinematography\\, as well. While there are many stunning visuals and some lovely scenery\\, there also were too many times when The Last Jedi had all the visual complexity of a single camera TV show\\, especially when we were watching real actors on sets. A scene in which Rey moves some heavy stuff using the Force was as compelling as a scene from Shazam! -  yes\\, the old Saturday morning kids show from the 1970s.\\n\\nUltimately\\, watching The Last Jedi is like watching a film adaptation of a really good first draft of a screenplay. Somewhere in there are an excellent story and interesting characters\\, but there's too much going on and way too many missed opportunities for storylines to intertwine\\, characters to interact\\, and the audience to commit to caring. A few more eyes and another draft (or three) might have fixed those problems by removing unnecessary characters\\, tightening up the action\\, lending gravitas to clutch scenes\\, and generally fleshing out what feels like a comic book version of a Star Wars movie.\\n\\nIt feels like\\, at some point during pre-production\\, someone need to take director Rian Johnson aside and deliver Luke's words to Rey from early in the film:\\n\\n\\\"Breathe. Just\\, breathe.\\\"","true":true}
