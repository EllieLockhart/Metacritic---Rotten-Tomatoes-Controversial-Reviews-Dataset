Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The humor in the film was unnecessary and so was Finn's character. They could have removed his whole story line (which was useless to the plot of the movie) and shaved off one hour of the film. Also\\, the toying of Kylo's emotions in the film seem a bit much...teacher tried to kill him can you blame him for getting upset?","true":true}
