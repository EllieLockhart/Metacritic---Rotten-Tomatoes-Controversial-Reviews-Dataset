Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wish everyone saw what I see in TLJ\\, I just don't get the hate. This film re-ignited my love for the Star Wars universe... I will be updating my review after a few more watches\\, I just want to put in my vote\\, as it deserves so much more credit than the audience score has given.","true":true}
