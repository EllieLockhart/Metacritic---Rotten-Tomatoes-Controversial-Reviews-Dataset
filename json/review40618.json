Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst Star Wars movie I've seen. Probably one of the worst movies I've seen. Plotholes everywhere and I felt like feminists were trying to shit in my face. It was god awful. Luke was totally out of character. This was a bad movie.","true":true}
