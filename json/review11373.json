Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible disjointed pile of steaming cr*p\\, the story is bad\\, the actors are worse and the only saving grace are special effects. The fact that this junk of a movie cannibalise its own franchise just adds insult to injury. And I'm no Star Wars fanatic by any stretch of imagination.","true":true}
