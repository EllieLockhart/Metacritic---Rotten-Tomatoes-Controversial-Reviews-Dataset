Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I promise that I will stop boycotting Disney the exact moment they apologise to the fans and admit they did a colossal mistake by hiring a manbaby with a huge inferiority complex to direct The Last Jedi. C'mon Disney\\, isn't this movie all about failure? Just admit yours!","true":true}
