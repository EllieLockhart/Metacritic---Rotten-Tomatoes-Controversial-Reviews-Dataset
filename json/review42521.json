Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was an absolute mess of storytelling and seemingly purposed to change the Star Wars universe to make some sort of statement (that nobody really wanted made--except Rian Johnson and Disney) rather than service and honor key character arcs.  So much has been said her and elsewhere about how this movie upset much of how the Star Wars universe works.  So much has been said about how absurd the plot and side-quest is.  I won't need to reiterate all these things here.  Others have fleshed it out far better than I could.  The only redeeming thing I have to say about this film is that it's nice to look at\\, but who expects a big-budget film like this to be filmed poorly.  Beside the cinematography\\, I have almost nothing else nice to say about it.  Rian Johnson made not just the worst Star Wars movie ever made--beating Phantom Menace by a long way--he \\\"subverted\\\" any expectation I had that IX will be something I'd actually want to see.","true":true}
