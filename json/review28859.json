Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really a big let down\\, I'm long time star wars fan\\, and really wanted to love this movie. There is just so many problems with this movie I don't know where to begin. So\\, I'm just going to reiterate what's been said before. The comical tones are improperly placed\\, the uninteresting side story of Finn and Rose where she forces a kiss on him and prevents him from trying to save the rebels is a big let down. I think Luke falling at some point is definitely plausible\\, but does it make for a movie that me or the fans want and love to see\\, not really. It's just sad to see such an epic character such as look who we last saw filled with hope and energy be so opposite. It just feels off. To top it off there is the odd Leia floating in space scene\\, the lack of any conflict with the primary protagonist Rey\\, and the sense that there is more political motives behind the stories premise that just leave you wishing this was something different.","true":true}
