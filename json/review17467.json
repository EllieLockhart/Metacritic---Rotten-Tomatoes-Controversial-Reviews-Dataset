Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw this Sunday night real expecting a lot. This new Twilight\/Star-Trek\/Disney barf parade was great! For stars though it was an utter disappointment. The questions i had were answer but in the most boring way possible. So many things didn't make any sense. If you're a true fan of star wars or star wars lore and backstory don't have your hopes up for this movie. If you're someone who doesn't know a lot about star wars or doesn't care then you'll probably really like the movie.","true":true}
