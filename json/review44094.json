Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ turns the galaxy's greatest hero into a hardened hermit... successfully. The space opera heads in a new direction with multiple twists as it develops its characters\\, both new and old\\, though the quality fluctuates.","true":true}
