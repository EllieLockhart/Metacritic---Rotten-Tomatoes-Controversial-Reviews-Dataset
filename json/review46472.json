Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was the biggest Star Wars fan since I was a kid.  I had seen all the movies and Tv series but this has ruined it for me.  \\nThe only way they could fix this movie is by remaking it...with a different director.","true":true}
