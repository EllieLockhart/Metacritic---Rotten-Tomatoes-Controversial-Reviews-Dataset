Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoiler Alert - To Kill off Luke in episode 8 was a MISTAKE! I have never criticized ANYTHING in any STAR WARS movie but when you think of STAR WARS\\, the first character you think of is Luke Skywalker! To bring him back in #8 just to kill him off was the stupidest idea ever. I can see it happening for episode 9 of course\\, to finish off the saga\\, but what is the point in doing it with another full movie left to go? I don't really care what anyone says to argue this point or justify it\\, including the director or fans of the movie..it was simply...a MISTAKE. Rest of the movie was okay. Adding the character of ROSE seemed forced and unnecessary to me. The character wasn't that interesting or important to the story.  Good job developing characters like Leia\\, Poe\\, and Ray and as always\\, special effects were good. They epic scene at the end where they try to shoot down Luke with all the fire power the First Order can dish out would have been a classic scene if it was actually Luke there..it would have been epic..but alas\\, Luke's character wasn't actually there and his development in the story is completely wasted considering all he has been through in the previous movies. In summary\\, an average movie in comparison to the other Star Wars movies and still fun to watch\\, but  a black shadow on the franchise for taking away Luke\\, who is the heart and soul of the 9 episodes\\, outside of Darth Vader. Live long in the Force Luke!","true":true}
