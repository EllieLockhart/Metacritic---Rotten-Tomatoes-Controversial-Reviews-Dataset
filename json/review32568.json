Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi honors the saga's rich legacy while adding some surprising twists\\\"\\n\\nThis is a bold faced lie. Last Jedi takes the broken pieces of the canon\\, smashes them in to dust\\, goes out of its way to ignore or undo the few things Force Unleashed set up\\, and throws so many twists that everything just ends up back at square one. RLM said it best \\\"This is wheel spinning the movie\\\"\\, they gave this movie to some guy who paid no mind to the greater story and left us with no where to go. This movie proves there is no plan. Watching Force Awakens and Last Jedi is like reading a round robin story from a pair of high schoolers who don't want to work on the same story and refuse to work together towards a cohesive narrative. In an objective vacuum where what came before and what comes next doesn't 'matter\\, the movie is alright. Just alright. As a part of a greater story\\, this is possibly the worst Star Wars movie yet.","true":true}
