Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"About a 1\/3 of the movie is a waste of time good characters are under used\\,  flawed characters are over used. Certain parts create plot holes and inconsistencies across the other films of the franchise. Ultimately the writer and director had know idea who Luke Skywalker is and how to portray him. A poor entry into the franchise that should be ignored. 1 star given because half stars don't count towards scores...\\n... so it won't let me give one star..   massive bias here ignore and scores about this movie on this site.","true":true}
