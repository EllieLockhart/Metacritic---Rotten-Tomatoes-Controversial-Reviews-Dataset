Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Perhaps the most disappointing movie of all time. The movie has a SJW agenda that leaves a bad taste in the mouth as it systematically undermines the characters and ethics of the original trilogy. The filmmakers attempts to subvert expectations end up hurting the film as they write themselves into a corner that they can't get out of. Why throw Princess Leia out into space\\, only to Marry Poppins her back to safety? Too many focus groups or lack of direction?","true":true}
