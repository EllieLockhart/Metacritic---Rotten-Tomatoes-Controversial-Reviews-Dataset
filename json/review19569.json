Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"ItThe Last Jedi allows its heroes to experience failures and make necessary sacrifices. The action scenes- of which\\, of course\\, there were many- were brisk and not\\, as many action scenes in Hollywood cinema have been over the last 15 to 20 years\\, edited to the point where they confuse the viewer. I left the theatre much like I left the theatre after Star Wars\\, as an 11-year old in 1977: Thrilled and realizing that my bladder was filled to the brim. I can't wait to see this installment of the franchise again.","true":true}
