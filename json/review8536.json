Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First half was very good. Fresh\\, rich\\, exciting\\, lot of twists. Very good character development\\, exceptionally good climax in the throne room. They should have ended it there. The second half of the movie is a complete ripoff of episodes V and VI. Nothing new\\, just the same old story\\, same old character tropes\\, same old same old... Dull and overused scenes\\, characters drop their development from the first half of the movie\\, everything's back in its boring way. They could have made something great\\, and it seems the intent was there in the first half\\, but it's like it got scratched forcefully to 'stay safe'. It wants to be something new but fails to capitalise on any of the interesting notions added in the movie\\, ending up a mess that delivers nothing. The movie goes down for me as a disappointment not just in context of the SW universe but in the contest of itself.","true":true}
