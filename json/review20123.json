Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It wasn't as bad as the force awakens\\, but it made me feel like I just got in a fight with my girlfriend and realizes I don't really want to be with her any more\\, so far the new trilogy is just terrible\\, Rouge One was great\\, instantly became my new favorite\\, even over empire. But this is horrible\\, bad writing followed by having characters introduced and guving no explanation about who or why they're there\\, and then just as fast get rid of them","true":true}
