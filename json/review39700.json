Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a film which has taken risks. So much going on and after a couple of days thinking about it. I think it's a fantastic film. Want to see it again  as soon as I can. I only marked it down 1\/2 A point as r2d2 isn't in it enough.","true":true}
