Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is just so much wrong with this movie. It seems like everything they set up in the force awakens was thrown out. They took one of the greatest loved characters of all time\\, Luke Skywalker\\, and made a joke out of him. The movie also seems to have some unwarranted politically correct undertones. Very sad. I was really looking forward to it.","true":true}
