Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"this is not going to go the way you think.\\\" So many people pissed off about an amazing movie. But yet so many pissed about how there years of theorizing lead to nothing. They don't owe us shit. Remember this is the second movie in the trilogy not the final one it's meant to set up the next movie.","true":true}
