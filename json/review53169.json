Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great great movie!  I've been a Star Wars fan since I was five years old and this is the movie that I've been waiting for.  It's visually gorgeous\\, the story is fun and the battle scenes are captivating.  It's The Dark Knight of the Star Wars Franchise. \\n\\nI am not sure why or how this movie only has a 52% audience score but I am going to assume that it must be non Star Wars fans scoring. \\n\\nAll I hope is that Disney and JJ Abrams keep doing what they are doing and not allow these non fans to influence the last and final installment.","true":true}
