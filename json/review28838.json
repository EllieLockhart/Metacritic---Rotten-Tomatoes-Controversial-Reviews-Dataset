Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"READ CAREFULLY: What makes Star Wars so great is the stories and  characters therein. They must have purpose and motives that can seemly be understood and hopefully achieved.  Each movie should progress the story and more of what was in the shadow should incrementally be revealed. That is story progression and makes for good story telling. This is not Marvel\\, DISNEY!!! its STAR WARS!!! Im sick of children prancing around all in their hormones and emotions. Where are the seasoned adults. I can not begin to stress the importance of following the rules of an EPIC!!! I sat in the theater watching people act foolish and excited over this rubbish of filth. Im DONE\\, the games are trash the movies are trash. Star Wars is dead for true fans.","true":true}
