But giving it such bad reviews is absolutely none sense.I find it brilliant\\, entertaining\\, emotional\\, depressing\\, hurtful and especially different. This game is not about revenge and it\u2019s moral message. It\u2019s about redemption and the development of Ellie as a character after what happened in the first one. The story really adds up. Just play it with a non-biased open mind and you will see. There are so many messages provided that you probably don\u2019t get them when playing it the first time (you might feel some of them though). The graphics are outstanding and rich in every detail. Each scene is well chosen and the sound gives the rest for a perfect atmosphere. It is really joy to play!! I also appreciate the incredible soundtrack with the emotional reference to the first one. It\u2019s a dark emotion though. But life in the TLOU world is that way. Which makes it even more realistic. Only criticism here is that it\u2019s a bit too long and the AI could be smarter.If you love the previous Naughty Dog games with its movie storyline gameplay you definitely should play this one too. If you are emotionally unstable and seek for open world or happy fun shooters\\, this one is probably not for you.Yes\\, the story could be different\\, giving it the chance to be like most the other games out there. But let me quote Joel: \u201cI know you wish things were different. I wish things were different. But they ain\u2019t!\u201dEnjoy the ride!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
