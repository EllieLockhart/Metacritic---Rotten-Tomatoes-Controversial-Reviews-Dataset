Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie was amazing! I know that many people have problems with it\\, but i thought that the new direction taken was very well done and absolutely necessary. The Last Jedi opted out of the focus on nostalgia and success that is so prevalent in the other Star Wars movies. This movie was about failure\\, and learning from those mistakes. It was so refreshing to see the characters that we all know and love fail\\, as it made the characters and their storylines so much more relatable and real.","true":true}
