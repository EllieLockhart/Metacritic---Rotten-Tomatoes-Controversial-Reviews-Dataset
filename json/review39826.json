Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a refreshing star wars film. This is not just a retelling of the same old story. It has a few weak moments and the score is less than great but the risks this movie takes with certain beloved characters is wonderful. It's time to leave our childhood's behind folks and grow up.","true":true}
