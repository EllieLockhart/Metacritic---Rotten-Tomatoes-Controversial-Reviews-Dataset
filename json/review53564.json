Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Except for good visuals\\, this movie is bad in virtually all aspects. The story is not exciting\\, all of the new characters are either dull or not pleasant\\, better existing characters are needlessly killed off left and right\\, half of those who are not killed off are acting entirely out of character\\, there is a relative lack of action compared to past films in the series\\, there were no light saber fights\\, and the kinds of twists the film offers left me disappointed rather than pleased.\\n\\nIt's like the carrot on a stick thing. They keep leading up to some awesome battle hoping you'll follow\\, but Whenever I thought we were about to see something good\\, they wanted to throw a twist in there so all you get is more disappointment. Needless to say\\, you never get that carrot.\\n\\nI advise you to skip this movie\\, and skip episode 9. This film has destroyed the trilogy beyond any hope of salvation. You should also skip the next trilogy entirely because it will have the same writer as this film. Actually it may be best to just stay away from Star Wars in general for the next several years\\, with no hope whatsoever of anything decent on the horizon.","true":true}
