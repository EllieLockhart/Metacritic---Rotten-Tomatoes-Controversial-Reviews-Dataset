Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The WORST star wars yet! The story is excruciatingly long\\, and NOTHING happens. The plot is boring and there are no duels whatsoever. All of the hype leading up to this movie is for nothing as major reveals turn out to be flat-out disappointing. After suffering through it all\\, the end of the movie actually makes the movie go from bad to worse. This makes AOTC look like a masterpiece.","true":true}
