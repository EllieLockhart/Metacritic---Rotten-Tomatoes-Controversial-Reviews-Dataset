Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing overall. A lot of acts within the movie of course serve a purpose within the movie itself\\, but otherwise\\, as far as the Star Wars Universe\\, really serve \\\"zero\\\" point what so ever. And HUGE mega-fan questions are left completely untouched. Like 1) who the hell is SNOKE? We never will find out\\, yet we were ALL lead to believe (and frankly wanted it) that SNOKE was a MAJOR player in all of this. 2) Who is Rey's parents? The movie teased at answering this question in a couple area's but we are still left with nothing\\, and there is NO WAY I'm settling for \\\"Rey's parents were just junkies who sold her off for a quick fix\\\"\\, that's unacceptable! 3) Who has Luke grown into and what will he do with Rey? Luke is an absolute inbasul in this movie in my opinion. He went from swashbuckling asskicker\\, always so charismatic an lovable - easily the star of the entire genre\\, to a complete baby-whining inbasul who spends his days pissed off. C'mon!!!!!!!! Frankly I'd rather Luke was dead .. which of course now he is. \\n\\nFollowing the Force Awakens\\, which was so amazing and fun\\, this movie -frankly- was boring\\, plodding\\, serving little point other than to kill off some main characters\\, and just ruined the experience for me.","true":true}
