Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a SW fan for 26+ years and have read most\\, if not\\, all of the now LEGENDS books and hold those as the official canon. They are so much better than what is being produced. This movie is awesome if you are new to the SW universe and no little to nothing about it or the EU. I fear the Disney Demon is turning this beloved series into a cash cow. Plain and simple. The story that was being set up in TFA was pissed away and discarded in TLJ. Where are the Knights of Ren? Where are Finn's injuries? Luke is hardly utilized at all. Hans death is mentioned for 3 seconds and that was it. WHO IS SNOKE? The revelation of Rey's parents are beyond underwhelming. This new director was an absolute horrible choice for such an iconic series. For the expectations I had and what was brought to the table\\, I can not rate this movie any higher than this. DISNEY! YOU TURNED LUKE INTO A MURDEROUS COWARD! WTF!?","true":true}
