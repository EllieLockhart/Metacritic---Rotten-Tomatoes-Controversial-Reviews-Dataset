Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An excellent installment with beautiful visuals\\, action and story. It\u2019s not my favorite in the franchise\\, but a great watch that expands the lore.","true":true}
