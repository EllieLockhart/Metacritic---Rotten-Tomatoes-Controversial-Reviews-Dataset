Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is a reason this movie is divisive. The writer\/directer took risks and ultimately created this film to challenge the audience\\, not pander to it. I love the complexity of the characters and the themes that permeate almost every moment of this film. While there are a few moments of cringe worthy humor\\, there are also moments that moved me more than any other Star Wars film to date. I love that the motivations and internal feelings of Rey and Kylo come through in their performances instead of being spelled out in dialogue. While some complain about the treatment of Luke's character I found it refreshingly human. He is not a paragon of goodness as in the original trilogy. If you want a straight forward good vs bad flick that leaves you feeling morally superior\\, go elsewhere. If you want a rehash of what came before\\, move along. If you want to be made to feel and think\\, then give it a role of the dice. May the force be with you!","true":true}
