ButThis is the first time I feel the need to write a metacritic review. Maybe it's the first of many others... Anyway.\rTLOU2 is the symbol of EVERYTHING WRONG with the gaming industry right now. It is a technical masterpiece\\, wasted by a horrible storytelling\\, tainted with the political agendas of the editors (no\\, sorry: POLITICIANS).\rThe developers\\, the actors\\, they're all so talented. But they all work for a company that disrespects them AND their customers.\r\rAnd then\\, there are the unanimous critic reviews. Apparently\\, this game is perfect\\, period. Anyone who lives (so\\, literally EVERYONE) knows that perfection does NOT exist. It just doesn't. So how come that game be perfect? It CAN'T.\rWhich just shows what is happening behind the scenes. It doesn't take a lot of braincells to understand. The critic reviews were entirely paid. You do know bribery is supposed to be illegal\\, right?\r\rAnyway\\, back to the game. It's so long it gets boring. It just drags on and on and on. At some point it feels like the end\\, but nope\\, here we go again for a few more hours.\rIt tries to tell a non-linear story\\, but the changes of time are so random it's just annoying.\rAnd the story... Dude! What have they done to my beloved characters??? Joel is extremely stupid\\, whereas he was a cold-blooded clever man before. Ellie is a monster for no other reason than shock value. Her bloodthirst is NOT justified by revenge. It's just not how humans work. People don't go on a rampage just to get revenge. That's a clich\u00e9 that just doesn't happen. It's a shame because TLOU characters were so realistic and believable. In this game\\, they're not.\rThe revenge plot is an overused trope\\, and TLOU2 brings NOTHING to that idea. But worse than that\\, the end of the game utterly DESTROYS the message that \\\"revenge is bad\\\". Yeah: they managed to fail a clich\u00e9 message! How can you be so incompetent?\r\rUnlike the positive reviews who pretend there's nothing wrong\\, I won't pretend there's nothing right. From a technical standpoint\\, again\\, it's a masterpiece. There are a few scenes that are actually good: the introduction that sums up the end of the first game\\, and some flashbacks of Ellie and Joel.\r\rTLOU is remembered for its beloved characters in a simple but effective story. TLOU2 will be remembered as the symbol of everything wrong in the current industry: games now are a marketing ploy\\, and the politicians that now govern the industry simply don't care about the game\\, nor about their developers\\, nor about their customers.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
