Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lazy writing\\, poor fan service\\, ridiculous Disney creatures. The plot holes and lack of continuity are numerous. No payoff for major characters - Phasma and Finn alone could be non-existent and there would be 0 change to the story.  One character becomes space superman while the other is in full blue-milk emo crisis. Again\\, no one seems to know where the larger story is going and have not paid attention to where it has been. Needless to say - disappointing.","true":true}
