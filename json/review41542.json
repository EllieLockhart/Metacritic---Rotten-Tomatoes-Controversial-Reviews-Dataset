{"101487":184624,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-03-19","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this MOVIE IS DISSAPOINTING ON SO MANY LEVELS. \\n\\nbut FIRST\\, LET'S STATE THE POSITIVES:\\n1- design\\, artwork\\, SCORE\\, VISUAL EFFECTS\\, COSTUMES\\, PRODUCTION\\, CAMERA WORK ETC. aLL ARE AMAZINGLY WELL DONE. \\n2- AND... THAT'S IT.\\n\\nnow\\, THE rotten PARTS:\\n1- EPISODE 8\\, LITERALLY DROPS EVERYTHING ESTABLISHED AND BUILT UP IN EPISODE 7\\, AND GOES ON TO ITS OWN DIRECTION\\, WHICH IS ACTUALLY IN NO DIRECTION AT ALL.. THE ONLY CONSTANT DIRECTION WAS WHATEVER SOCIO-POLITICAL ISSUE THE CREATORS OF THIS MOVIE WANTED TO SLAP IN THE AUDIENCE'S FACE\\, AT THE EXPENSE OF GOOD STORYTELLING. \\n\\n2- i DON'T MIND \\\"MESSAGES\\\" BEING SLIPPED IN ANY MOVIE\\, AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T DISTRACT FROM THE MAIN STORYLINE\\, OR DOESN'T GO AGAINST WHAT MAIN CHARACTERS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED TO BE LIKE. \\nBUT THIS MOVIE SHITS ON GOOD STORYTELLING\\, SHITS ON LOGIC\\, SHITS ON ALMOST EVERY CHARACTER (INCULDING THE HEROIC FEMALE CHARACTERS)\\, JUST TO LECTURE THE AUDIENCE LIKE BABIES\\, ABOUT UNIMPORTANT PERSONAL OPINIONS OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MOVIE. THESE FEEBLE-MINDED PEOPLE\\, JUST THOUGHT \\\"HEY LET'S BUY A BIG LOVED FRANCHISE\\, WHICH EVERYBODY WILL WATCH\\, AND DITCH ALL WHAT STAR WARS STANDS FOR\\, AND DITCH THE LOGIC OF THIS GALAXY FAR FAR AWAY\\, AND JUST MAKE IT INTO A PLATFORM FOR VOICING OUR PETTY LITTLE OPINION\\, IN THE MOST DISGUSTING ILLOGICAL FASHION POSSIBLE\\\".\\n\\n3-I AM ALL FOR \\\"EQUALITY\\\" BETWEEN GENDERS AND RACES\\, IN MOVIES AS WELL AS IN REAL LIFE. AGAIN I STRESS EQUALITY. EPISODE 7 DID A GREAT JOB\\, BY SUBTLY AND FAIRLY GIVING OUT IMPORTANT ROLES FOR PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT RACES\\, GENDERS ETC. I AM ALL FOR FEMALE HEROES\\, AS LONG AS THEY ARE WELL FONE CHARACTERS. AND IN A SAGA AS STAR WARS\\, WE HAVE PLENTY OF ROOM TO LIVE WITH THE STRUGGLES OF THE MAIN CHARACTERS AN VILAINS AND UNDERTAND THEIR MOTIVATIONS. EPISODE 7 ACHIEVED A GOOD EEQUILIBRIUM BY NOT SLAPPING PEOPLE IN THE FACE WITH \\\"AGENDAS\\\"\\, WHILE STILL SERVIING SOCIAL ISSUES OF EQUALITY AND FAIRNESS. BUT THEN EPISODE COMES IN\\, AND DESTROYS ALL THIS\\, AND INSTEAD THINKS IT'S BEST TO BREAK EQUALITY\\, AND SLAP EVERY SINGLE MALE CHARACTER IN THE FACE\\, INSULT THEM AND PORTRAY THEM AS WEAK (LUKE)\\, VIOLENT AND UNHINGED (POE)\\, COWARD (LUKE)\\, TROUBLED (KYLO)\\, MANIACS (HUCKS)\\, PURE EVIL YET STUPID (SNOKE)\\, INSIGNIFICANT (ACKBAR)\\, NO HEROIC ACTION ALLOWED (FINN).... WHILE ALMOST EVERY SINGLE FEMALE CHARACTER WAS PORTRAYED AS SOME VIRTUOUS SUPERHERO WHO IS ALWAYS RIGHT NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO: LEIA (SUPERMAN POWERS\\, WITH NO EXPLANATION) - HOLDO (SHE IS ALWAYS RIGHT\\, EVEN IF AS A FIRST TIME LEADER REFUSES TO SHARE THE PLAN WITH HER OFFICERS\\, BUT HEY\\, SHE IS A WOMAN AND HAS TO BE OBEYED WITHOUT QUESTIONING HER MOTIVATIONS)\\, REY (VIRTUALLY UNTRAINED IN THE FORCE\\, LEARNS VERY LITTLE FROM LUKE IN 2 DAYS\\, BECOMES THE MOST POWERFUL HUMAN BEING IN THE UNIVERSE)\\, ROSE (STEALS FINN'S HEROIC MOMENT ATTEMPTING TO SAVE EVERYBODY\\, BECAUSE SHE LOVES HIM\\, WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN SAVING EVERYBODY\\, BECAUSE REASONS).\\n\\n4- The first characters to be disrespected\\, were the female characters\\, despite the movie obviously pushing the agenda of feminism (not the Equality feminist movement\\, but the All men are stupid feminist movement). Since they removed any real struggle and arc from the main hero Rey. She didn't earn any of her powers\\, she didn't work for it. She was practically handed super powers\\, because the force needs to \\\"balance itself\\\" ?!? Since when the force works like that in Star Wars ? Luke had to train for weeks or months with the most powerful Jedi in the universe (Yoda)\\, in order to finally be able to summon a lightsaber from distance\\, barely. But Miss Rey\\, untrained in any way\\, somehow becomes this all powerful and virtuous being\\, just because of some silly mental bridge between her and Kylo ? \\nAdmiral Holdo\\, had the potential to be a good interesting character\\, instead\\, she was portrayed as this incompetent leader\\, who has poor communication skills\\, who refuses to share SURVIVAL plans\\, because she thinks that her Top officer is a violent asshole. Thus forcing Poe\\, who naturally thought she was crazy\\, as most the audience did\\, and hatched a plan to save the day\\, which opened the door to an unnecessary subplot for Finn and Rose\\, why ? because we have to fill in the Asian quota\\, and give her something to do\\, even if it didn't make any sense... because the writers are so incompetent\\, that they cannot even write in something that makes sense to the story\\, for the Asian girl... No let's give her the most ridiculous and long plot\\, and use this\\, to lecture the audience that War = Bad\\, War = rich men get richer... WOW ! what a revelation ! Oh\\, and let's also save the animals\\, because our friends who are about to die\\, can wait. It's not like these animals will be recaptured by the rich bad people anyway !! \\n\\n5- The movie is riddled by severe amounts of physically impossible situations\\, to count a few: Leia supermans back into a ship which has lost it's air pressure\\, then the door was open\\, and laws of physics get suspended\\, and nobody gets sucked into the vacuum of space\\, like what just happened moments earlier\\, when physics still applied ! \\nThe whole boring chase sequence made no sense\\, fuel conservation\\, mega ships unable to hit LASERS that far to hit the target ? Super duper mega ships\\, cannot go a little faster to catch up and fire at range? \\nSingle tiny enemy ship\\, able to distract mega super ship and its commander\\, by using bad phone line jokes\\, instead of Mega ship obliterating the tiny ship at first sight ? \\nEtc etc. \\n\\n6- Movie goes against all what Luke Skywalker stands for. The man who didn't give up on his father\\, the most evil being in the universe\\, and insisted on saving him\\, against all odds; freaks out because his nephew had some dark force brewing in him ? and considers for a few seconds to kill him ? what ? are you joking movie ? That's the reason Luke then fled away like a chicken ? Luke\\, who is established as one of the most powerful Jedis in history ?!? Have the writers even watched Star Wars ? are they aware of the Star Wars Lore ? I bet not. Because all they care for\\, is take advantage of the biggest Franchise in history\\, and lecture people about their personal opinions. \\nI would've loved to see Luke in a weakened state\\, and going through another terrible trial\\, which exhausted him; but for GOOD REASONS !!! Not for this lazy stupid reason that was slapped in our face ! \\n\\n7- I have plenty of things still to say\\, but this has been a long review\\, and there is still plenty; from unnecessary bad jokes\\, to horrible character motivations etc... But I shall stop here.\\nAnd I will Only ask Lucasfilm and Disney to please listen to your large fan base\\, those who actually watch the movies several times\\, those who buy all your merchandise; because the overwhelming majority hated this movie\\, and this means your sales will go down\\, and they have gone down. Instead of pandering to some niche audience\\, who would clap at anything that is aligned with their personal opinions\\, but would never watch the movie more than once\\, and will never bother to buy any of our merchandise. Think about what you are doing to yourselves\\, to this Franchise\\, to the fans. \\nPlease consider course correction; stop slapping personal social opinions in SCIENCE FICTION ENTERTAINING MOVIES\\, in our faces. Pass whatever messages you want\\, for people to ponder upon\\, without lecturing us like babies\\, and without destroying the storytelling in the process. It isn't that hard.\\nThank you","true":true}
