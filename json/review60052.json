We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"In 2016 when this game was announced. Neil Drukmann (the writer) said that the relationship between Ellie and Joel was the most important thing to remember\\, he said \\\"no one loves these characters as much as we did and the sequel would be about Ellie and Joel\\\". He even said \\\"he and the team had played games where you were other characters and they just didn't feel right\\, they pulled you from the main story\\\"... \\\"Part two will be about Ellie and Joels story and their relationship\\\". And he told the truth\\, for about 7 hours anyway! Trouble is the game is about 25 hours long!\r\rDon't get me wrong\\, the Last of us Part 2 deliveres excellent gameplay\\, great graphics\\, music\\, mechanics and phenomenal gunplay. However\\, the storyline was an absolute mess.\r\rSPOILER... They kill a main character and some won't be happy... including me. Now It wasn't great\\, but I understand why they did it. Yes it was upsetting\\, but it was a great driver for every emotion Ellie had and her continued journey. But then (and this is the real kicker). You are then forced to play the game using the character that kills the main character mentioned earlier... for the majority of the game too. It make absolutely no sense. Add into this that the this character is a lifeless and utterly dislikeable character\\, made worse by her actions in killing one of the main characters.\r\rSo the first part of the game (with Ellie) I thought was a 10\/10. But the rest isn't enjoyable at all and you are left wondering when you will get to be Ellie again.\r\rAdd into that the fact Naughty dog wanted to use the game as a platform to showcase every problem with LGBTQ issues in the world today. Again I have no issue with this being included in a game\\, but the sheer amount was too much. It ended up pulling you away from the main story and everything that made the first game so amazing and the platform it created.\r\rAlso Naughty dog lied in the trailer by cutting in shots of Joel from the first game into the trailer to make people think they were going to play with Joel more and no mention of the twist that everyone hates!\r\rSo at the end\\, after all the above. I haven't felt this cheated since the final season of Game of thrones!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
