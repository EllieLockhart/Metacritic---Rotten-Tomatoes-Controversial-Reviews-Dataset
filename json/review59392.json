By far the best looking game ive ever played to date\\, The gameplay is very similar to the first game but still really enjoyable. Where the game took a downturn for me was when lev and yarra are introduced. They were uninteresting characters and really bogged the story down and made those sections playing as abbey against the scars quite boring. I didnt mind playing as Abbey as much\\, I felt the worst for owens character\\, The end of the game was not satisfying\\, Ellie proceeds to make stupid decision after stupid decision and she honestly ends up almost the villian of the story. Overall tho I still had a blast ( for the most part) playing this especially the earl sections. A lot of heart and love went into this. The story ends up a bit of a mess but its not awful by any means and some early scenes even brought a tear to my eye.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
