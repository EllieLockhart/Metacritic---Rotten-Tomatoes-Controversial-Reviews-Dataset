Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All the things that had me looking forward to having unveiled from The Force Awakens for the last 2 years was disguarded. I left unsatisfied. This continues to move away from the Star Wars universe I loved and morphs into something different. I wouldn't have issue with that if this didn't act like it was continuing the story of the originals. We see the actors and props we saw 30 years ago\\, but I wonder if they are playing the same characters or just some parallel galaxy.","true":true}
