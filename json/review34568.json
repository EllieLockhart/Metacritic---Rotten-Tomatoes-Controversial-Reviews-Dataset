Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The biggest disappointment with this movie was the obvious disparagement between Rian Johnson and JJ Abrams\/Larry Kasdans vision of what Star Wars should feel like moving forward. Johnson basically threw up a middle finger and made the movie he wanted to damn with the lore. Shame on Kathleen Kenedy for not stepping in with the story group and preventing this tradegy of a movie. The only saving grace for thetrilogy at this point is that JJ can throw up the middle finger right back with EP9 and give meaning back to the characters we still have. ","true":true}
