Neil\\, you're not a good director.\r\rIt makes NO sense that Ellie act how she acts in certain parts of the game but that isn't even the biggest thing about why its bad. The reason is: character development. How do you make the player like her? Bring more and more backstory before she does what she did. Let the players play 2-10h as Abby when she was a child or whatever. The backstory of her is basically told in 10 minutes. That's it? And now I have to feel with her and understand why she did what she did? Hell no! That is weak story telling. Really really weak.\r\rThen there are all the other new characters. Nobody is likeable. Like really. They all feel empty. They are only shells without any meaning. This game is the epitome of the notion that \\\"graphics do not make a good game\\\".\u2026 Expand","true":true}
