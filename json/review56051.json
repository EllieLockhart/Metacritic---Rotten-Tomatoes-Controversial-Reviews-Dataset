Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So here it is folks. You're going to get the extremists of all shapes & sizes posting on here\\, so I'll do my best to not add to their numbers with absolute comments such as ''best ever'' or ''worst ever'' because neither apply in this case. Was this movie good\\, or worthy of being part of the Star Wars canon?  No. Was it worth the money?  Well\\, if you're ok with 2.5hrs of consistent plot holes\\, but some emotional triumphs along the way\\, then sure go for it.  I'm personally not a big fan when directors\\, screen writers and producers want to make a ''name'' for themselves by changing previously held core story & technology components of a movie franchise\\, but meh\\, if that's what it takes to sell more Disney toy products and attract new undiscerning fans\\, then so be it.  Long story short\\, if you're a fan of the original Star Wars series\\, you'll want to avoid this movie\\, but if you're ok with this movie changing character traits\\, mannerisms\\, and technological consistencies of past SW movies\\, then it's an ok adventure.  I'm also slightly disappointed to see that RT hasn't honestly reported the number of critics who didn't support this movie (you can see a few critics who scored the movie low\\, but ended up listed as a supporter of the movie)...","true":true}
