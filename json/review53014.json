Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a long-time Star Wars fan\\, I really enjoyed this movie. It took several unexpected turns\\, and it showed us the fans a new side of the Forcr that has \\\"awakened.\\\" This movie is not perfect\\, but it is darn good Star Wars.","true":true}
