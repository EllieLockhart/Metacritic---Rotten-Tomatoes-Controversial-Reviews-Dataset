Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a long time fan of the series I was very disappointed in this film. One reason you love the movies is character development and knowing their back stories. I realize they are working on new characters but they need to go deeper. Furthermore they made our beloved characters look like fools. Come on what is up with Luke and Yoda. ","true":true}
