Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Storyboard and dialogue (script) were terrible. Visuals\\, costume design\\, set design were great. It would immeadiately be a much better movie with half as many characters. Use that money for better writers. Good scenes were ruined by horrible scenes. Even the soundtrack was rushed and jumpy. Overall shows poor directing and lack of vision. C+ movie made worse by so much wasted potential.","true":true}
