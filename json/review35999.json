Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi reaches the depths of storytelling\\, pathos and imagination that haven't been tapped since the early 1980s. All of the storytelling and technical elements fire on all cylinders as Rian Johnson takes old fans and new on a roller coaster ride of emotions (which some may and will find unsettling.) He respectfully pays homage to the mythos and boldly expands on it to varying degrees of success.","true":true}
