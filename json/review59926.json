I hope someone can make good titles at the studio again\\, somewhere down the line. \\\"The New Dogs\\\" and \\\"Dr. Uckmann\\\" print should be discontinued. 100 Brains is a massive exaggeration by the way.

Just disappointed and embarrassed I ever thought this would be good.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
