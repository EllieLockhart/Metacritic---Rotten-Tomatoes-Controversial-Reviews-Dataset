Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Non-white characters are shoved into subplots while the main hero and villain have an inexplicable force bond. There are some gorgeous moments though\\, and the last half hour definitely helps boost my opinion of this film.","true":true}
