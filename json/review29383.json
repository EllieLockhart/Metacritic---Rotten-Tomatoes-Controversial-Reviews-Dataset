Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson delivers a funny\\, action packed movie with plently of twists(we all saw coming) but having a story with lots of twists and turns doesn't necessarily make it a good story. Most of the Story twists were predictable\\, and there is a big misdirect towards the end that just leaves you thinking AND wishing what could have been. \\nThe side quest that Finn and Rose go on is exciting and fun. Shows us a new side of the Star Wars galaxy we haven't yet seen. Unfortunately this side quest turns out to be completely pointless.\\nThe chemistry between characters are all great and play off each other very well. I do feel they played the \\\"Reluctant Hero\\\" card a bit too hard in the beginning with Luke. The long(2yr) awaited first exchanged between Luke and Rey was not at all what I expected and not in a good way.\\nTo sum it up\\, there are plenty of things to enjoy about this movie\\, its answered some questions but I feel we learned nothing in 2hr and 30mins. I will be seeing it again as I try to figure out where this fits in the Star Wars Saga.","true":true}
