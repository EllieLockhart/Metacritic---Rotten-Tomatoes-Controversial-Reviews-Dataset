Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Oh Disney\\, what have you done. There are so many inconsistencies in the story\\, the whole story does not really move forward\\, so many stupid story choices. Most characters do not develop\\, bad story arc. The childish humour does not fit at all. Most new creatures simply are not Star Wars. \\n\\nBottom line: some nice scenes\\, but in general a good example of bad storytelling. Disney Popcorn Cinema\\, but lacks any grandeur a Star Wars film lives of.","true":true}
