Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Upon reflection\\, I am not happy with this movie\\, or the franchise as it stands. Which\\, given my emotional and financial investment over the years\\, actually does make me sad. As a life long fan of the entire Star Wars universe\\, including some amazing games and books (which were largely\\, and unceremoniously tossed out of the cannon by Disney) 2 things: 1) most importantly\\, I agree with Mark Hamill - Disney has totally\\, and shamefully ruined Luke's character (and he's always been my favorite in the mythology)\\, and 2) certain aspects of the ending\/overall story were VERY poorly handled. In my opinion\\, it was enough to take the movie from being potentially great to being a visually stunning\\, but weak-storied movie with very serious flaws. At this point I'd prefer to think of Star Wars pre-Disney\\, when it was carefully and lovingly tended to by its creator\\, George Lucas. Now it's just a directionless hot mess being desperately tossed from director to director in an attempt to formulate something cohesive. It's not working.","true":true}
