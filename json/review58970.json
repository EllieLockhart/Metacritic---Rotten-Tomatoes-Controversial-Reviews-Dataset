Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Overall the Last Of Us Two is far from good. The game has state of the art graphics\\, animation\\, combat and mechanics. However the game is held back by the story and the way it\u2019s told. I have never been more unmotivated to play a game my whole life.  Some of the ideas for the story are ok on their own but are executed very poorly. If the gameplay had started with Abby and we where on a revenge mission but didn\u2019t know who we where going after\\, would have created suspense and conflict in the player as we would\u2019ve seen a character we actually liked killing our beloved Joel. However we still would have been like I just want to play as Joel and Ellie so either way the player doesn\u2019t like playing as Abby. Also the developers wanted to change to minds of players and show that good is a point of view. The way Joel died didn\u2019t sit well with me either. The whole point of Joel\u2019s character is that he is super careful and would always take it to the next level to protect Ellie as he felt a farther daughter bond with her and couldn\u2019t bare to lose that again. So why he just randomly trusted some stranger is beyond me\\, it\u2019s completely out of character. The game is also very politically and try\u2019s to hard to tell you the way you should think. By themselves the politics where ok but they build up and where to much to take. I have nothing against the issues\\, but when it\u2019s getting shoved down my through that I must feel this way and I must share the same opinion I don\u2019t like that. I enjoyed working my way though abandoned town clearing out infected. Or clearing out camps and posts of the Wolves clan. I thought the combat worked well and the mechanics worked well to keep the game running smoothly. And during the game you get to visit some places that look amazing! One thing about combat that could\u2019ve been improved was a slowing of time when you chose weapons I found to often that once I has bring up the menu\\, picked my gun and reloaded it the infected had a couple hits on me. Overall I enjoyed playing the game but found myself to often not wanting to play due to the story line and the bad characters and character development in the game. And it\u2019s a shame because to first one is one of my all time favourite games and it\u2019s a shame we had to wait seven years for this. The game has incredible graphics\\, combat and mechanics\\, and I think this had potential to be better. - Brett\u2026 Expand","true":true}
