Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"[For those in a hurry: Please see this incredible movie now.]\\n\\nThe Last Jedi has gone back to  what heroism is about: breaking self-fulfilling prophecies and defining your own destiny. They threw out the tedious tropes about \\\"the chosen one\\\" and pissed on cliched internet theories. Instead they have made an original film that has created new territory for every movie that will follow it.  \\n\\nMost of these 1\/2 or 1 star reviews are from fans who went into the theater expecting nostalgia but instead they learned that their childhood is over and that this is the year 2017. Of course they split hairs and justify their bias using plot holes as a excuse for their disappointment\\, but make no mistake\\, they simply cannot except change and wish to watch the same formulaic drivel over and over again\\, in a new skin.\\n\\nP.S. this movie is especially rewarding for people who understand symbolism and seek a deeper message when they watch a film.","true":true}
