Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Last the Jedi were able to awaken the nostalgia of meeting up with old familiar characters of childhood. This film is worth watching for the characters and a new story. Yes\\, the film sometimes can seem boring\\, but it's worth it.","true":true}
