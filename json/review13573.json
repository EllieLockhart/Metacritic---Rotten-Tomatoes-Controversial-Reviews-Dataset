Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I felt a great disturbance in the force\\, as if millions of voices suddenly cries out in terror then were suddenly silenced...
