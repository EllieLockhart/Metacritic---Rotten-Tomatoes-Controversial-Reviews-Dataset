Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After the abysmal failure of episode 7\\, I told myself I would not go and watch 8\\, but I did anyway.  Why?  Because it's Star Wars.  But this! This is not Star Wars\\, this is an abysmal failure of epic proportions.  How can you call a 2 1\/2 hour movie about a space chase Star Wars!?!?  How does Disney keep getting this wrong?  Don't get me wrong\\, it was beautifully made\\, great graphics\\, good directing\\, but a very poor story.  \\n\\nRian Johnson has hammered the final nail in the coffin.  This is not a Star Wars movie\\, it didn't feel like Star Wars\\, it didn't have the emotions or the powerful moments like the original trilogy.","true":true}
