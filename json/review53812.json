Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Han and Luke had to die because they were symbols of white masculinity and were replaced by a feminist\\, a hispanic and a black man. Even the hispanic who rightly staged a mutiny against his suicidally inept superior was made out to look like a hyper-reactive fool in contrast to the stoic purple haired female (read: feminist) Admiral who would intentionally leave details out of her plan that directly caused the deaths of thousands of her subordinates\\, but because she sacrificed herself to stop an army of angry white males\\, all is forgiven. Chewie becomes a vegan\\, Luke is a nihilist and turns out to be a would-be child killer\\, and Yoda returns from the dead to mock and deride ancient religious texts.\\nThe  \\\"Wise Matriarchy\\\"(just as authoritarian) vs  The Nazi Patriarchy. \\n TLJ was sacrilege.
