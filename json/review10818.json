Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hard to understand the path of the franchise from here.. The corny one liners were cringe at times and as a whole the movie lacked substance. The transformation from old to new is obviously a tough task and moving forward (if it happens?) maybe a more solid basis will take shape. The bond between Ben and Rey holds substance\\, but Snoak or Palpatine?! No brainer.. Just got to meet the character and gone! Where are the storm troopers? A smuggler or two and maybe a bounty hunter.. I don't want to live in the past but blimey use the tools that bought success\\, copy no but utilise them.","true":true}
