Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An excellent entry in the ever growing Star Wars saga by writer\/director Rian Johnson\\, who manages to create the most beautiful shots in a Star Wars movie and is able to write a very interesting plot about what happened to the characters of the sequel trilogy while honoring the veterans that came before it. Brilliant music by John Williams improving on his previous 'Force Awakens' soundtrack. Brilliant performances from the entire cast\\, Adam Driver and Mark Hamill standing out as the best. The film pays respects to the legacy of the original trio and pushes them in an unexpected direction that fans who are open to change will be eager to see. Not without its problems the film is boggled down by Canto Bight scenes\\, not by the ideas\\, but by the execution. Rian Johnson is able to create excellent ideas but sometimes struggles to execute them well.","true":true}
