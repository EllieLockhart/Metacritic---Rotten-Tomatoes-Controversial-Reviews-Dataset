Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney likes to pretend that all the people who don't like TLJ are male chauvinists instead of fans who would like to see more cool Jedi things or more space sci-fi stuff rather than 30 minutes of lazily-designed casino and space-dog gaming park. It looks like a casino gaming park on earth rather than one that's more sci-fi fantasy. Is Daniel Craig making a cameo as James Bond at the casino too? Why did Rian Johnson film the third lesson and cut it from release? I had to sit through someone whining about children working in a stable or her childhood and her poor dead sister instead of seeing the third lesson of being a Jedi! What?!? Look at KOTOR. Fans want more Jedi\/Space Pilot stuff not this 30 minutes side mission that didn't help or advance the main plot! I want to see more Rey kicking ass or the Millennium Falcon battling out of the armada. As unoriginal as the Force Awakens\\, at least that was cool. Even in the prequels\\, as bad as the plot was\\, none had wasted a quarter of movie on an useless side quest. And what a waste of talent for Kelly Marie Tran. Her character could have been a cool engineer and instead became one of the most useless and annoying characters in all of cinema like Jar Jar Binks. I feel bad for Kelly\\, Ahmed\\, Christopher\\, and Hayden. They don't deserve all the hate against for the badly written roles or bad direction.","true":true}
