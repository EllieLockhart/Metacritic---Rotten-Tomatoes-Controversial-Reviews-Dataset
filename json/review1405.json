Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a die hard fan\\, I was insulted. There were so many incredible moments that were ruined by poor direction and forced comedy.\\nThe originals comedy was light and gentle and didn't push you out of the world. Everytime I got immersed in the world\\, there would be a cut in the music and a unfunny joke. As a film it was bad\\, poor story execution and awful structuring issues; I mean Finn and Rose played no part in the movie\\, they accomplished nothing but adding to the screen time. Rian had no business directing in the first place. He only directed 2 major films. When Luke threw his lightsaber over his shoulder for a joke I almost left the theatre. I'm so glad JJ is directing EP 9. This is a film for people who like Star wars not for people who love it. I would rather watch Attack of the clones.","true":true}
