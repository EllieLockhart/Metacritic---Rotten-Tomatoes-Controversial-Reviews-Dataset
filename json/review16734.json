Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Initially the critics reviews had me really excited and I couldn't wait to go and see the film.. then of course I started to read the user comments & couldn't believe the slating it was receiving that immediately gave me a bad vibe going into watching the film.. now that I've actually seen the movie i can safely say that i thoroughly enjoyed it & can understand why fans would be divided on there opinion... simultaneously the Star Wars universe dies & expands leading me into episode 9 with a high sense of anticipation.. go into the film without reservations & doubt\\,it'll make for a much better viewing! Overall rating 5\/5","true":true}
