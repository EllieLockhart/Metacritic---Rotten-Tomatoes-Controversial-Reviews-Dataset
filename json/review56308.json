Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Story was terrible!  Who the hell wrote this story and script? Action was fine but it just wasn't Star Wars!  The story\\, character development was just weak.    I was hoping for so much with Luke\\, Reyes and other characters.  This production looked rush and acting was a bit cheesy.  Not impressed at all.  I was disappointed and think I could have a wrote a better 2nd story.","true":true}
