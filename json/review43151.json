Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This review has gone from 4 stars to 1. The movie on it\u2019s own is much better than 1\\, but it\u2019s story is the bruise on the apple. It\u2019s true. It ruins it\u2019s heritage and passes on a destroyed story to the conclusion. From the Phantom Menace to eight\\, you see the rise and fall of Aniken and Luke. The kicker was the last 5 episodes of the Y7 Star Wars Rebels show. Rebels gave us that magical feeling while making it still have a gut punch of a main character death. No way TLJ should trash the center of the joy for the last 40 years. At least in the prequels you knew Luke was on his way.","true":true}
