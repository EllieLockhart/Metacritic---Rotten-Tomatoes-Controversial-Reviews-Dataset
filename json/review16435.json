Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm sorry for all the people that didn't like this movie. I'm really sorry.\\nFor me\\, that didn't have any particular expectations\\, didn't know a single thing about the movie (I avoided spoilers at all cost\\, didn't even see any trailer) it was an enjoyable experience.\\nYes\\, it did have flaws\\, but I was able to surf above them and enjoy myself.\\nNow I reading reviews and I can't feel anything but sorry for how people have evolved when watching movies. There isn't any more \\\"I don't like this\\\". \\\"It's always they fucked it up\\\". :(\\nI do prefer to understand that I don't sail the ship. I just enjoy the ride.","true":true}
