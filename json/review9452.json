Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Going to hopefully give a solid review without any spoilers.\\nHere it goes:\\nGoing into the movie you have ALOT of questions we've been dying to have answered. Which if you're searching for any kind of answers to those questions..... forget it. This movie had a few pretty neat moments which is why i dont want to give it the absolute poorest score.  It seemed like the entire movie was running running running with a very poor ending in my opinion. You don't really discover much about the characters and if anything\\, you have MORE questions walking out of the theater. The more I thought about what I just watched...the worse it got. Being a longtime Star Wars Fan I have to say this movie was probably the worst. I seriously would take any of the prequels over this one. It's very disappointing. It hurts my soul that i have to rate a Star Wars Movie this low but this movie added basically nothing to the story. I'm hoping this isn't the future of Star Wars movies...","true":true}
