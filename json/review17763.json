Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It does not hold true to the spirit of the Star Wars universe\\, to much agenda dialogue and virtue signaling from the directors beating us over the head\\,  not enough storytelling. Hopefully Disney has learned its lesson if it wishes to continue to make money via the franchise.","true":true}
