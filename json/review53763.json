Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great characters reduced to plot points and no character development for the main characters has left me not caring what happens in Episode 9. For the first 2 minutes I thought I was watching the Spaceballs sequel. Silly space Mary Poppins scene. Slow space chase with fuel issues? The great Luke Skywalker reduced to a reclused coward. The franchise has been ruined.","true":true}
