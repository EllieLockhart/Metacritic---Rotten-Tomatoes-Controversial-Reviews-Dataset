Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is by far the best Disney Star Wars movie even after seeing the Rise of Skywalker. All the fans complaining that TLJ is hypocritical or surprising for surprisings sake simply cannot handle the truth that their fictional fan theories were proven wrong. TLJ is a wonder of storytelling that happens to be based on Star Wars. Of course\\, some parts of the movie like the canto byte sequence have no purpose and ruin the pacing\\, but on whole\\, the movie is quite recommendable.","true":true}
