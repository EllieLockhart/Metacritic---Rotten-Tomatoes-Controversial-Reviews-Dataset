Does the game deserve a 10\/10? No\\, it certainly could have been altered in minor ways to improve the storyline but these are only minor and any person who is able to suspend even an ounce of their belief in reality and immerse themselves in the story will find them negligible at best. Players who do not fully immerse themselves in the game's setting and story will find that there is a political agenda being presented to the players\\, namely related to feminism and SJW\\, however that does not affect the gameplay or story.\r\rUnfortunately\\, veterans of Part 1 have taken to the boards and bombed the reviews due to their frustration over key events and characters that represent the fictitious history of the Last of Us and feel as though Part 2 is not representative of the world described in Part 1.
