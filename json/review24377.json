Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mixed bag\\, took a few risks and did a lot of unexpected things but the good definitely did not outweigh the bad. Overall I dont think it was a good movie. Also unusually long and not in a good way. Was not digging the humor with general hux and leia reviving from the dead was too ridiculous for me","true":true}
