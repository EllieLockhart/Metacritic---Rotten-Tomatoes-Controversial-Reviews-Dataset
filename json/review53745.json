Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good movie that gets a lot of flack for being too different from the previous movies. The opposite was said of the previous movie \\\"It wasn't different enough!\\\". Some people will just never be happy. I enjoy the flow of learning about new abilities not explored via the movies. I enjoy the fact that there are force user in Kylo and Snoke that are not Sith\\, but use the emotion and hate to wield the force. I also like that Rey appears to be heading down a path that might be seen as a Grey Jedi\\, where emotion and a sense of right intertwine to a point that there is a balance of the force within her. She has feeling and emotions that she allows to shape her decisions\\, but also has the central idea of the Jedi path to be of service and assistance to those in need.\\n\\nAll in all a good movie that I'll enjoy watching over and over again.","true":true}
