So I was a MASSIVE fan of the original.  In fact it's the only modern naughty dog game I like.  So I was pretty hyped for this until the bomb dropped... Then I was worried and almost didn't buy it but on launch day I woke up and 20 min later I had bought it and started playing.The thing about this series isThis is a tricky one to review without spoilers but I think I can manage.  So I was a MASSIVE fan of the original.  In fact it's the only modern naughty dog game I like.  So I was pretty hyped for this until the bomb dropped... Then I was worried and almost didn't buy it but on launch day I woke up and 20 min later I had bought it and started playing.The thing about this series is everything that makes it good is story based.  The gameplay is very basic and easy stealth.  I can literally play on hard and get through every section using stealth kills and that includes the ones where they basically try to force gun fights.  So it's not the greatest as far as gameplay goes.  I'd give gameplay a 5\/10 which means average on my scale.Now the story..the potential saving grace of destroyer of scores.  It's both bad and good but unfortunately mostly bad.  Don't get me wrong\\, there are still moments that feel genuine and some dialog that is good.  The problem is it's far outweighed by genuinely bad writing.I don't care about genders or someone's preference in partner.  So that's not the issue so please don't even go there.  No...my problem with the story is it's just bad.  It's badly written\\, it's poorly paced and the important moments feel forced.  Basically things happen more for shock value than they do for the benefit of the story.In the original it was the story that pushed me to beat it.  I HAD to beat it as quickly as I could because the story had me hooked.  Without that being the case in this one I had to force myself to play which is why it took me till 3 days ago to beat it and then collect my thoughts on the whole thing.I hate it...I wish I didn't\\, I really do.  It's unfortunate really.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
