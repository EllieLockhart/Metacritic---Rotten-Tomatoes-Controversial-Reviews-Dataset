MAD\rThe story is very good\\, but if you can't get past THAT moment\\, you'll never understand it. Many people expected something else and when they got this their brain just went *puff*\r\rListen to me\\, the game is good. I'm giving 10\/10 only because i think it's unfair from us to take down a big work that took them 5 years to develop. It's not as good as the first\\, but i honestly think it's an amazing game\\, but you can fully enjoy it only if you played the predecessor.\r\rBtw about the gameplay: yes it's like 7 years ago plus some little new features... yeah\\, so is that bad? what you expected? a change like GTA from 2D to 3D? Guys\\, the gameplay of a sequel 99% of the times is the same as the previous game\\, it's logical. The new characters are good (not everyone is good as the older ones\\, but to be fair\\, even in the first one we had 2 elite characters and all the others were just good or average\\, nothing that good)\r\rStory: 8\/10\rGameplay: 9\/10\rGraphics: 9\/10\u2026 Expand","true":true}
