Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SHOULD BE called Star Wars The first mary sue!!!\\nAnd i mean that in its original first meaning\\, not its now bullshit sexist made up garbage.\\nThe worst movie ever with no regard to anything Star Wars!!!\\nShit fight Sceens lack of story telling etc.....etc.....Dont waste your time.\\npolitical propaganda bullshit!!!","true":true}
