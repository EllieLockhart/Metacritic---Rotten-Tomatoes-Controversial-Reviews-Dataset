Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a star wars fan. Growing up on the farm\\, we had two movies that i remember; Empire and Aliens. On sundays we would watch STO on the one local channel we could catch. This is my oldest love. I really want to love this film\\, i would love nothing more. I have watched it four times now\\, more painful each time\\, maybe just a little more numb to it. Johnson has made a beautiful film\\, no question. With gaping porn hole plot holes\\, near non existent character development and stunted undeveloped dialogue.  Johnson made a pretty film\\, but it isn't a star wars film. This pile of steamy wonderment exists to needlessly kill off and demonize proven heroes and villians\\, derail a story that had some real prospects for the sake of a political agenda. This is the first time for me where watching a sequel has actually made me question the validity of the previous film. To a point where i loved Force awakens and now\\, upon realizing anything and anyone in the first film i cared about doesn't matter\\,  I've never had a sequel make me end up hating both films\\, when i felt the opposite for the first. I didn't even know that was possible. Not a star wars film.","true":true}
