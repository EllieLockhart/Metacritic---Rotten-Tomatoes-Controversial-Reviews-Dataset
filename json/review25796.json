Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not bad\\, but not good either. I feel like you could skip this movie\\, go straight from episode 7 to 9\\, and not misss anything crucial. Way too much cheesy humor. Way too much cuteness. Very slow story development. Guess this is what happens when Disney is behind the production.","true":true}
