Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is rotten to the very core. It doesn't address any of the issues the original film presented (Rey's force powers without training\\, ability to fight\\, etc.)\\, but being gifted alone is forgiveable as it is a kids movie. This movie strikes a far worse blow to the Star Wars universe\\, there are numerous examples here is one before refute: this movie presents these new bombers (MG-100 StarFortress). it uses WW2 style bombing tactics which is silly by itself\\, but lets assume we ignore that for the \\\"cool factor\\,\\\" the real offense is that they have a hyper-drive! And\\, in this movie as we clearly see the frigate glass transport carrier which we are told is not capable of fighting use a hyper-drive to smash into one of the largest Star Destroyer\\, destroying it and several adjacent full size Star Destroyer ships (which just shows you the scale of the large one). This film therefore would suggest that the MG-100 StarFortress could simply be used as a fire-able payload\\, since it too has a hyper-drive it could simply be show at ships to similar effect.","true":true}
