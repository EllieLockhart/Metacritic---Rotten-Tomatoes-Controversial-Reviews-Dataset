Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it!  I thought it was the best installment since the original three and perhaps better than Return of the Jedi.  Storyline was great.  Luke was complex instead of merely veneer.  Well directed.","true":true}
