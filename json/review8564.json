Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First movie Ive ever actively hated. So many plot holes and problems\\, and ruins the character of Luke. Rey is still a Mary Sue. Rose is by far the worst character ever\\, makes Jar Jar look great. Leia Poppins and I could go on. I hate Rian Johnson\\, I hate Kathleen Kennedy. There is no hope for Ep 9","true":true}
