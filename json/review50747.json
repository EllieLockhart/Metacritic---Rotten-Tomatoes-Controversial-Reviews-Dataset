Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A bad movie with high production-value and a not so subtle political agenda. My most sarcastic thanks to everyone who helped to turn one of the most inclusive franchises in the world into this divisive garbage. Critic-scores just proves the corruption of the media-culture we live in. Good lord..","true":true}
