Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Here is how Episode IX can fix this monstrosity....\\n\\n1. Somehow write a living Snoke back into the story\\n2. Give Rey a better backstory than druggie parents\\n3. Dump\/kill off Rose immediately\\n4. Make Kylo Ren more badass and less whiny\\n5. Pair Poe and Finn up again\\n6. Give the PC crap a rest\\, REALLY!!\\n7. More droids and aliens to recapture what was cool about these movies\\n\\nThere\\, I fixed your mess Disney.  You're welcome.","true":true}
