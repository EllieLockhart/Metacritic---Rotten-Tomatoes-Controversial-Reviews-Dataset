Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney had the best franchise and all the money in the world. And what did they achieve? They made me not interested in Star Wars movies anyomre. This is very sad\\, but I will simply not show up next time. Just as the allies didn't show up at the end of the movie.","true":true}
