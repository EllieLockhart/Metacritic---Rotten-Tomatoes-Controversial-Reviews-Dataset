Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall good movie.. I don't get all the negativity on this one.. It was just as good as 7 if not better... Ray doesn't have to be from anyone of importance.. Anakin Skywalker was no one when they found him and he turned into Darth Vadar. My only issue would be with Snoke.. I think they killed him off to early and without a back story yet. I don't have a problem with Luke\\, he has always struggled with his commitment and lack of focus.. Remember Yoda  telling him there in no try ; Only do or do not.. Luke has problems when times get tough and is kind of weak emotionally.. Hense he broke down after his issue with Ben. I am excited and ready for 9..","true":true}
