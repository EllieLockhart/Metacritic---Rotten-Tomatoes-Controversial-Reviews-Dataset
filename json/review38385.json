Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst movie I've seen in theaters since the Flintstones.  You have to go back to Jason in Space to find a dumber addition to a once proud franchise.  Suicide Squad is better.  ORIGINS WOLVERINE WAS BETTER.  This thing is just an utter abortion.  Rian Johnson should be tarred and feathered.  DUMBEST CRAP EVER.  It's nothing to do with head-cannon and everything to do with terrible writing\\, acting\\, dialogue\\, plot and a stupid virtue signaling narrative.  Aside from 2 scenes its one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  Disney is absolutely hiring astroturf farms to spam the interwebs and promote this steaming turd.","true":true}
