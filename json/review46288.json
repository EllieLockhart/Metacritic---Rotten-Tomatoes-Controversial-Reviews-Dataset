Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"was a refreshing awesome and unpredictable film the first half has some weird or maybe slightly unnecessary moments but there was too much good stuff happening for the little bad to bother me. I love this film and would put it in my top 3 or 4 when ranking the star wars films\\, i feel like this was a much needed fresh move after The force awakens\\, and cant wait to see JJ Abrams wrap up everything and answer the questions this movie gave us","true":true}
