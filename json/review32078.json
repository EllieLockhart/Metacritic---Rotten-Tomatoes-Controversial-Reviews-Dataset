Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers:\\n\\nRian Johnson took a film franchise with so much promise and took a huge shit on it. The dialogue sucks\\, no world - building\\, Luke Skywalker is OOC major time\\, Snoke and Rey turn out to be nothing and the POC characters were given the worst story line and most unneeded one at that. The way they handled Princess Leia was completely wrong too. For the first time I can honestly say that a Star Wars movie sucks!\\nDisney I'll speak to you in the only way you understand: \\nIf you want a successful film franchise and you want MORE MONEY for the love of all that is holy FIRE Rian Johnson and never let him near a script for Star Wars again.","true":true}
