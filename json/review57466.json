Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was so much fun. I suggest seeing it to go have a good time. It was great to see Luke back in the mix. I don't get why there is so much hate on this movie. The first Star Wars was almost 4p years ago. I'm just happy they are trying to introduce this story to the new generation. It's definitely a Star Wars type movie with a millennial twist. \\n\\nGreat job\\, go see it. Keep an open mind. I hope they keep making more movies. It wasn't boring. It was fast and fun. Kylo Ren was half right. I don't agree with killing the past\\, but moving on from it is what this movie is doing. At the same time it's still paying homage to the story of the past. It's so cool. Go see it\\, have a good time. You won't regret it!!! Awesome movie!!!!","true":true}
