Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie ever\\, debatable if it is better than episodes I\\,II\\,and III. It lost key elements that made this franchise an immediate Fan favorite. Several plot lines dont get a chance to mature\\, causing a disengaged feel to the movie. I wouldnt watch it even if it was on TV\\, without commercials.","true":true}
