Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn\u2019t think there was any way I wasn\u2019t going to like this movie. I walked away very disappointed; only way to describe it. What could have been one of the best movies in the franchise ranks near the bottom imo. I can\u2019t get over how bad they dropped the ball.","true":true}
