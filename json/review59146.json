We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Here's how they could have fixed the game...\r\rHe (Joel) had A Thing that he didn't like people\\, He didn't trust people. So why would he go \\\"I'm Joel\\\" Like we lost that character. I think if Ellie would have walked in and say \\\"Hey Joel who are your friends?\\\" Or something like that\\, then maybe people would look at it differently. Like picture this.\r\rEllie finds Joel and says \\\"Hey... Who are your new friends Joel?\\\" in a laughing tone. Then they same thing happened. Sept they Hold Ellie down... Then actually shoot Joel\\, Instead of torturing him. Then sure Ellie would have gotten revenge. (KINDA LIKE THE GAME) Sept the ending is different.\r\rShe actually stabs\\, Abby (The most hated game character) Then Ellie would take care of the kid (for d.l.c if they did that) Then Ellie trains that kid to be better than Ellie\\, Ellie would train Lev to be better than Abby\/Ellie. Sure the kid would see Abby dead (He'd wake up) But he would have Learned that's Life\\, BECAUSE After Ellie saw Joel die she learned. That's a part of life and You have to live with that. That would have been a better ending\\, that's just me tho. Then after that they work on a part 3. Pretty **** simple.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
