Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I watched Star Wars: The Last Jedi with the expectations higher than the sky itself. I was amazed to find the twists and warmth you feel when watch a classic Star Wars movie like Empire Strikes Back. Although Luke Skywalker had a few great moments one especially\\, he was a grumpy\\, old\\, and just different from the Luke we remember. Luke did have great moments and with more than five seconds of screen time like the Force Awakens he showed us that Luke is still the best Jedi ever. In the movie Rey was a conflicted person not knowing who to go to. Rey was more trying to find herself than in this movie than trying to beat Kylo Ren like in the last movie. Poe Dameron however was amazing and was like watching Han Solo. In all\\, the characters all had an interesting plot line and I would see it again and so should you.","true":true}
