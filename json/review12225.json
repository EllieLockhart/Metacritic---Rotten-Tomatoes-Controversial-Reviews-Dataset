Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am happy that Rian took a risk on this one. What it comes down to is the reasons he made changes were not explained or justified other than to just be different. This movie was a hot mess and I will not be returning to a movie theater to see another Star Wars film.","true":true}
