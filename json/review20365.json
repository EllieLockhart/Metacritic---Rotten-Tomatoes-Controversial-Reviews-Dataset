Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It will never beat Episode V\\, but this is the second best Star Wars movie. Others will EXPECT a predictable plot\\, but Rian Johnson did justice.\\nMark Hamill\\, you deserve an Oscar!","true":true}
