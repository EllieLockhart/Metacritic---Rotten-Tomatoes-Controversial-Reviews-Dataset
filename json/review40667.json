Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is why I never trust critic reviews when I\u2019m looking at movie reviews. Did I watch the same movie as them? The movie just dragged on as a space police chase. Luke trained with Yoda and it still took him years to become a powerful Jedi. Rey follows Luke around and whacks him with a metal rod and all of sudden is a strong force user. The whole casino story plot was dumb and uninteresting. They made a big deal about Rey\u2019s parents and then made them junk dealers. Luke basically turns into a whiny bum and Kylo Ren is still emo asf. Princess Leia flying through space was cringey. The jokes were over the top\\, cheesy\\, and out of place in Star Wars. I felt like I watched Harry Potter meets marvel\\, mixed with a little bit of Star Wars. Rian Johnson shouldn\u2019t get 3 more Star Wars movies.","true":true}
