Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What\u2019s up with the haters? This movie was so starwars\\, so fun and well acted and directed and not predictable. People are mad because their own theories were wrong and they feel stupid instead of pleased when they are surprised!","true":true}
