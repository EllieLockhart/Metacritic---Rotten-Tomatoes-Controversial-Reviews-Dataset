Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought the special affect where amazing but that is not what makes starwars great! The Characters and story\\, as well as plot is what makes the film great. Rian Johnson wrote the worse screen play story ever made in his career. This is really to bad because he is a great movie director that screwed up Starwars!!!","true":true}
