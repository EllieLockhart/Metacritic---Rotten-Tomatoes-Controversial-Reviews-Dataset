{"101487":113966,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-31","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(Contains some SPOILERS)\\nIt's beautifully crafted and acted. It looks and sounds amazing. The characters are (mostly) interesting and relatable\\, leading to the film having a lot of emotional weight. There are some controversial plot points. It might be a little too long\\, and a certain \\\"side-quest\\\" sequence in the middle falls a  little flat.\\nHowever\\, the film is very unpredictable and therefore thrilling. A lot of fans seem to think that it's too unpredictable\\, and that it strives too far from what Star Wars should be in their opinion. The film takes a lot of risks\\, which is refreshing\\, after Episode 7 didn't bring much new to the table story-wise. \\nA lot of Star Wars fans seem to only like \\\"surprises\\\" when they can see them coming. The Last Jedi doesn't bring much fan service. In fact\\, Rian Johnson was not interested in fan theories about Rey\\, Snoke etc. (and why should he be?). I don't think it's legit criticism if you're mad that the story didn't go the way you wanted it to go.\\nIt's apparent however\\, that there wasn't really a single vision for these films. Johnson doesn't pick up on certain points that were set up in Episode 7. Sometimes\\, these choices work (would it have been shocking to anyone if Rey turned out to be another Skywalker\\, or even a Kenobi or something?)\\, at other times it might feel unsatisfying.\\nThe Last Jedi is risky\\, and not all of it works. But it's refreshing\\, ambitous\\, bold and beautiful.","true":true}
