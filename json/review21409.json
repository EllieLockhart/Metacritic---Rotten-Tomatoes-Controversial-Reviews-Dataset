Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wish I were more surprised at the divide of the audience scoring\\, but I'm not.  STAR WARS: The Last Jedi is a Good Movie.  Thought provoking\\, and underneath the fierce action and spectacular scenery - it's sad.  Really sad.  And... it does what real life would do with the sort-of constant tragedy: It just drives on.  And\\, as all good movies\\, do - it does unexpected things.  Surprising things.  And weirdly\\, I think fan boys hate surprises.  Because they apparently would rather show off their opposition to anything they didn't think up themselves\\, than allow for a story they didn't think of to unfold.  Anyway:  Really really really go see this movie.  It's really good and really brave.  Don't let someone else's burnt sense of irony joyrob you from this film.","true":true}
