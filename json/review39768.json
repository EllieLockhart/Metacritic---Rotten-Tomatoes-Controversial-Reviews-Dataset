Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a movie that brings a lot of potential to the Star Wars saga! Rian Johnson was a little bit disrespectful towards the previous directors writers and the saga itself but it will ultimately lead to some great new films. Daisy Ridley is the best btw","true":true}
