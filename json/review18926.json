{"101487":142515,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-09","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a Trap! Star Wars The Last Jedi is not a good movie\\, and it's treatment of the rich history and fandom of Star Wars is offensive. Somehow the move managed to crap all over the prequels\\, the original trilogy\\, and even the latest in the series\\,The Force Awakens. I hold Rotten Tomatoes personally responsible for my wasted afternoon seeing this movie as their aggregate critic score was somehow in the 90's when I checked before seeing it. Yes\\, the movie has a diverse cast of talented actors\\, great cinematography\\, fantastic special effects\\, and an amazing musical score. For what they were asked to do\\, much of the cast even put in good performances\\, and I feel especially bad for Mark Hamill as he had to desecrate a character he had invested so much into\\, a character that stood for never backing down\\, never giving up\\, believing in the goodness in others and in keeping hope alive even in the worst of possible times. Luke Skywalker is a character that has been with many of us since we were children. The directing was even good\\, as how else could you squeeze decent to good performances out of actors\\, and actresses that did not believe in the story (per several Mark Hamill interviews\\, and Daisy Rider even expressed concern that her character was not with Fin in this movie. The fault lies in the terrible script this movie was based on. The Script was especially poor in regards to how it did not continue the story started in The Force Awakens. Now if this movie was for 10 year olds and younger\\, I think they will love it\\, so it does have some value there\\, however\\, for rational adults\\, this is a very poor experience.  Some quick thoughts on the story or lack of story. Rey is Jesus in this movie\\, she is the best Jedi who has ever lived\\, and needs no training\\, even without training she is superior to Luke and has nothing to learn from him in their training sessions\\, except how to milk a thala-sirens for some tasty blue milk which Luke drinks like a drunk with delight. Rey has no personality or driving factors\\, she nearly falls in love or has a romantic relationship with Kylo Ren\\, a man who killed her mentor Han Solo\\, almost killed her and severely damaged her best friend FIn in a fight. Luke\\, on the other hand is a miserable old broken down man\\, who has disconnected himself from the force\\, because he almost killed Ben Skywalker while Ben was sleeping as he sensed the dark side in Ben. Yes that Luke Skywalker who saw good in Darth Vader\\, almost murdered his nephew\\, a boy he would have most likely held as a baby and most likely helped raise Ben\\, and surley trained him as a Jedi. Now for most\\, they went to see The Force Awakens in a big part for the new characters\\, but surely for the old\\, and for no-one more than Luke Skywalker. George Lucas has gone on record as stating Luke is the most powerful Jedi that ever lived\\, so most fans were really looking forward to seeing what he could do as a more aged\\, wizened\\, master in the Last Jedi as it would surely be even more impressive than the Yodi and previous Luke feats we had seen in the past. In the end Luke force ghosts himself across the galaxy to buy some time for a retreating rebel fleet\\, has a very brief ghost battle with Ren\\, and then dies as a lonely\\, broken down fool on his island of solitude. Chewie was just used for a lame bird eating joke. Poe Dameron disobeys orders on an attack run\\, gets demoted\\, and then performs a failed coup to take over the Rebels\\, afterwards\\, a new Character Amilyn Holdo (purple haired Rebel leader lady)\\, after the failed Coup against her leadership by Poe\\, apparently thinking it is cute say's\\, \\\" I like him\\\" in a dismissive way as she talks with Leah. Leah uses the force to float throw open space (Like Mary Poppins) right after her ship is destroyed in a First Order Attack that also kills Admiral Ackbar. After that Leah does not do much. One of the rebel ships at one point is used to destroy a whole First Order ship armada like a hot knife through butter on an almost out of fuel jump to hyperspace kind of thing\\, (why not just use that tatic all the time to destroy whole fleets). Fin meets up with a new character\\, and in the middle of a space chase they go off to a Space Casino to learn about how Capitalism is bad\\, and animal and child abuse\\, (they save the animals\\, but not the children). Later when he tries to sacrifice himself to save all the rebels\\, the new character Rose stops him because she loves him (meanwhile most likely dooming\\, her\\,  Fin\\, and all the Rebels to certain death)\\, while at the same time honors her sister\\, who sacrificed herself earlier in the movie to take out a First Order ship. This is just some highlights\\, their are many more plot holes and parts of the story that do not fit (Snoke lack of use and development\\, little bird creatures\\, Captain Phasma lack of use\\, Who Rey's parents are\\, Yoda strange scene\\, ect.). I believe that the director and Disney were trying to create a great movie with many compelling female leads\\,\\, and that is admirable\\, however\\, they still created a terrible movie that does a disservice to the fans\\, did not continue the story\\, and did nothing bold and surprising other than be incredible lazy and careless with the script and editing of this movie. I like surprises in movies and plot twists\\, but this was not that. I understand that Disney is a very large enterprise owning news agencies\\, media\\, and entertainment companies\\, but I can't help but think they used their large heft to color these reviews to make a profit. I like Disney as much as the next person\\, (Their parks\\, Pixar is fantastic\\, related toys and merchandise\\,I have really enjoyed the Marvel movies\\,  ABC\\, A&E\\, ect)\\, but in this regard\\, I am very disappointed that they made a bad movie\\, and somehow impacted this movie being reviewed by the Critics as much better than it was and that is unfortunate\\, but at least I can do my part by sharing in Audience score\\, and I am greatfull for that.","true":true}
