Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Utter garbage and insulting to the intelligence of any Star Wars fan. Makes a mockery out of the original movies and in order to push a clear political agenda\\, and more importantly\\, sell stuffed animals to children. Even worse than the lowest point of the prequels.","true":true}
