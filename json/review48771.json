Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst movie of all time! Screw Disney and the idiots that have made episode 7 & 8. Let Timothy Zahn and other great writers from the EU write these scripts for these movies as these movies are ABSOLUTELY terrible!","true":true}
