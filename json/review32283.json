Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars fans will hate this\\,  it completely destroys all lore\\, history and the soul of the franchise.\\n\\nNon fans will also hate this because the writing is horrible\\, scenes are cringe worthy\\, the humour is beyond bad\\, and the plot has way to many idiotic holes.\\n\\nNothing interesting\\, exciting\\, groundbreaking\\, just a massive dud. This director will single handedly ruin was was once great if they let him continue. JJ Abrams at least kept the heart going\\, Rian Johnson is basically a loser.","true":true}
