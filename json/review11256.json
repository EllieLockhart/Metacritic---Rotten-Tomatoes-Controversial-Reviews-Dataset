Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly seems like those involved were determined to dismantle the entire legacy of the original trilogy while at the same time stealing as much as they could from those movies to try to sell their new 'vision'. Bassically a combination of zero respect for preexisting fans or source material combined with a total lack of original ideas\\, good acting or decent writing. Throw in some very blatant political agendas (anti-Trump\\, radical feminism) and you have something that will retain its lukewarm appeal only as long as the sociopolitical agenda that drove it remains in play.","true":true}
