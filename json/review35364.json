Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The key to this film is that it's NOT going to help you relive your childhood. If you're going into this film expecting that... you're going to be disappointed. This film plays around with the pre-established lore and presents us with an excellent sequel to The Force Awakens. \\n\\nHonestly... this film is going into my top 4 or 3 Star Wars films\\, definitely scooting in above TFA.","true":true}
