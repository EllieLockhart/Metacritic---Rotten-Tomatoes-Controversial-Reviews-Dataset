Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was more written and directed to appease the critics and not the long time fans.  As a standalone movie it was good but as part of the whole Star Wars whole it just didn't fit.","true":true}
