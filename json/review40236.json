Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not the sequel you're looking for. No\\, in all seriousness\\, this could could have been a standalone installment. It did nothing to build on what Force Awakens started. It's a fun ride\\, don't doubt that it is\\, but it doesn't lead anywhere and leaves you fairly unfulfilled if you're looking for the main story arc in between action and pretty scenery.","true":true}
