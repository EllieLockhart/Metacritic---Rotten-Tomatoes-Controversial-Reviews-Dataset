Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the worst film I have ever seen\\, and I seen a lot of rubbish. The director should never work again. There is so much wrong with this movie I would need a week to detail everything that was wrong.","true":true}
