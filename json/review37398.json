Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The problem with this new set of Star Wars movies is that I just don't care about any of the characters at all. Poe Dameron has to be the least complex major character in a movie in history. Rey and Finn are also suitably bland and no one has an interesting story. This movie also swerved into the big mistake of the prequels: too much CGI. The scenes on the casino planet are basically just a cartoon. Do they live? Do they die? Frankly\\, I couldn't care less.","true":true}
