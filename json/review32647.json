Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars the Last Jedi is full of terrible lines (I can't even call it monologue because their sentences are so broken up and just cringy) It also has so may plot holes and unthought out story or just terrible logic\\, It also has a lot of forced comedy that a lot of the time just doesn't fit the characters. Although has some great comedy as well. The movie is an enjoyable movie but is most certainly not worth 93% score and doesn't compare to some of the other movies this year.","true":true}
