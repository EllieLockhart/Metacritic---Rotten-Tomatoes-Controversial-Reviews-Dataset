Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It had some visually great scenes\\, hands down. But that's pretty much it\\, the story just didn't seem right for a Star Wars movie\\, nothing seemed right to me\\, very disapointed in the plot\\, and for being such a long movie it felt kind of empty. Hoping they can make up for it in the next one.","true":true}
