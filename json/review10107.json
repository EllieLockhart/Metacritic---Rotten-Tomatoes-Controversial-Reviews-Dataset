Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great Movie.  Been a Star Wars fan since I was 7 in 1977. I view it as a Star Wars movie with no expectations and I really enjoyed the take on this new film. I thought Hamill's work was Oscar worthy. I also loved how they took the force and pushed it.  Well done!","true":true}
