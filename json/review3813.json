Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Biggest disappointment of all time. They never understood that it's part of a saga and they changed everything! Luke isnt Luke\\, Leia isnt Leia\\, Yoda isnt Yoda...the Movie isnt a Star wars movie!! So stupid! leia flying like Mary Poppins? Coward Luke defeated by Rey? Snoke defeated easily by Kylo? BB8 driving an AT-ST? and the most boring SW scene with Rose and Finn. Really its the worst and stupid Star Wars story i have seen. Kathleen Kennedy\\, JJ\\, Ryan and Hidalgo ruined Star Wars.","true":true}
