Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not the movie I was looking for\\, Placid Star Wars Movie\\, New characters\\, weapons\\, vehicles are almost non existant\\, barely tells the star wars story and definitely does not have a very climatic feel to it\\, overall just a story put to paper that could have been done in any universe.  Played out plot\\, characters and humor.","true":true}
