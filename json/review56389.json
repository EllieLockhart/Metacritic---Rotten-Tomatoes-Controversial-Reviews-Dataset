Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Tfw most of these audience reactions are bots or spam.\\n\\nAnyways\\, I was really hyped to see this movie. After watching The Force Awakens\\, I was ready to see this movie. Well\\, I did and the results are better than The Force Awakens. First\\, the visual effects are improved from the TFA. TLJ's visual effects from explosions\\, to motion capture\\, they are excellent. I definitely liked the effects after Holdo \\\"light speed kamikaze\\\" against the Star Destroyers. The characters are on the bland side. I do like Luke\\, Leia\\, Rey\\, Kylo\\, Snoke\\, Finn and Poe. But\\, some of these new characters like Rose or Holdo lack character development and are eh characters. The plotline is better than TFA\\, rather than fighting over some map (btw who the hell created that map?) This plot involves the Resistance escaping from The First Order and Rey on Ahch. While most of the plot is good\\, some of it involving Finn and Rose on Canto Bright doesn't need to be 20+ minutes long. Rian could've easily cut some parts on Canto Bright. The action sequences are spectacular especially the scenes on Crait and Snoke's Throne Room. I really enjoyed the duel between Rey + Kylo against the Praetorian Guards. While\\, Finn and Phasma's duel was rather disappointing and too fast. The acting of this movie is really good. Mark does a good job with his role. Adam and Daisy also do a good job with their roles. I like the humor of this movie\\, funnier than TFW. From Poe and Hux\\, to Porgs\\, most of the humor is amusing and hilarious. And last but not least\\, the plot holes\/plot twists. Some of these are really shocking including Leia using the force through space and Kylo killing Snoke. Luke trying to kill Kylo however\\, I don't buy it. Also\\, I think there are too many of them like the boy using the force at the end. But whatever.\\n\\nEnd Score: 4\/5\\nThe Last Jedi was an improved entry from The Force Awakens. Highly underrated by fans\\, I recommend re-watching.\\n\\nEdit: Re-watched the movies a few times and it is terrible. Still better than TFA\\, but just barely. I'm glad TROS saved this trilogy.","true":true}
