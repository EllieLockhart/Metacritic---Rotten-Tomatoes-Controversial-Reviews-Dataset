Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lifelong Star Wars fan who has been steeped deep in the Old EU\\, this was a masterfully done next chapter in the saga. We got real growth and development from these characters who have to struggle with their mistakes and failures and then learn to be stronger.","true":true}
