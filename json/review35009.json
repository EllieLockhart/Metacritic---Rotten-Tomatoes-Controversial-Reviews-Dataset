Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film was terrible. luke Skywalker was turned into a grumpy coward  Rey has no sense of progression she just picks up a lightsaber and within 2 seconds beats luke Skywalker and kylo. The whole film was a political statement and a absolutely terrible film","true":true}
