Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi takes a bold new stand in the Star wars mythology\\, It is basically about the rebirth of the Jedi in a time of darkness\\, it is in essence a character driven film with great action set pieces.","true":true}
