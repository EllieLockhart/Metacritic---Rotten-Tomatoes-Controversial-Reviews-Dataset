Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best Star Wars films! After seeing the movie twice in theaters and really looking for reasons why some viewers didn\u2019t give great ratings\\, I\u2019m still baffled. I liked it even more the second time. This is one of the best Star Wars movies without question. The final battle scene is a work of art...the way the Luke scene was shot with the subtle hints that he\u2019s not physically there was spectacular. I think Star Wars \u201cfans\u201d need to take a second look and give this film the score it deserves. For once in my life I agree with the critics.","true":true}
