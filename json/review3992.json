Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"boring plot with lackluster character. \\n\\nI can't believe that such a loved series like star wars had such a terrible movie. I loved the force awakens and its characters but I have no idea what went wrong here. \\n\\nI do not recommend watching this to anyone and its probably one of the most disappointing movies of 2017.","true":true}
