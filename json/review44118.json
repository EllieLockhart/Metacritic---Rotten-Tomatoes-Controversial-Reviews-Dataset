Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To all the complaining fans: You would have hated anything that came on that screen. By the time the movie came out\\, you had already written\\, shot\\, edited\\, and watched it in your head. They couldn't have won. You already decided what that episode was and when it wasn't \\\"your\\\" Star Wars\\, you threw a fit.\\n\\nI thoroughly loved how exciting and adventurous this movie was. It came out of left field like just like the \\\"I am your father\\\" scene from Empire. I am certain that if the internet was around when the original trilogy came out\\, fans would have also lost their minds and mobbed the reviews. This film will hold up and the professional reviews have proved that","true":true}
