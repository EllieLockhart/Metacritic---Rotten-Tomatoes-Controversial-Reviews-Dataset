Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I speak 6 languages and I can't find appropriate words to describe how bad it was. Just bad. Bad jokes with the worst timing I've ever seen. Bad plot\\, bad characters\\, bad subplot\\, bad political propaganda\\, just bad. The only good thing about this move was that it ended.","true":true}
