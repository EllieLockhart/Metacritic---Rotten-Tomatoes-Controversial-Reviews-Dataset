Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly the worst movie ive ever seen. On release during the first scene of the movie i had to walk out just because of how utterly ridiculous it is and how they throw away all the previously established physics involved in space travel. On second attempt i had to stop once i saw someone flying in space thanks to the force. Finally years later i forced myself to watch it entirely\\, What a damn mess and waste of time\\, This is garbage. Please actually pay attention to what your making. Worst direction and choreography ive ever seen. Alot of the inner character decision making also makes little sense. This whole trilogy should honestly be redone properly with a set goal in mind other than to include more woman. As it stands\\, this should be lost in history and forgotten.","true":true}
