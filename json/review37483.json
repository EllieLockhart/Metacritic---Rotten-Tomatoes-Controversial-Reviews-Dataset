{"101487":178255,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-05-23","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are some entertaining moments in the film but the majority of the film was infuriatingly bad. This is a spoiler warning for the rest of my review\\, consider yourself warned. There are so many plotholes or just stupid character decisions that are unrealistic and become plotholes. Purple haired admiral not telling people the plan leads to insurrection\\, as a military leader that would never happen because she'd communicate\\, it just feels like a forced plot point that doesn't make sense. They drop bombs in space... Dropping stuff...in space... Finns story arc goes nowhere. At one point finn and rebels are flying towards first order ships in a kamikaze style assault\\, all other rebel ships including rose peel off and finn steams ahead at full speed\\, rose then appears from nowhere and saves him\\, but if he was going full speed and she'd already peeled off theres no way she could have caught up to him. Phasma dies before developing her character. Luke tries to murder kylo ren because he sees a glint of bad in him\\, when he'd done everything to turn vader (the 2nd most evil man in the galaxy) because he saw a tiny bit of good in him\\, lukes character has completely changed. Yodas a dick. 1000s of years of jedi and there are only like 8 books to read. Akbar is killed off and nobody cares. Leia and her superman moment... Jesus christ. I'm not a big star wars fan\\, i like the originals\\, i like the prequels for what they are\\, but this was trash. I'm not criticising it because I want to hate on it\\, i wanted to like it\\, i liked rogue one! I'm criticising it because its so badly written\\, there's no character development\\, the plotholes are glaringly obvious\\, there are entertaining moments sure\\, but they usually stem from a forced bit of plot to make the scenario happen in the first place or they brush over things to ignore the error. E.g. Kylo ren kills snoke\\, he moves a lightsaber with the force and turns it on right next to him\\, but how did snoke not realise when he's so powerful in the force?! When he's literally strong enough in the force to connect rey and rens minds across space\\, but he can't feel (or even see!) a lightsaber moving next to him?! It's completely unbelievable and rips you out of the film as you qiestion it.The best thing about the film are the visuals which were fantastic\\, so props to whoever worked on those\\, great CGI.","true":true}
