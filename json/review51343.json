Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely the worst Star Wars movie to date. Any interesting characters or plot points from the original movies and The Force Awakens were either killed off or answered unsatisfactorily. The story was convoluted with a  bunch of puzzling decisions\\, not to mention a few downright ridiculous ones. Disney and Rian Johnson squandered one of the greatest opportunities in cinema history by not only ruining The Last Jedi\\, but souring the entire franchise. I can not believe that people approved the script and production of this movie.","true":true}
