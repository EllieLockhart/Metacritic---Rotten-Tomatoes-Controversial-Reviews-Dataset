Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Last Jedi took risks that Force Awakens didn't. The easy choice would've been to have Rey be a Skywalker\\, Kenobi\\, or Solo\\, and to leave Snoke and kill him in episode 9 like Return. Instead Rey is forging her own path\\, and we will see the Darth Vader-esk character take the lead in the finale of the new trilogy. I truly don't understand why this many people are hating on this film.","true":true}
