Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dont believe the critic's reviews\\, this movie isnt the 'best Starwars movie since Empire'. In fact its not even a good Starwars movie. The move has a huge amount of plot holes and the fact it completely disregards and throws away many of the things built up in TFW. Not only this but destroys and misrepresents the characters from the original trilogy. Luke Skywalkers representation in this movie was not only disappointing and out of character but flat out disrespectful to fans of Starwars.","true":true}
