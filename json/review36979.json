Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was quite disappointing. My rating is based upon the following points: (1) the uncomfortable anti-white narrative being central to the movie as exhibited by the harsh treatment of Poe by his female superiors as well as the focus on diversity characters when in fact\\, having the minority characters perform outside of the circle of command just marginalizes them even more (decisions were not being made by them\\, they were essentially support personnel)\\, (2) Luke Skywalker's unrealistic outcome - let's face it\\, this was possible but not probable; they are trying to shift the narrative by killing off all of the old heroes\\, (3) the complete lack of political\\, militaristic\\, and economic realism in the story arc when it comes to the Star Wars galaxy. For example\\, if the core worlds were still at stake\\, the rebel leadership would certainly not be running around the outer rim in a ragtag fleet holing themselves up in old rebellion-era bases waiting for miracles. The resistance would be leading the effort from Coruscant or Corellia\\, or one of the industrial powerhouses in the galaxy. This entire trilogy's story was meant to appeal to the average viewer and not the fan base.","true":true}
