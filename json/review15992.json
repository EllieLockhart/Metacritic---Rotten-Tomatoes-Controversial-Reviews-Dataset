Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a die hard Star Wars fan so it was very hard to give a bad rating. While there were some great moments and good dynamics (kylo and rey)\\, there were huge chunks of the movie that should never have been in the final cut. A lot of it reminded me of the prequels in terms of showing off CGI creatures and scenes just because they could. Rose and DJ added nothing to the plot nor were they either of them like-able. The best cast additions were the fish nuns!","true":true}
