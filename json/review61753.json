Connections and relationships among characters and the \\\"build up\\\" of the plot with them has not been properly executed. Some of the flashbacks and old memories of Ellie has been written really well and they were the best moments of the game and some of the best ever moments written on screen.

However graphics\\, animations and acting are great and some of the best you will ever see for a long time. Ending is an anticlimax and doesn't provide any sort of closure to either of the characters or the player. Overall a good game with brave intentions but fails to land on the moon with the execution and unable to connect the pieces due to lack of attention to detail in the story and character elements.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
