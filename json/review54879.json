Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"it's a pile of SJW Bull w\/ bad acting\\, nonsensical plot lines\\, and absolutely NOTHING added to the series. \\n\\nso you have paid advertisements for PETA\\, these are a PITA\\, i like my meat and i don't care about horse racing. \\n\\nyou have that whole plot line of \\\"if we don't get the tracker down it will be a bad thing\\\" only for that whole plot point to not make any difference and whole hour or so of the movie to be for naught. Not to mention shouldn't the rebellion actually be in control right now? they defeated the empire in episode 6 so... why are they still fighting? no reason? good. i can complain about that too. \\n\\nWait a second the whole plot line about disabling the \\\"tracker\\\" is like subtext for \\\"men are crap and terrible impulsive piles of poop\\\" lovely!!  just lovely\\, we don't need Disney spreading this false narrative.  \\n\\nWhat ever you do DO NOT go see this movie. If it wasn't for the Derogatory SJW narrative\\, then i would just say \\\"it is a bad movie go watch it if you want to\\\"\\, but it is the blatant and Derogatory Narrative that is making me HIGHLY recommend you do no go watch this movie. It is propaganda almost exclusively. Don't watch it. Don't support it\\, in fact go out to the theaters or the Disney parks and protest it. end of story.","true":true}
