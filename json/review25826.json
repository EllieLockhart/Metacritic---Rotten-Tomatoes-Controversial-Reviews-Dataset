Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"not enough words to describe the issues with this film. Lacks originality. I get and respect homages but The Last Jedi is a total rip off of Empire and Return of the Jedi. plot holes are huge and continuity is an issue. Not sure Rian Johnson respects his audience or the lore of Star Wars. However\\, the film is better than Lucas' version of episodes 1-3\\, but not by much. I hope they get it right with episode 9 but my expectations are low","true":true}
