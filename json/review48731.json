Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst movie in the franchise! Disney Star Wars is a horrible franchise. TFA is still the Worst because it's a rip off of A New HOPE\\, but this movie really sucks. Its not a rip off\\, but a remix of already done ideas. Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy\\, along with executive producer JJ Abrams have destroyed the franchise. Critics love it\\, but they also loved other crappy movies\\, so take their word with a grain of salt. I am no longer a Star Wars fan. Thanks Disney\\, you're truly the world's evil empire.","true":true}
