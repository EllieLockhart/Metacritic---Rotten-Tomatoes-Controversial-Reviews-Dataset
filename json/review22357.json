Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Laughable plot holes\\, underdeveloped characters and laughable(not funny) dialect are the first three reasons that come to mind as I give this franchise killer a half star.  This series started as a tale of good vs evil\\,  it's become a political platform.  Disney won't be seeing any more of my money.","true":true}
