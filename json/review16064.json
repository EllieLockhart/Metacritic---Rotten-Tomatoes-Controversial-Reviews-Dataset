Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a long-time Star Wars fan\\, my sister is not. We both saw the film and agreed there were a couple of things to like about it. The cast is great\\, the music is great\\, and the sets\/costumes are great. However...the story and dialog\\, along with certain cinematography choices really hurt this film. What was the point of the casino parts? Or the forced romances? Also the handling of the character stories for Leia and Luke were insulting. Anyways\\, I would say stream this film or purchase it discounted on blue-ray at a later date. Spending money in the theater for this Star Wars will only remind long time Star Wars fans of the disappointment they felt while watching Episode II for the first time.","true":true}
