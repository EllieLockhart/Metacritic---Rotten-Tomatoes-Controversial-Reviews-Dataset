Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Totally inept and incompetent film-making. How such a ridiculous and nonsensical script ever got the green light is beyond me. As a movie\\, it's utter garbage; as a STAR WARS movie\\, it's an abomination. Do yourself a favor and avoid this tripe. In fact\\, you would be doing yourself a huge favor by avoiding everything produced by Hollywood\\, turning off the TV\\, and reading books instead.","true":true}
