Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was very disappointed from the beginning because it felt rush (yet managed to push over 2 hrs). The franchise is not following through with previous sub plots or the newly added political agenda scenes (which was just filler).It felt very rushed in terms of the story flow. Lots of subplots set up in The Force Awakens got dropped. Apparently every high ranking imperial can be beaten by a Jedi rookie and a ex-Stormtrooper. Lia's scene was hilarious instead of serious (reminds me\\, and others\\, of Mary Poppins). Snoke was intriguing until they made a useless amateur out of him. Rey and Kylo Ren are both becoming  extremely boring fast! I did not care for all the new characters added for this one and their unnecessary sacrifices (the last one was especially ridiculous and pointless\\, f'n Rose!). Seemingly important characters get scrapped quickly. There really was no consequence for bad decisions since everyone was established as being virtuous (instead of logical). This film is just another victim of poor writing. I hesitated to see this\\, and now I am not interested in seeing the next one this storyline anymore.","true":true}
