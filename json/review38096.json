Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The story move up from what we know about Star Wars\\, in a great way. -It's a new beginning\\, and a start for further developments. \\nI only hope Jar Jar Abrams will not ruin everything in the next one! We don't need further reminds of what happened 30+ years ago: this is a new (and great) era.","true":true}
