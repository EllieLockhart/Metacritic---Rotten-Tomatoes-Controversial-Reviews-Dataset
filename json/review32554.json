Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\\" gets 4 out of 5 stars! This movie wasn't perfect\\, but it was really good! The first 10 or so minutes was a little too goofy\\, but luckily it mostly pivoted away from that quickly. There was also a segment in it that should have been cut\\, as it served no purpose to the story. There are a couple other minor things I would have changed\\, but the over-arching story is original and creative and didn't borrow from old movies in the franchise\\, which was a good thing. I understand a bit of the criticism\\, but the overarching story is very original and cool and other than a few things I thought it was very good. It could have been slightly better executed\\, but overall the story was what made it so good. Despite The Force Awakens lack of originality\\, it was better executed than this\\, although that's not to say this was poorly executed\\, just not as well as Force Awakens. The story itself was very compelling though and was fresh and exciting and that still propels this to my #3 favorite Star Wars behind Empire Strikes Back and RETURN of the Jedi.","true":true}
