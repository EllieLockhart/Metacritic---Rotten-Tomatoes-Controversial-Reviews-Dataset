Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars Episode 8 quick review:\\nIt was a great showing of the over-engineered-for-first-theater-viewing mechanics developed and implemented by Disney. Focus groups\\, sample audiences and test-showings be damned; There was a lot wrong with it after a second viewing and deeper scrutiny. Casual viewers go see it at least once. It's great for that. Star Wars fans... don't see it twice. It won't stand the test of time as Episodes 3-7 (and Rogue One) have\/will.","true":true}
