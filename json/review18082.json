Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thoroughly enjoyed The Last Jedi. It was not what I wanted going in\\, but I loved what they did with the characters and story. The Force is not a function of only one family. Luke was damaged and broken\\, yet redeemed himself\\, as is fitting for this universe. Rey and Ren are two kids playing with powers they do not understand or know how to control. This movie sets up a great option for Episode IX\\, with the Resistance on the verge of collapse\\, but plenty of Force sensitives waiting in the wings. I'm curious and excited to see what Episode IX brings.","true":true}
