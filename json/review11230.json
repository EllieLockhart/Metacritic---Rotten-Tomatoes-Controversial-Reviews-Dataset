Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly I was pretty dissatisfied with this movie\\, it promised so much but delivered so little. The writing was just awful\\, so much crappy forced humor. Don't get me started on the bird things they threw in so they could make plusgies. This film really felt like it had no substance\\, you couldn't feel the stakes. The short timeframe of the movie couldve been written well I suppose but it's just not. There are some seriously impressive scenes in the movie\\, but when you are just looking for scenes to justify seeing a movie\\, something's wrong. The side plot was uninteresting and they somehow made characters that are hard to feel for. I didn't care about the majority of what was happening on screen even though I was trying to. It felt like a crappy avengers movie in the way it was written and jeez even those movies can make you feel for the characters. My recommendation is to see it and form your own opinion but I don't think you're gonna want to see it twice.","true":true}
