Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie franchise has spanned my entire 41 year life\\, and this movie signifies the death of this franchise to me.  I understand the story changes\\, characters die\\, and the story continues.  I was actually looking forward to that.  The way the legendary characters were handled was an absolute embarrassment.  Luke Skywalker\\, the greatest hero of all time\\, had a curtain call that was downright disrespectful.  This director\\, I believe\\, was working completely as a \\\"Yes man\\,\\\" for Disney.  I will not watch anything else he does moving forward.  There was no resolution in this movie\\, no development of character arch\\, story lines that didn't need to be in there.  You could have given Leia a glorious exit\\, and even botched that up.  Laura Dern?  Benicio Del Toro?  Great actors\\, but their characters did not need to exist.  Disney killed off the old characters in an attempt for a money grab on the youth moving forward.  Disney is not making these movies for the people that have made the franchise worth 4 billion.  Maybe Disney doesn't need my money\\, and that is a good thing\\, because they won't get it on any Star Wars movie moving forward.  I take this personally.","true":true}
