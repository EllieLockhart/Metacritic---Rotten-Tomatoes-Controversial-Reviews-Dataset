Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson did the Star Wars community a disservice with this movie. Unlike the force awakens\\, this movie did damage to the saga. The critics are on crack. This movie had some good moments which were vastly overshadowed with the godawful moments that just ruined the film. It a must see for Star Wars fans only so you can witness the work of someone who unintentionally delivered a critical blow to the saga we all love.","true":true}
