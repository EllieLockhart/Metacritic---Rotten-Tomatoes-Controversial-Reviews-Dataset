Out of respect for the craft I give it a 6\\, but this game is more a movie than a game and not in a good way.\rThey forget that as a player at the wheel you should steer. Instead the story must go where it must go according to the directors and writers. This is a huge problem when your underlying message is violence begets more violence. You cannot condemn violence and talk about how bad it is while taking away player choice. As a result many of the plot points and climaxes fall flat on its ass.\r\rThe game's biggest gimmick is how perspective changes your point of view. So if this fails to impress you\\, the game does very little except that. The impact is a literal \\\"all your eggs in one basket\\\".\rSpeaking of climaxes\\, it's certainly a problem if you don't care for any of the characters. This point being subjective. Some will but I didn't. As a result I rather enjoyed playing as the infamous new character the game introduces.\r\rThroughout we don't get a say in what characters do. No option to kill A or spare B. Things just runs on rails. I thought I was clever in thinking that I would spare as many humans as I could via stealth\\, only to learn that certain doors won't unlock until hostiles are cleared. Literally forcing me to commit murder even though I got past all the threats non lethal.\r\rIt's a stealth game. I dig it. I can appreciate that\\, but then you get RE:4 cabin sequences and it really doesn't make sense the rest of the game design considered. It's just frustrating and tedious. If you start a gunfight via poor judgment - then fair enough\\, but forced sequences don't work for this title.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
