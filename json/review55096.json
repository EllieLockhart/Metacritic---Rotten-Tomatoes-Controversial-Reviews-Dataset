Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I want to answer the question: \\\"Why are people still bashing this movie after weeks?\\\"\\nThe answer is that if you let enough people say this movie is good (actually\\, 91% critics score means it is a masterpiece\\, which it is definitely NOT)\\, then it will remembered as a good movie which has not been understood by the audience.\\nUnfortunately\\, nothing could be further from the truth. \\nThis is a mediocre movie by itself. Don't trust the professional critics. They are all too afraid to tell the Mighty Mouse that this movie sucks.\\nIf you add to it that it completely lacks all requirements for being part of a well established saga with a well defined universe and lore\\, it becomes an awfully mediocre movie.\\nDisney made a terrible mistake to let an amateur director write and direct a trilogy movie. I don't know how such a mistake could even happen to a company with literally billions of dollars to spend. Did anyone read the script after Johnson said he had finished it?\\nIt is obviously half baked. How can a 200 million production be given to a single person for writing and directing?\\nNo one  noticed that Johnson needed a writing tutor?\\nIt is so mind-bogging that I started to believe it has been done on purpose.\\nAnd this purpose was that of slapping in the face the Star Wars fans\\, identified by Kennedy as mid-aged\\, white\\, male\\, wealthy\\, meat-eaters\\, conservatives. \\nThe plan was that of luring them into the theaters by letting them believe (through clearly misleading trailers) that they would be watching a real Star Wars movie\\, with all of their childhood heroes honored and cherished\\, and giving them instead forced politically correctness\\, forced female supremacy (with female leaders miserably failing to show even a single bit of competence)\\, forced diversity (with colored characters reduced to comic relief or absurdly empty and shallow characters)\\, forced animal rights advocacy (with our \\\"heroes\\\" saving the animals only and completely ignoring the enslaved children)\\, forced slapstick humor (which completely ruined every single epic moment of the movie).\\nA DISASTER.\\nI don't know what will happen to Johnson and Kennedy\\, but if I was the Disney CEO\\, I would fire them.\\nTheir behavior will cause serious damage to Disney\\, and I think they don't like to lose money.\\nIf you liked the Star Wars universe\\, lore and characters\\, PLEASE don't watch this \\\"movie\\\". Don't do that to yourself. You would regret it.","true":true}
