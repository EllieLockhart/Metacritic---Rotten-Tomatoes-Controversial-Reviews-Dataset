Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Depressing and sad. How seemingly intelligent people can produce this rubbish is beyond me. Absolutely no point in putting the title Star Wars in this. \\n\\nThe Force Awakens was bad\\, this was just horrible.","true":true}
