Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Though the cinematography was wonderful the only thing I enjoyed about the story was the chemistry between Kylo Ren and Rey. Everything else seemed forced\\, rushed\\,out of place and didn't match with the previous movies set up. Doesn't leave me anxious to see the finale at all.","true":true}
