Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I did not like this film. Luke's character was someone altogether different from the Luke we knew in the previous episodes. It would have been better if they used a different actor\\, not because of the acting\\, Mark was great\\, but because the characterization was so wrong\\, it wasn't Luke at all. \\n\\nI felt like this film just didn't have heart. When Luke died there was no emotional impact\\, I think partly because how he was portrayed\\, and partly because the story sucked. Snoke is some powerful master\\, yet you know NOTHING about him and he lasted 5 minutes. \\n\\nThis was the Star Wars version of a Michael Bay film\\, lot's of shiny explosive things\\, and little plot or character development. I looked at my watch several times wondering how much longer it was going to be. How did Rian Johnson get an entire trilogy based on this movie?? What a waste of this franchise and the actors.\\n\\nI was so looking forward to this after seeing Rogue One\\, which was fantastic\\, but now I'm not looking forward to the next installments. I actually bought Moviepass to see this multiple times in theaters\\, well once was one too many. I will not give Disney any more money for this.","true":true}
