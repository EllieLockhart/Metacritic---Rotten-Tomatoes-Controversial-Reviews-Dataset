Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What's more infuriating about this movie is that it had the potential of being great with some changes. To name one\\, have Luke teach Rey\\, and Snoke do the same with Kylo and you could at least have a flawed sith fight a soon-to-be-capable jedi. I mean you could argue that after Rogue One's final awesome scene these people would figure what the audience wants. But hey\\, you can always have Luke milking an alien for blue colored milk.","true":true}
