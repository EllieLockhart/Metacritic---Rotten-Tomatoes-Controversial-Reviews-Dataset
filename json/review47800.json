{"101487":196258,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where do I start ...\\n\\nI'm just a dude\\, a guy who grew up with Star Wars\\, I have young kids now that I introduced to SW and they're down.  They wear SW shirts and backpacks to school.  Like Rey\\, I'm a nobody\\, and my parent's are nobodies.\\n\\nI'm tempted to qualify my review by explaining my full relationship with Star Wars\\, the status of my nostalgia\\, age\\, sex\\, political persuasion\\, etc. -  because I think these things matter in how you consume and digest this episode.  Ultimately\\, though\\, Star Wars is something that has thus far transcended these differences ... right?\\n\\nI have friends and family who will watch anything.  They will launch Netflix\\, put on pretty much anything and they'll be entertained - so this film is for them\\, they'll love this.\\n\\nIn no way will this be a complete review\\, because honestly\\, I don't even know what it was that I saw last night and at this point I can't remember all the points in the film that had me thinking ... WTF is going on and how did this happen?\\n\\nHere's my inarticulate take\\, but from the heart ...\\n\\n1)  Shitty humor ... within the first minutes of the film ... Poe's\\, \\\"Okay\\, I'll hold\\\" dialogue completely took me out of the Star Wars universe by using modern day\\, our modern day universe\\, colloquial type humor.  And\\, it went on too long.  The first line\\, I was like\\, okay\\, chuckle\\, but as it went on.  Yoda's\\, \\\"Not exactly a page turner\\\" referring to the Jedi literature\\, I began to realize ... oh sh!t\\, this film is not taking itself seriously ... am I watching Space Balls right now???\\n\\n2)  More shitty humor ... there was so much shoehorning of out of character \/ universe \\\"humor\\\" that it drew you out of the film and universe.  This did not feel like a Star Wars film.  Kasdan does this well\\, Rian absolutely did not.\\n\\n2)  Meandering plot ... The film just meanders on and on\\, with no focus or sense of where are we going.  Lots of disjointed scenes that didn't seem to be cohesive.  Sub plots that you don't care about and are disconnected to the main story ... whatever that was\\, seriously.\\n\\n3)  Hamill not into it ... I could sense that Mark Hamill was just not into it\\, his acting.  Luke and the dialogue was just so all out of character\\, and not in an interesting way.  I read that he fundamentally disagreed with what Rian was doing with Luke\\, and it shows.\\n\\n4)  Leia\\, Mary Poppins space float ... floating back to the ship after being frozen in the vacuum of space .. WTF?  What was the purpose of this?  To trick to audience to think she had died\\, but then she didn't?  Or to show that she is strong in the force?  Either one\\, what a total bullsh!t way to convey these ideas ... dumb.  Could have been so many different\\, non cheesy ways to convey these ideas.\\n\\n5)  Ben and Rey FaceTime chats ... what's up with these FaceTime sessions?  Just very random and weird\\, hard to buy into the idea that Rey sees good in him\\, etc\\, etc.\\n\\n6)  Snokes death ... After watching the last film\\, what were we all talking about?  Who is Snoke?  Where is Snoke?  What is he\\, etc?  It was a great\\, intriguing mystery that had us all talking\\, everyone with their own theory.  Only\\, to be completely let down in this film with absolutely nothing more on this character.  And then\\, a totally weak death scene\\, void of any depth.\\n\\n7)  Rey in the cave ... So Rey explores the dark side\\, I guess (at this point I felt like maybe I was watching a Harry Potter movie)\\, and is looking into one of those infinity mirrors.  This was kinda cool because it reminded me of those times that I would look into the medicine cabinet and see infinite me's bouncing off the other medicine cabinet mirror on the other side.  Anyway\\, she somehow make her way to the front of the line and ... wait for it ... sees herself.\\n\\n8)  Whoa ... mind blown.  A whole scene where you thought something interesting was going to happen\\, and actually nothing happened at all.  No payoff\\, nothing.  I was sort of rooting for a similar thing like when Luke visioned Vader\\, cut his head off\\, then the mask exploded and he saw himself in it ... perhaps this is what Rian was trying to convey ... but if so\\, my 12 year old daughter has some more effective script ideas.\\n\\n9)  Rey's parents ... Here's another big thing that we all came out of the last movie wondering\\, pondering\\, dreaming of.  Who are Rey's parent's?  Is she a Skywalker?  This hole plot point was also just thrown away.  Now\\, this is one that could be redeemed in the next film\\, but seriously\\, if you're going to go there in this film\\, give the audience some payoff.\\n\\n10)  Political themes\\, social justice themes ... You know\\, let's just leave it at that.  You either see it or you don't\\, you then either with it agree or you don't. \\n\\n11)  Did Luke really even train Rey ... maybe I nodded off during the film\\, but other than \\\"one session in the morning\\\"\\, did Luke really train Rey?  Did I miss something that is the crux of the film\\, that the Jedi is not dead and will continue via Rey???\\n\\n12)  Luke death ... WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  A great\\, mythical character goes like that?  No fight?  Gone after a FaceTime session with Kylo???  Really weak too ... What's the explanation\\, he was drained of force power so he died?  Just didn't buy it\\, din't evoke any feelings\\, even though they tried with the whole binary suns shot and the JW music ... all style and no substance.\\n\\n13)  OGs gone forever ... Took me several hours after watching the film to realize that our OGs are all gone.  Luke\\, Leia\\, Han.  They will not be in the next film.  Yeah\\, maybe Luke as a force ghost\\, but wow\\, what a let down.\\n\\n14)  What are we talking about after seeing this film ... ABOUT WHAT A LET DOWN THIS MOVIE WAS!!!  We're not pondering why Vader was Luke's father or how is Leia\\, Luke's sister\\, or who is Rey's parents\\, or what the hell is Snoke.\\n\\n15)  Kids aren't even that impressed ... So I was a kid who experienced the original films when they came out.  Therefore I was an adult obviously for the subsequent films\\, and now I have my own young Padawan offspring viewers.  Each film gave us something to really ponder and talk about.  This one leaves us little to dream about\\, with both adult and child audiences.  The kids liked it\\, but had nothing really to say or talk about other than the Porgs.  You know\\, the visual candy was enough for them.\\n\\n16)  Audience unintended reactions ... The audience I saw the film with was enthusiastic as we all were at the start.  Some chuckles at the shoehorned humor\\, but not a lot\\, and increasingly less so as the film went on.  Then\\, they started laughing at serous moments\\, like the Leigh space floating scene ... they as I\\, found it ridiculous.\\n\\nSome other observations:\\n\\n-  After the opening crawl\\, during the pan down\\, the flute line\\, it was identical to A New Hope.  Not saying this a negative thing\\, but just thought it interesting.  Every film thus far has done something unique there.  I was thinking\\, was there a reason for this\\, or did Rian specifically request the original line because it held some nostalgic value to him?  For me\\, this was the very first thing that took me out of this unique Star Wars episode.\\n\\n-  Did anyone say\\, \\\"I have a bad feeling about this\\\"?\\n\\nNever thought I'd be hating on a Star Wars film like this.  Just super disappointed.  Rian was the wrong choice for a Star Wars film.  He's great\\, love his own films\\, his style\\, etc.  But it's just not right for this.  I am floored that the rest of Disney went along with this\\, that this is the film that got released.  And to think that he's in charge of another trilogy ...","true":true}
