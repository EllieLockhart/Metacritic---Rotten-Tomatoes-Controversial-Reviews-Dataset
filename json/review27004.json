Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best Star Wars movies in my opinion. The characters are complex and it shows great character development throughout the entire film. Everyone that\u2019s bashing on it really didn\u2019t see the beauty of the message that the Last Jedi brings. Adam Driver\\, Daisy Ridley\\, and Mark Hamill are absolutely amazing representing their characters. This takes Star Wars into a new direction\\, and I think it\u2019s a direction fans should get behind. If you\u2019re worried about watching because of these ratings\\, don\u2019t. Watch the movie because it\u2019s moving in all the ways that Star Wars can be. ","true":true}
