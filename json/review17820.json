Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It gets half a star for being original and another half for a few good parts\/charactors.  Overall it was a huge dissapointment with filler plot lines\\, uninteresting characters\\, and the wrong kind of humor. The humor in previous star wars movies fit in the story while this humor felt more aimed at the audience. Laura Dern's charactor was the most anoying charactor I've come across in Star Wars\\, yes worse than Jar Jar. Luke charactor was squandered\\, I understand it's not his adventure but he deserved better. Worst Star Wars movie imo\\, which is saying something. I've never been less excited to see a Star Wars movie than Episode IX.","true":true}
