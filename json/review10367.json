Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great movie that takes all these fanboy theories and flips them on their heads with unpredictable and fresh takes on a new Star Wars story. I love how the Jedi orders hubris is finally addressed and it's burned to the ground. Of course Luke would ultimately learn the lesson that the force is bigger than the Jedis. The characters are developed and tragically complex rather than two dimensional heros.","true":true}
