Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Harrison Ford 's sendoff in The force awakens was at least respectful. Mark Hamill's treatment was ridiculous and pointless. Pointless pretty much sums up the entire movie. What got accomplished? Just a painfuly drawn out chase scene\\, a pile of unnecessary CGI\\, and my favorite childhood hero getting kicked to the curb like literally a fart in the wind.","true":true}
