Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I preface this by saying go into the game with an open mind.

The story is amazing and very powerful\\, it truly makes you reflect on the characters choices. Naughty dog absolutely delivers with this game even if I still wish things had been different. I have never played through a series that was so emotionally gripping.  Naughty dog truly created a world that pulls you in and keeps you drawn for the vast majority. That being said there are some points where you feel tedious gameplaywise. The story truly has you engaged at all time. I highly recommend you play this game. Also for all of those who worry about things like this. Naughty dog did a great job at keeping strong female character's\\, including a racially diverse group\\, and adding LGBTQ themes all without it feeling shoved down your throat and making the male characters look weak. This game is a perfect example of how to spread social awareness without having to make one party look inferior. I really hope they make this a trilogy\\, and so long as they nail the cast\\, I will be very much looking forward to the hbo series.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
