Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In one movie Rian Johnson is perfectly able to encapture the dichotomy of Star Wars\\, at least from the point of the viewer. When this movie is good\\, it's remarkable. Chills down your spine\\, \\\"this is why movies are great\\\" good. But when it's bad\\, it makes you shake your head and wonder what went on in the writing room. This is the exact duality that the series has always had. The good is among the best\\, but the bad is unforgettable. The Last Jedi's biggest crime is falling victim to its own spectacle. The movie masterfully sets up so many moments for critique\\, dialogue\\, and insight that you can't help but sit in your seat and start to think deeply and become engaged by the movie's characters and their arcs. However\\, it remains shallow\\, instead of delivering on much of it's messaging\\, it hopes you become distracted by witty jokes and bombastic action sequences. While the action is marvelous\\, and the jokes get a chuckle\\, the end result is something that feels...unbalanced\\, to use the film's own motifs against it. As a Star Wars fan\\, and a fan of movies in general\\, it get's the job done. The characters and their relationships are engaging and push the plot forward and keep me invested in the series (the relationship between Kylo Ren and Rey is absoltuely entralling). But if you go for something deeper\\, it's just not there in the capacity that it could've\\, or arguably should've\\, been.","true":true}
