Gameplay wise\\, the mechanics are quite similar to it's predecessing game and offers an improved aspect to it's game quality\\, providing an initial similarity to how the game mechanics work. I'm my opinion this was an adequate measure to make it a more gamer friendly system. In terms of the story\\, this review would have gotten a 10\/10 if some elements of the story weren't so choppy\\, messy or rushed. In the first half of the game\\, I found it to be quite good honestly apart from earlier events that shaped the basis of this 'John wick' story concept of getting revenge and personally\\, I quite enjoyed this. It was still ok during the second half to me although it caused a somewhat controversial perspective to the game but it was only during the end of the game that I thought the game was becoming a bit too choppy and rushed. Other then this mishap\\, I personally found the game to be quite good!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
