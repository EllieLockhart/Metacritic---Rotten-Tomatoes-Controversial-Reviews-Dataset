Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the prequels were better that this fluff piece bulls@%t..   star wars\\, star trek... why are all these supposed franchise continuations ignoring so much of the source material\\, and ignoring the actual fans.\\n\\nalso its boring","true":true}
