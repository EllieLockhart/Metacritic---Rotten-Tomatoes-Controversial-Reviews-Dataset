Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love Star Wars and had high hopes for this movie but left the theatre so frustrated. The movie gets two stars because it's beautifully shot. But the amount of plot holes\\, forced humour\\, and storylines from Force Awakens that have been thrown away made this movie almost unwatchable. Ryan Johnson has taken The Force Awakens and dumped every set up and storyline that JJ Abrams created\\, and on his own agenda\\, has created a Star Wars movie that craps on every fan theory and appreciation from episode 7. It's not all bad.... but there isn't much set up for another episode here. As a stand alone star wars movie it's fine. But this was meant to be a continuation of a story\\, the integral part of a trilogy. Instead all we are left with is hope that the storyline can be salvaged in the concluding episode.","true":true}
