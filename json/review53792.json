Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great visuals and nothing more.  Humor falls flat and adds no value.  Harrison Ford is lucky Solo he was killed off in 7.  The heroes run around to try and save the Resistance but they don't accomplish anything.  The heroes should actually save the day in a Star Wars movie.  The all powerful Snoke was a wimp and gets killed by a whiny brat (Kylo Ren).  Leia is now Superman and can live in space without a space suit and fly around in space.  Even in the prequels the Jedi had to use a breathing device to to go underwater.  At least Finn could have had his Randy Quaid moment (Independence Day) and save the day but no.  You have Luke project himself across the universe to stall while the last remaining good guys escape.  Captain Plasma is still a wimp.  Everyone is waiting to find out who Rey's parents are and then it is a big nothing.  Rey knows how to use the force with little or no training.  Even Anakin had to be trained.  It's like Rian Johnson has never seen a Star Wars film before.  Disney needs to come up with a plan and map things out rather than just have random directors do random things with this franchise.  It is almost like this was a standalone movie that does not resemble a Star Wars movie other than special effects and costumes.  Close to being just as bad as episode I.","true":true}
