Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a massive fan of Star Wars. Met Mark Hamill\\, have a picture of Vader signed by Dave Prowse and James E Jones\\, have read many books and played almost all the video games. This was a deeply thought provoking film that changed Star Wars as we know it. People don\u2019t like change. Change is inevitable. This story will stand the test of time and is hugely entertaining. I was shocked\\, laughed\\, felt uncomfortable at times\\, pondered over it\\, and will see it many times before the ideas and direction will sink in. This movie will lead to a successful generation of films and expansion of Star Wars. It already is hugely controversial. It\u2019s an important and meaningful human experience and at the same time has a light air about it. Enjoy the adventure and consider the possibility that average nobodies can be heroes too. Villains can be overcome by using strategy\\, not always glory. Even through failure\\, you can teach others to succeed. Noble ideas and I am proud of this film.","true":true}
