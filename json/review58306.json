Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute nonsense storywise and extremely racist. The two leads of color are turned from brave\\, kind\\, competent men to useless coward and hotheaded\\, reckless idiots. The first female star wars lead is completely robbed of her agency through the whole movie and upstaged by Literal Fascist Warlord Kylo Ren. Luke Skywalker's character was completely trashed. None of the decisions the characters make throughout the story are congruent with their characters or the SW universe lore. Would have preferred 2 and a half hours of Jar Jar Binks adventuring through space to be quite honest.","true":true}
