Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really fun movie. Nice blend of new and old characters. Doesn't take itself too seriously and is all the better for it. Looks fantastic\\, great music and some great set pieces.\\n\\nAll the boys complaining about how the movie is promoting \\\"feminazi\\\"\\, \\\"leftist\\\" \\\"liberal\\\" etc are a joke. Somehow it is ok to beloved that the\\\"force\\\" is real but are unable to believe that women may be leaders in a rebellion lol. I am a life long fan\/nerd but it is just a movie.","true":true}
