Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film kills the last of the interesting characters in the series and all that is left are young characters that are not interesting whatsoever. This film contributes nothing to the series and Adam driver as the sole bad guy is so not interesting since he plays basically a teenager that is angry for no reason. The mystery is gone. The interesting heroes are gone. Only Disney characters remain.","true":true}
