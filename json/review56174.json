Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best Star Wars movie since empire strikes back. What a way to bring in ELEMENTS of its predecessors while still introducing fresh new concepts. This is the Star Wars movie that we always wanted. It gives those same feelings of intrigue \\, anticipation\\, and conflict of morality as the empire strikes back. All while being it's own movie completely. While force awakens was an enjoyable reboot\\, it is obvious that they played it safe. THIS is not the same formulaic  movie as that one. Separate and great in its own way. There are flaws as is the case in many films\\, but overall you have to be looking hard for them to not enjoy the movie. At some moments I felt as if the movie might have peaked too soon but I was rewarded by the time the movie ended. Really don't see how they can top this one","true":true}
