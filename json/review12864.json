{"101487":130558,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-22","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't like \\\"Episode VII\\\" but I had to think about it realise it. When I exited the movie theatre I wasn't sure what to think. I quite enjoyed the experience but something felt wrong. It was like buying the new album of one of your favourite bands\\, going thorugh it from first track to last only to realise 10 out of 13 tracks were just a rearrangement of old greatest hits (and the other 3 were nothing special really). So nice experience for a fan\\, but nothing memorable as an original work.\\nThis time was different\\, \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" felt simply lika bad movie. Maybe an average one in general\\, but terrible as a part of te Star Wars saga. So terrible in fact that I just signed up here for the sole purpose of giving him a 1 star review in a foreign language (I am Italian\\, so forgive my mistakes). \\nI won't even talk about how Luke seemed a completely new character rathen than an evolution than decades before discovered the way of the Force\\, because I don't want to give the impression that this a nostalgia driven review.\\nThe story seems to zig-zag in multiple directions only in order to keep you in the room for longer than necessary\\, some storylines simply feels like long trips to nowhere.\\nThere are no iconic characters whatsoever. Two movies into the trilogy and we still don't have a serious villain. We don't know where the First Order comes from or what it really is\\, it appears to be a carbon copy of the Empire in almost every possible form which happens to have a different name\\, possibly for tax reason. Who is Snoke? Where does he come from? he looks like a millenary creature with close to unlimited powers but for some reason no one heard of him back in the Empire years just a few decades before. Doesn't it need an expalantion of some sort? No\\, the writer just decided to kill him in the stupidest possible way leaving us with a villain-in-chief who is as believable in this role as Chris Griffin would be. The Force is strong with him\\, as they say\\, but he's constantly on the verge of an emotional breakdown. If a villain is making his job right whenever he's in action you should be worried for the good guys rather than being afraid someone could kick his ass and make him cry by saying something rude.\\nIf there are memorable scenes at all I just can't remember any of them (which probably prove there are not) but certainly there are a few scene I'd like to forget. Leia turning into a flying Superman was just ludicrous \\, and how about Rey force-texting with Kylo Ren straight out of the shower? And this time\\, instead of just remaking old Star Wars scene they also took a few from Matrix\\, Shrek and possibly When Harry met Sally. I am just thankful the writer hasn't been watching Titanic lately.\\nThe Jedi way is nowhere to be seen throughout the movie. It is said during the film that the Force is not just \\\"flying stuff\\\" but it doesn't look like the last Jedi standing (Rey) can do much more than that and having fun with the lightsaber.\\nTwo thirds into it I don't think this trilogy can be saved and the thought that there's probably another one coming after it should really worry any Star Wars fan\\, it certainly worries me.","true":true}
