Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was probably the most disappointing Star Wars I have ever seen\\, including episodes 1-3. It did not feel congruent with the Star Wars universe at all. The story was disjointed and circular and did not feel as though it progressed its characters. They terribly disrespected Luke's character from beginning to end. The humor was off color for a Star Wars film to the point I felt like I was watching an SNL skit. They put too much time into flashy side plots without investing in the characters themselves so none of the sideplots grabbed my attention or even felt necessary. It all felt like a paper facade with no real substance. I went into the movie so excited but was anxious for it to be over about an hour and a half in. They also played it incredibly fast and loose with the Force. If you are going to make a movie in a world that is that well loved\\, well known and well developed\\, you have to do better with respecting its origins\\, rules and roots. This film did not; It was bitterly disappointing. I did not get emotional\\, I did not get goosebumps-I got restless and increasingly disheartened. Don't get me wrong-it was a pretty movie. But it was also empty.","true":true}
