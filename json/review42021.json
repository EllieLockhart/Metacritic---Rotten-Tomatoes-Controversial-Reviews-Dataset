Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie made me see sad to watch\\, it's likely this is the end of good star wars movie unless Kathleen Kennedy is replaced. I'm not going to watch more of these bad Star wars movies As long as Kathleen Kennedy is in control of them while firing directors left and right\\, Thanks Kathleen Kennedy for making one of my childhood movies a joke!","true":true}
