Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"The Last Jedi\\\" Is a really fun time. It goes against the grain of normal star wars movies but it still has the original star wars feel to it. I could go without the casino planet but everything else was well made and well thought out.","true":true}
