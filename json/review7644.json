Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everything that was setup in The Force Awakens was tossed to the side like yesterday's trash. I went in expecting to see a Star Wars movie. This was not that. Star Wars is a family space opera. I hope Disney reconsiders giving Rian Johnson a trilogy. This was horribly timed and quite boring at times.","true":true}
