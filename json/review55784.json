Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Perhaps the greatest worst Star Wars film since Phantom Menace. Once the honeymoon period wears off people are going to admit that this film was written so terrible that not only does it contradict what the Force Awakens set up\\, but also forgets elements of the plot. It's a shame that I have to give a negative review especially a Star Wars film. But I promise that my review is not based on the \\\"direction\\\" the film went but by how sloppy and pretentious the 2-3rd act was about not just the secondary characters but also the newcommers who I hate to say served no purpose other than to set up the next trilogy. I have no interest in ep IX and I'm deeply sorry for JJ Abrams. Who has to clean up shop after opening up the place. Never let Rian Johnson direct and write another Star Wars film Disney.","true":true}
