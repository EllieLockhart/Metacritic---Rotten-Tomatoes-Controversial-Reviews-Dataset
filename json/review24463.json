Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"More than I could have hoped for in a Star Wars flick. It was packed full of character arcs for everyone\\, all about the theme of failure and what to do with the past. Lots of subverting expectations and delivering genuinely surprising moments. Refreshing\\, humorous\\, but still emotional - I loved it.","true":true}
