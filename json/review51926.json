Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A film with many funny moments and many jokes. Unfortunately\\, the two never coincided\\, as the jokes were forced\\, and the script laughable. The storyboard looks to have been put together by a child making a collage of scenes from the original six films\\, and\\, with the exception of Finn and Kylo Ren\\, whose characters were painfully underdeveloped in The Force Awakens\\, no characters were given any positive development. With scenes as laughable as Leia turning into Super-Man\\, this entry to the franchise would be better off placed alongside Spaceballs on your shelf\\, because if you go in expecting anything but a poorly made spoof\\, you're going to be disappointed.","true":true}
