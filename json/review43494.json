Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was bad\\, I saw it in the theaters and have decided I will never see another Star Wars movie until the franchise is bought by someone new. I'm sad I'm late for a timely review to be perfectly honest. Maybe\\, just maybe I could've saved someone from viewing this terrible movie.\\n\\nFirstly Rey is a Mary Sue\\, insanely overpowered. Secondly Holdo makes her plan not apparent and causes a mutiny. Thirdly I simply hate how the whole destiny thing got torn apart and Luke was made into a sad\\, sorry character. \\n\\nI would go into more detail\\, but I'd rather not dig into this toxic sludge anymore.","true":true}
