Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst movie I've ever seen. Completely ruined the Star Wars saga for me. Yes it was that bad\\, and no I am not a Russian bot. I am a life long Star Wars fan and I love the fantasy genre. Nothing about this movie was good. From the first scene to the poorly performed and written final scenes this movie was nothing but suffering. It is destined to be the next Rocky Horror Picture Show where true fans go as a goof. The only time this movie brings me any joy is when I make fun of it\\, watch videos of people making fun of it\\, watching videos of people explaining how bad it was\\, or not watching it at all.
