Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A lot of people are saying that tropls are bringing down the rating on purpose\\, but seriously the f*** ups in the movie are way to many to ignore\\, gravity in space\\, breathing in space\\, all the build up for Rey's character ended up with nothing\\, when she's in the Jedi temple with Luke she says :\\\" I've been here before\\\" the flashbacks from TFA all was nothing\\, the hacker detour completely unnecessary\\, the death of Luke unnecessary\\, the PO and the female admiral confrontation\\, build up-death of Fazma. So I'm not trolling and I am not against the change in the Saga's structure\\, but it has to be done right.","true":true}
