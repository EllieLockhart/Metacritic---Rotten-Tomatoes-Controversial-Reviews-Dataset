Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've seen the movie 3 times now. Mostly because I wanted to give it a second chance and then my fiance wanted to see it. I have come to the firm conclusion that this is a shame to the Star wars name and a completely awful story that proves Rian Johnson have zero talent.","true":true}
