Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best Star Wars films to date.\\nR. Johnson has tried to push the saga into new territory and I can understand why people are backfiring to that. After all the confort found in Episode VII and its hidden Episode IV reboot is not here anymore. But\\, tell me if I'm wrong but it was that precise reproach that we heard two years ago. So\\, sit back\\, enjoy the stunning visuals\\, the story that takes your beloved characters into new places and as Luke said \\\"just breathe\\\".\\nI'm sure that after a few months\/years people will see this movie for what it really is : a brillant and bold move that will be a fresh start for the next chapters in this saga.","true":true}
