Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a perfect example of why \\\"twists\\\" and \\\"surprises\\\" don't make a movie good. The twists felt more for shock factor than for the actual story line. Overall this movie was disappointing and could have been better.","true":true}
