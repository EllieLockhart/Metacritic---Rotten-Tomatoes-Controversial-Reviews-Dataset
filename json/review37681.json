Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There's many great things to be said about star wars the last jedi. However there's may negative things to say about this movie for example most of the humour didn't work. It has a whole segmant in the movie that didn't didn't feel all that needed in the end and it hurt the pace of the film and a couple other scenes that felt quite poor. Thankfully there are some great moments and performances and characters excel. And the scenes on the island were just so interesting.","true":true}
