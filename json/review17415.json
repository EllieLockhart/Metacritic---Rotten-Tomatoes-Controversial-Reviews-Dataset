Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw 'The Last Jedi' a couple weeks ago. The audience score seems pretty accurate to me. The main issue I have with this movie is that it's sloppy. I don't care what your politics are\\, if you tell a good story\\, I'll probably enjoy it. TLJ is simply an average popcorn flick with really nice special effects. Oh yeah\\, and the pacing and subplots are pretty bad.. See Blade Runner 2049 instead.","true":true}
