Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cinematically it\u2019s great but story is quite disappointing i don\u2019t know why they must add stupid jokes like the first scene with the \u201ccan you hear me now\u201d bit like I get he\u2019s supposed to be stalling or whatever but come on. Star Wars is supposed to be dark and emotional not cute with dumb jokes. it\u2019s like they tried to do \u201cStar Wars guardians of the galaxy\u201d like no Disney get your head out of your ass and make a rugged emotional dark yet beautiful film why do they disrespect Luke like this shouldnt luke be old and wise not a hermit because he has some of first books full of Jedi knowledge. if they don\u2019t fix Star Wars it\u2019s just gonna become transformers all over again just throwing movies out to make money because they know people will watch also it was very disappointing to just find out that Snoke was literally just some randy and dies the first time we actually get to see him it sad to see something end so quick without getting to figure him out. people need to let Disney know that this is not okay \\,but in all the negative about the movie there are still some great things about the movie like I love the characters I really do and it looks fantastic but Poe story telling it just felt they went all action with a thin plot I really really hope that Star Wars pulls through with there next movies.","true":true}
