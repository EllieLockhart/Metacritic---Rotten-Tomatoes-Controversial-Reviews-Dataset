Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A return to what made A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back great - emotionally driven\\, imaginative and visually stunning stories about space wizards and space nazis. Filled with lessons about war profiteering\\, failure\\, religion\\, love\\, and hope\\, and a breath of fresh air after decades of mediocre-to-bad entries in the series. It felt its length toward the end\\, but the emotional conflict between Rey\\, Ren and Luke and the fun side-plot of Finn and Rose (not to mention an excellent traitorous character portrayed by Benicio Del Toro) had me interested through every twist and turn!","true":true}
