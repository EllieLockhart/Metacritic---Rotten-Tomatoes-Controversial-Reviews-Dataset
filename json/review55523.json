Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Needed to see this a second time before I was able to score it. This film is probably the best Star Wars film ever AFTER the throne room. Johnson takes many risks. Some hit....some didn\u2019t. Don\u2019t let a score tell you if you like this or not. Go see it again. ","true":true}
