Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019m surprised by the fan backlash. I\u2019ve been a fan for over 30 years and absolutely loved it. I just love that the complaint about TFA was it was too derivative but the TLJ is too different or jumped the shark.","true":true}
