Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Although there seems to be a lot going on\\, from a story POV\\, it doesn't really make much headway and opts instead to focus on definitively setting a new course for the characters (speaking of\\, there's not a lot of development for them either\\, at least for the ones that the franchise is focusing on) moving forward. Without giving too much away\\, it's the decisions made in that general area that probably aren't going to go down well with devotees of the franchise. For casual fans\\, however\\, there should be enough laser-blasting\\, ship battles\\, lightsaber\\, and force-wielding action to give them that Star Wars thrill they're looking for. In short\\, it's your average Hollywood blockbuster: a poorly written story with poorly written characters\\, but with a lot of flashy action that doesn't fail to entertain. Take from that what you will.","true":true}
