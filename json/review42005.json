Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie made me change my mind: I used to hate President Trump but now I think he's exactly whats needed!\\n\\nWhile watching\\, I realised the propaganda garbage epitomised all the BS of the Obama\/Clinton administration. (It epitomises Oprah even more!)\\n\\nSo yeah\\, at least this movie was good for something!","true":true}
