Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS!!! Another movie in the series that is completely unrelated to the spirit of the Universe. Luke's personality is ruined. The amount of plot holes in this one is ridiculous. Kylo is as pathetic as in episode 7. And Snoke's characters is just wasted for no apparent reason but bad writing. Phasma wasted having under 30 seconds of dialogues in the entire movie. The entire movie is either a disrespect to SW fans or an open declaration of war to the wonderful reach universe. How can one ruin such a beautiful idea? How can one just take all the immense potential that the later episodes could have and turn them into an unwatchable crap? The amount of silly jokes that ruin supposed-to-be tense moments in the movie is outrageous.","true":true}
