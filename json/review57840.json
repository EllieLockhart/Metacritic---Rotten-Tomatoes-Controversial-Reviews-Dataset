Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Watched this in 3D and the visuals were great.  But that's where it ends\\, and the entire movie was a disappointment\\, and I'm not even a Star Wars fan.  There was a plot thread that took up half the movie and there was no pay off.   The plots and the story simply did not make any sense.   I also did not appreciate all the social justice and feminist agenda being rammed down my throat.  I did not pay good money to watch a Star Wars movie for any of that.  Will not buy the bluray\\, will not watch Solo\\, and will not watch episode 9.  I'll post on facebook\\, instagram\\, twitter\\, and all social media to encourage others not to support movies like this.","true":true}
