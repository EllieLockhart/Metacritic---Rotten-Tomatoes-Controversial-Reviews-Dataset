But it was performed in a way that all fans are supposed to feel on purpose and to make this as spoiler-free as possible without giving away too much. Here are my pros and cons of what I think of this game as a whole\r\rPros:\r\r1.) The gameplay is nice\\, fluid\\, and immersive to play\r\r2.) Graphics are nicely detailed and cinematically visual\/appealing\r\r3.) Sound designs are amazing\r\r4.) The story is epic and unique in a way that you thought you could never feel with such a high variety of emotions\r\r5.) Acting is phenomenal and highly underrated\r\rCons:\r\r1.) Part of the narratives in the story could've been changed for a better outcome\r\r2.) Some character developments needed some slight improvements\r\rVerdict: The Last Of Us Part 2 is a great game and originally I was gonna give this a 10 or 9 but with the story narratives making me feel bittersweet in some ways and thinking of what direction should the franchise go next if a Last Of Us Part 3 were to be made next in the future. Overall I give The Last Of Us Part 2 an 8\/10 simply because of the fact that I still had fun playing this game and the experience that I had with the story was really interesting to see. The last thing I want to mention is that for this review on Metacritic I'm gonna put the score as a 10\/10 since I want to be generous to show my support for the game and even though my actual rating is still an 8\/10 for me but in my opinion\\, I thought this felt right to do.  :)\u2026 Expand","true":true}
