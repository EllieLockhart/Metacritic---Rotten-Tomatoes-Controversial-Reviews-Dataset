Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Omg!! where do I begin!to be honest the graphics and the gameplay was like the first one.. amazing but the fact that they sell me this game like if I could play with joel angry me a lot!! i'm very confused right now\\, is this false advertising?how could you ruined one of the best game of the ps3 era! there's no point to kill joel so early in the game because he was the main character of the first one and the one I care about I don't give a **** about abby\\, second omg the finale!! is just a disappointment i can't stand this piece if **** I just wanted to kill abby that ****ing character and revenge Joel.. Guys if this game was about revenge  you game fail miserably. The third thing is how stupid Joel and his Brother were in the raid incident omg in the first game joel was more careful sharing information this is so stupid! and how he died is a brutality!Finally\\, 7 seven ****ing years i wait for this to come out only for get tricky and not to have the game that i thought could have\\, all this second part is a slap in the face for fans and a disrespect for the first one. Who thought this was a good idea in the first place omg this game is pathetic is a shallow of the first one it's a mess!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
