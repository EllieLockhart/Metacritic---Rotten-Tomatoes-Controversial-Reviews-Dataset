Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Only created an account so I could voice my displeasure towards this movie. \\nSeems pretty clear to me that the critics are employed by Disney because this was the WORST film by far in the entire franchise. Zero plot\\,terrible acting\\, and they totally ruined Luke. \\nAfter two hours of waiting for SOMETHING to happen you are left in the same spot you were after force awakens. No answers to anything.\\n\\nComplete joke of a Star Wars film.","true":true}
