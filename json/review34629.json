Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The character play was gripping\\, interesting and dynamic between the leads\\, but the storytelling of the OT characters (Luke\/Leia)\\, and some from Force Awakens (Finn\/Poe)\\, was a complete divergent within the series\\, not believable\\, and without any bridge.  A true letdown\\, almost walked out when Leia Poppins had her 'moment'.","true":true}
