Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the better Star Wars movies. The most morally ambiguous of the series. The acting was top-notch. The plot moved in new\\, exciting directions. Close to the best directed of the series\\, if not for a few things that could\u2019ve been cut. ","true":true}
