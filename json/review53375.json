Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Did Rian Johnson even watch the force awakens? This film ignored most of the plots set out in that movie\\, which was what actually kept that movie alive.... Instead you get feminism and SJW antifa rammed down your throat\\, all the men are pathetic\\,  particularly Luke who comes across as a bitter weak looser\\, the complete opposite of what luke really really is... In fact\\,  non of the Main charachters in this whole thing have been worth it other than WD using them to promote the films... Thats it.\\n\\nIt also got boring half way through\\,  the so called funny parts where out of place and and had a disrespectful vibe to it as if it was making fun out of star wars...  Rose is irritating and is clearly there as some chubby asian chick for yet even more unneeded \\\"diversity\\\" \\n\\nRey appears to be the best jedi that breaths despite having normal parants\\, no training or expirience.... Infact\\, what was all the \\\"my father was strong in the force\\, i was a strong in the force\\, and so nowso are you\\\"  (or what ever it was) in the adverts of TFA? Obviously just randomly used as a promo and just goes to show there has been no real understanding and direction for this whole project.... \\n\\nBotton line\\, they knew the money would come rolling in regardless so have used it to ram politics down our throats\\, crrwte new. Charachters for future projects with out a care in the world for the star wars universe or respect for the charachters that built it.  Frankly I don't think they give a damn.  No more Star Wars for me.","true":true}
