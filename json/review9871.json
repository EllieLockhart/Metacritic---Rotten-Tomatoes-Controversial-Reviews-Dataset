Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great and challenging movie for the fans! Loved what they did with Luke even though I didn\u2019t like it at first I understand now! I would give this movie honestly 4 stars instead of 5\\, but this movie gets way to much hate! After episode 9 explains some things that occur in 8 I believe the last Jedi will become a classic!
