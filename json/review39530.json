Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was AMAZING. A thrill ride from start to finish. The best parts were Rey and Kylo's OFF THE CHARTS CHEMISTRY. Incredible. I've seen it twice already and am planning to see it a third today. The character development is so well written\\, and the epic fight scene is INCREDIBLE. I hope they continue with Kylo and Rey's chemistry in 9\\, as it would be a disservice to TLJ if they do not. Everyone else's chemistry paled in comparison to Daisy and Adam together. INCREDIBLE.","true":true}
