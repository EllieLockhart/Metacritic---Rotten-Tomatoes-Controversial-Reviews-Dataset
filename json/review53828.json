Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Having seen the original film when it first came out in the late 70s\\, I felt I was seeing the story all over again: evil Empire; rebellion on its knees. Who will save the what is good in the universe ? I found this episode very long\\, badly acted in some cases and fairly tedious. The script was joyless and lacking humour. The bad guys pretty two-diimensional. All the ingredients including cute space animals but bland fare. The last film was entertaining but this time I went away feeling\\, for the first time\\, this franchise has gone on too long. Plenty of hints that there is more to come. Really it should stop now if we want to avoid cardboard characters  saying 'may the farce be with you.'","true":true}
