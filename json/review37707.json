Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The reviews are misleading.  Lucasfilm delivered an amazing film that many fans clearly hate because it wasn't predictable and took a lot of risks; the same thing they hated The Force Awakens for NOT doing.  I thought this film was amazing\\, beautiful\\, unexpected\\, and everything I didn't know I wanted it to be.","true":true}
