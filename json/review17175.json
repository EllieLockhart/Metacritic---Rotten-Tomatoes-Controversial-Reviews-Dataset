Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really liked the movie. I should watch it again perhaps\\, and I still need to think about everything\\, but the general Star Wars symbolism that I love so much was sooo there. \\n\\nCause and effect\\, we know how the Force works.\\n\\nI also had no problem with Luke's characterisation\\, which I know some disagree with. He's not the 23-year-old young Jedi who faced his father and the Emperor. So I never expected him to be exactly the way he used to be when he was younger. So it wasn't just seeing Luke again... it was learning who he was now\\, what he's been through since we last saw him\\, as opposed to who he used to be. Seeing the man too\\, not just the legend. He will always be my favourite and TLJ changed none of that.","true":true}
