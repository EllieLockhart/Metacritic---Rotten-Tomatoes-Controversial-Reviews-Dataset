Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a great action movie. Awesome sound and great visuals. \\nHowever\\, it feels like Rian Johnson didn't watch The Force Awakens\\, because there are so many plot-holes. Many of the \\\"high-profile\\\" characters is neglected\\, which confirms my suspicion about Rian Johnson prioritizes the trailer more than the actual movie. \\n\\nThis movie is a sad attempt to stretch a 1 hour plot into a 2.5 hour movie.","true":true}
