Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ryan johnson and Disney has decided to \\\"kill the past\\\" as is proclaimed by Sith Kylo Ren several times in the movie. The Star Wars franchises former celebration of heroic characters and good versus evil\\, has now been replaced with flawed characters of broken down spirits and a heavy dose of nihilism. It seems as though the director Ryan Johnson\\, has sacrifised the soul of the franchise\\, for the sake of him trying to convince the audience that Star Wars famously hopeful and idealistic messages\\, has always been juvenile and pathetic and that he was the chosen director\\, to bring balance to the f...franchise. I left the movie disapointed with an empty impression of the movie\\, which wasnt the case with the other interpretations from Disney. The movie feels like an insult to the legacy of the old movies and the fans. I wish this movie could be redone\\, not just because of the disrespectful character murder that Ryan Johnson committed on Luke Skywalker or the flawed logic\\, that desperately tried to justify his new ideology\\, but because of the great potential that the movie and its characters had. The dissonance between The Force Awakens and this movie is so perplexing\\, that im not really sure what this trilogy has tried to do so far and dont have a clue as to how JJ. Abrams can end it with the slightest resemblence of coherence. Regardless\\, for the first time in my life\\, im not really that exited to find out.","true":true}
