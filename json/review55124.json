Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was looking forward to the movie since seeing episode 7\\, but I was unimpressed by so much. Before I go through some of the bad let's start with the good. I thought the technology advancement like the mind melding and the tracking in light speed were brilliant. The acting overall was genuine and authentic. The story as a whole was underwhelming. I felt that everything that was built up in episode 7 was torn down in 8. Snok\\, Rey's family\\, the connection between Kylo and Rey was all just destroyed. I could go into more detail but others will have to make their own opinion.","true":true}
