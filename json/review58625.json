We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I enjoyed the game for 13 hours straight\\, yes\\, the story was not as compelling as that of the first title\\, but it was still good enough that it kept me motivated\\, plus my love for the characters pushed me forward to fulfill their objectives. I got scared\\, I was engaged\\, I was driven by anger\\, I felt that I was one with Ellie. I played the game at night\\, wearing headphones and with the lights off just to be as immersed in the game as possible\\, in short: I was having a fantastic experience\\, but then...\r\ri have no clue what went through Druckmann's mind\\, how in the hell would I want to play as Abby\\, it has nothing to do with her being the \\\"villain\\\" or the way anyone wants to interpret it\\, it is the fact that I have to go to the theater to kill Ellie\\, and I know I'm making it there because we are shown that they meet after 13 hours of playing with Ellie\\, so there is not even a shade of doubt regarding my objectives or destination.\r\rI am not going to mention the bad storytelling or the plotholes because I do not care about them\\, I could do with bad writing as long as I am playing as the people that i had learned to love 6 years ago. In the end\\, the 10 hours I played as Abby\\, to me\\, were not enjoyable\\, I stopped playing at night\\, I stopped wearing headphones and I did not care about anything about it\\, I paced through it in one day because I couldn't bring myself to play as her and to top it all off I have to bash Ellie's head in too\\, like WTF?\r\ri am really disappointed with this game\\, not just because I did not enjoy it\\, but because I had so much faith in ND to produce a game which would at least match the first one's level of emotion\\, and in turn I ended up hating the sequel to my favourite game ever.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
