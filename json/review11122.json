Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hi This movie was a travesty of epic proportions\\, too many plot holes. Too much politics\\, the critics are obviously paid for by disney and are afraid of an SJW backlash if they say anything negative. Nothing makes sense. Lukes dead\\, Hans dead\\, the force is dead. Force ghost yoda can summon lightening\\, the jedi texts are destroyed\\, Lukes lightsaber was destroyed\\, Rey is overpowered\\, Kylo Ren isa joke\\, Hux is a joke\\, Holdo has purple hair\\, Luke drinks milk from the titties of a space walrus\\, etc etc etc.","true":true}
