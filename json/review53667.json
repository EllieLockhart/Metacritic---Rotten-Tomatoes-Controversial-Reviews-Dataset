Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For me\\, this film was the breath of fresh air I needed. A horrible feeling had been creeping up on me\\, I was beginning to believe that Star Wars would become a stale\\, heartless\\, money-hungry franchise\\, that did not push for originality but stayed within the limits of our pre-conceived notions of what should happen and bowed down to the wishes of nostalgia-hungry fans.\\nRian Johnson's film completely shattered these fears\\, with bold and controversial choices in the plot-lines of characters old and new\\, surprising me at every turn.\\nAs a Star Wars fan\\, I am careful not to let my love of the series cloud my judgement\\, so I must admit that parts of the Finn and Rose story wandered off-piste a little\\, and perhaps even scuppered the pacing in a few moments. Also\\, the humour did seem a little forced and over-egged at times\\, but everyone has a unique sense of humour\\, of course\\, so I don't think I can criticise the film fairly for that.\\nNevertheless\\, these supposed flaws that others have been enraged by\\, are\\, in my opinion\\, completely overshadowed by the superb writing and directing choices throughout the film\\, which provided me moment upon moment to look back on in wonder and awe.\\nThank you Rian Johnson\\, for directing perhaps one of my favourite ever Star Wars films!","true":true}
