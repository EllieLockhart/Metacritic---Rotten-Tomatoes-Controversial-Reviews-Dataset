Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"If you were impatient to continue the deep stroy of TLOU focus on the bond between Ellie and Joel you might get disappointed with this game. While the gameplay is an enhance version of the original its repetitive when you are 15 hours into the game\\, with fewer puzzles and simply succession of infiltration\\, escape and murdering sequence. The graphics and audio are amazing\\, but the realism become sometime unbearable with extremly violent scenes throughout the game and also a few sexual scenes (which were poorly handled). The big disappointment however come with the story. Its simply a classic revenge plot\\, which make you follow Ellie for the first half\\, while the second half focus on a new character Abby who stole the spotlights\\, despite being the antagonist and the person to kill in the first half. And don't hope to continue your adventure with Joel. False advertising may show him in various sequence\\, but it was actually another character in this sequence or flashback. Joel is killed from the beginning\\, with no hope to save him\\, and the ending doesn't even give you the satisfaction to make revenge for Joel. Instead you let the murderer get away\\, and you watch Ellie abandonned by everyone\\, and thinking about killing herself to create a cure.\r\rDepressing and bad story kill this game for me.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
