Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"a lot of people are angry because they don't like that this movie didn't have the traditional star wars feel to it. honestly\\, i'm sorry for them\\, and that they can't accept that franchises have to evolve to keep things from getting stale. this movie was the first time i have ever thought that star wars had well developed characters and realistic and strong motivations\\, and i really appreciate that.","true":true}
