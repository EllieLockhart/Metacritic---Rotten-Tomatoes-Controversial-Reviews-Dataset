Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had this just focused on the new characters - all wonderfully portrayed - I would have thoroughly enjoyed this movie. But there's no getting around the fact that the fate it hands out to all the original Star Wars characters is utterly unlikable.  It's one thing to offer no challenges to an old crew\\, or ask them to pass on the torch\\, it's another thing entirely to say that their happy ending became twisted beyond repair and end their stories on a sour note.","true":true}
