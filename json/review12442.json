Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I cannot add anything\\, what has already been said by those lamenting covers it all. People are telling me STOP PINING FOR LUCAS IT'S NOT LUCAS.

Maybe they should stop trying to adhere to his formula...which is stupid because all he does it basic storytelling ( done very well )  yet everything Disney is doing falls short...nothing feels like it has consequences because the cast is constantly explaining the story to the view or cracking poor\\, avenger-style humor. \\n\\nErgh. That's all I'm writing. I hated it.","true":true}
