Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love Star Wars. I have the video games\\, movies\\, comic books\\, toys\\, and everything else. I even can appreciate the prequels though we all know they\u2019re not perfect movies. This\\, however\\, failed as a Star Wars movie for me. I walked out of the theater questioning if I even liked it\\, which I have never done before. It didn\u2019t make sense to me why I would have such feelings for a movie that had my beloved childhood characters in it. The reason was simply because of bad writing\\, inconsistencies with the plot\\, blatant disregard for characters and how they should act based on prior films\\, and seemingly no connection at all to the force awakens. A lot of these have been mentioned by others\\, but what really hurt me was the poor pacing and storytelling\\, making it bad as a film\\, not just as a Star Wars film. Sadly\\, i have no desire to see this again. I hope the rest of the franchise does not follow the path this movie paved.","true":true}
