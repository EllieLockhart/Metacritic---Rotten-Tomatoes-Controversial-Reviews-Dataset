Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film is stunningly beautiful and has an amazing soundtrack. It delivers twists and subverts expectations in some instances. \\nBut that's where the praise ends. \\nThe plot is flimsy and weak. There are too many forced\\, unnecessary plot points and conflicts that were not needed. \\nThe characters have been disgraced. Luke Skywalker is a joke of what he used to be\\, with his character apparently forgetting everything he did in the Original Trilogy. \\nLeia is majorly underused and has no real significance to the story. \\nThe story does a disservice to everything the characters had went through beforehand.","true":true}
