Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Way too many plot holes.  Story goes completely off the rails in several instances\\, characters don't stay true to their character\\, unreasonable or non-existent motives for many actions (or lack thereof) in the story for the sake of stretching a nonsense plot over an unnecessary amount of time.  Many unexplained instances of absolutely ridiculous behaviour.  Completely over saturated with try-hard comedic scenes.\\n\\nThis is more of a bad parody than a true Star Wars film.  Do not recommend for anyone looking for story integrity.","true":true}
