Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed this movie start to finish. As a long-time fan of Star Wars I love the direction they're going in and how there is no black and white anymore each character has Deep Emotions and flaws and second thoughts. The battle scenes were amazing ground and in space\\, the music is as masterful as always. The twists and turns in the story were welcomed and exciting. The acting of course was through the roof amazing! It had just enough humor in it to make it fun without it being remotely close to the prequels horrible humor. It was so good to see practical effects do used again!! I just simply enjoyed this more mature storytelling in the Star Wars universe without it needing to be dark injury the whole time.","true":true}
