Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a good movie. It was super fun and funny and epic. There really isn't much more I look for from a Star Wars movie! My only real critique is I wish they'd had more guts to actually kill characters.","true":true}
