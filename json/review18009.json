Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think \\\"The last Jedi\\\" has butchered it's source material. \\nIt's stunning visuals and great cast (inherited from force awakens) can not make up for its missed opportunities. \\nIt was the last chance to show the original cast together on screen. \\nLaila has been turned into Marry Poppins\\, BB8 is now a terminator and Luke the strange drunk uncle. \\nHowever I agree that the world isn't black or white\\, nether good or evil. But you can't apply it to a franchise that's core is based around redemption. We need black vs. white and bad guys turning good!","true":true}
