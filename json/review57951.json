Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When a Star Wars movie starts with an inter-galactic crank call\\, you know you are in for something special! Every installment of this ever increasing whimpering and whining saga has left me more and more\\, not disappointed\\, but disgusted. A crying\\, and then later shirtless\\, conflicted goth teenage Kylo Ren and the now fifty-something\\, and still whining Luke\\, chugging down some fresh blue milk literally makes me sick. How anyone could watch this nonsense and say it was good\\, let alone great leaves me speechless.","true":true}
