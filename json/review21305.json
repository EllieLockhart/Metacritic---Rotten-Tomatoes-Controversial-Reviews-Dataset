Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went in with low expectations thinking that they couldn\u2019t do worse than JarJar.... Unfortunately this movie is so much worse. The plot is almost nonexistent and boring. The best advice I can give is don\u2019t waste your money\\, watch the originals on tv if you\u2019re craving Star Wars.","true":true}
