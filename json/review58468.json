Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"'Almost' everything about it was absolute garbage. The whole point of the OT was for Luke to learn to become a jedi and a responsible full blown adult with control over his emotions and the ability to help support his friends and family. This movie spits in the face of that. They wasted some of the great characters introduced in TFA and it was like they bent over backwards to make some of the new characters unlikable. The only good thing about the movie was the acting.\\n\\nPlot holes and completely unnecessary plot twists and lines were soooo numerous. The empire built the biggest ships in the galaxy but they're not as fast as smaller ships and so any time they need to catch someone they're supposed to just follow and wait for them to run out of gas? WTF?\\nRey and Kylo were the only okay\/good part of this movie. The throne room fight was excellent but at the end of it they took this amazing situational setup they created and tossed it over their shoulder like it was an old lightsaber they were somehow not interested in.","true":true}
