Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Perhaps the worst Star Wars movie ever made. I don't honk Arian Johnson has ever seen a Star Wars movie. The force awakens and last Jedi ruined the franchise. This movie took what was like a bad fan fiction. I'm not even going to watch the 9th one this killed Star Wars for me.","true":true}
