Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is an absolute masterpiece. With the nostalgic music\\, background easter eggs\\, to the overlaying story twists. The twists and compelling additions to characters previously seen as empty\\, and weak. The provoking story and overall plot development brings the Star Wars movie franchise to new light. Cheers.","true":true}
