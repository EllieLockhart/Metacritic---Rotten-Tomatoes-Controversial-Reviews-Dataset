Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How do you mess up having Mark Hamill back as Luke Skywalker? Disney can try to sell this as some out of the box thinking but no. Just no. Walked out of there thinking WTF was that. Not because of what a wonderful unexpected journey. Never thought I'd see a Star Wars movie with Mark Hamill in it suck. Not because of you Mark. You tried to warn us.","true":true}
