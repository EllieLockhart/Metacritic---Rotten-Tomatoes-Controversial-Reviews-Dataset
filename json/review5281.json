Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Definitely a must watch. Those who are not deep star wars fans will love it. Those that are will have slightly different opinions This is my opinion of the movie. At first I loved it. Like as soon as it was done I was in love. Then I got in my car and I started thinking back on things that happened\\, and the hype went down a little. Then I looked at Reddit and started remembering and reflecting on the movie more. Then I hated it. But I found this one post (https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StarWars\/comments\/7klj1h\/spoilers_rian_johnsons_many_levels_of_tlj_and_the\/) that appealed to the theme and direction of the movie. It explained what Johnson was doing and my outlook on this movie boosted back up to positive. I am going to see it for a second time on the 27 so we shall see if my opinion changes once again. Overall I think it is a must watch. Amazing movie.","true":true}
