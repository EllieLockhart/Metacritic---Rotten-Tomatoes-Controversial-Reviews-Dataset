Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not the Star Wars you're looking for. Too many weird moments\\, ex machina\\, and Canto Bight. \\n\\nNever really felt any of the cast was in danger. Luke's story was a major disappointment. \\n\\nThe best part was anything to do with  Kylo\/Rey.","true":true}
