Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Johnson\\, did a great job of honoring the legacy of \\\"Star Wars\\\"\\, while making it an awesome experience for those new to the series. The writing was tight\\, and the direction really brought out the best in the actors. As fan of Mark Hamil's voice work\\, it was nice to see that come through to Luke","true":true}
