Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved the movie. I was spoiled before going in\\, but not once did knowing what was coming hamper my enjoyment\\, because it was still a surprise how it was coming. Better than Force Awakens\\, a great sendoff for Leia and Carrie Fisher.","true":true}
