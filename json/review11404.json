Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible horrible plot! No real character development\\, poor Luke was treated with such disrespect. I have been waiting forever to see him back on the cinema screen only to be so disappointed! I have been wanting to see Leia use some force powers\\, but maybe be superman (or superwoman)...\\\"That's not how the Force works!\\\"...all the sudden Rey is this all powerful Jedi with no training or real sacrifice on her part. Fin and Poe both take back seat to Rey-lo arc. I wouldn't have minded Luke dying in Episode 9 or if they had given him more screen time in Episode 8 training Rey\\, but the way they did it here was just horrible!","true":true}
