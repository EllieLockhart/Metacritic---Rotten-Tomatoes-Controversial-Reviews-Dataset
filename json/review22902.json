Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Look up Mauler's review of this garbage on youtube. He speaks for all of us (at least me\\, anyway)  that absolutely hated this film. I am NOT a Racist or Misogynist or Homophobic.  I am a Star Wars Fan since I was 6 and loved the STORY\\, the CHARACTER arcs\\, and the RESPECT of its own LEGACY and the UNIVERSALITY of the Saga.  NONE of which was in this movie .","true":true}
