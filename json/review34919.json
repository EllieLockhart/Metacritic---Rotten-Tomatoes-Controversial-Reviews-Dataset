Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film is definitely worth a watch and is highly entertaining but if you think about the film with a critics eye\\, you will see some elements that were underutilised and 1 big plot hole.\\n\\nPOSITIVES\\n+Mark Hamill is fantastic here as Luke and steals the show\\n+Adam Driver (Kylo) and Daisy Ridley (Rey) shine here also\\, their interactions and development are easily the best part of the movie\\n+Visually brilliant as expected. There is one scene involving Luke in particular that I guarantee will be a popular poster\\, you'll know it when you see it.","true":true}
