Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After the first one I really didn't want to believe everyone who said Rey is a Mary Sue and held out hope that I would see her go from promising if not lucky force user to someone that has force abilities but understands that she has a way to go. Nope. She's a mary sue. Seeing Yoda was nice so it has that going for it.","true":true}
