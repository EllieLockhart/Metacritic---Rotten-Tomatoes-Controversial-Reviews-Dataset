Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"AWFUL MOVIE!\\n\\nThe reason this movie was even allowed to make it to the big screen is Kathleen Kennedy and Lucasfilms SJW mission to tear down everything that was male and turn it on it's head.\\n\\nLook at the agenda for the men:\\n\\nHan = loser father who only cares for himself and neglects Leia and Ben\\nPoe = Cocky pilot who is impulsive and uses emotion instead of logic to make decisions\\nLuke = This is the worst\\, sorry every male that ever loved Star Wars\\, your hero and childhood idol is a weak coward\\, who went against everything he stood for. He's a angry\\, weak in the force\\, loser who needs a women to change him back or yoda\\nFinn = another coward who is still running until at the end he shows some courage only to show that a woman needs to save him\\n\\nNow the women:\\n\\nRey = A woman that needs no force training\\, she's just the best ever\\, better than Luke\\, Anakin\\, EVERYONE... Just a Natural\\nLeia = Needs no force training\\, she's just our new super space flying jedi who shows more force ability than Luke... Again\\, with no training.\\nHoldo = Saves everyone and becomes a hero while putting that cocky pilot in his place.\\nRose = Hero that saves Finn (male) character\\n\\nIf you can't see this trend of tearing every male into a trash\\, weak character and destroying everything they stood for then you are blind. Look at Rogue One... Jyn Erso.. HERO. No males! Apparently we had our time so instead of transitioning with a new series they tear our hero's to cowards that are weak and useless without women.\\n\\nWTF happened to Star Wars... It's clear\\, Kathleen Kennedy's SJW agenda along with Disney. Terrible movie! RIP Star Wars!!!! I'm done","true":true}
