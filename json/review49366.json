Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars production ever made. The hubris of Rian Johnson to not even respect the OT\\, but the film that came before his too? Forget about all the burning questions and theories you had about TFA\\, because its all destroyed in this film\\, just like Luke Skywalker was destroyed as a character. Thank god they're getting JJ Abrams back for the next film... and I never thought I'd be saying that.","true":true}
