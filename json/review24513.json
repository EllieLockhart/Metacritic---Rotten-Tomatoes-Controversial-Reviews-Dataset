Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Most of the complaints\\, about plot\\, writing and that major portions of the film rendered itself useless\\, posted are mine too but I haven't seen anyone mention how Disney has made every male characters completely incompetent. It's as if they need to tear them down to make the female characters better and actually introduce new characters to ruin established ones. As a life long Star Wars fan\\, I felt completely alienated. We aren't even left with a villain we can love or love to hate. I don't see to many young males wanting to be any of these characters next Halloween.","true":true}
