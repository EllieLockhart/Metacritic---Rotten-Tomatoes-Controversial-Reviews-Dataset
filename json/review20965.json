Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was in a crowded theater in Hollywood\\, lots of young kids\\, the movie was two and a half hours long\\, there was not a peep from anyone the whole movie\\, that says a lot.\\n\\nI have been a Star Wars fan from the first scenes of the first film\\, so for me this was as good as it gets. \\n\\nThe casting was great\\, and to see Mark Hamill again was a real treat. \\n\\nThere is a whole new generation falling in love with Star Wars\\, that's fantastic.","true":true}
