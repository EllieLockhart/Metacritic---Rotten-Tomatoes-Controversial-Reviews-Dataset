{"101487":179885,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-25","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst star wars film ever made\\, no flow of the plot\\, destruction of the old cast\\, recycling of past star wars scenes. SPOILERS AHEAD\\, the use of the fleet is being destroyed scene episode 6\\, the Falcon flying through the cave is also taken from ep6 with the destruction of the second death star\\, the use of furry friendly animals sympathetic to the rebellion makes me gag\\, Snoke was killed off in tbe dumbest way possible with no answers to who he is not that i care anymore\\, leia turning into a master force user and defying the laws of space which seems to be a common problem in this film\\, lukes character goes again everything he is suppose to be mark was right but I didnt think he would be that right\\, The female roles as with any gender would have been good if the script and acting was good however it was not\\, Rose is a new Jar Jar but talks too much\\, purple hair lady has the whole im a female and you should trust me without me telling you the plan causing Poe to stage a mutiny\\, easily avoidable. Yoda felt wrong but nothing negative to say other then why the random lightening strike. Rey is a Mary Sue there is nothing i can remotely relate with her she is handed everything\\, bests Luke in combat in a fight she started\\, matches or surpasses Ren in force knowledge with less then a week of training. ep7 felt like it never happen\\, somehow the first order has a endless economy bringing 2-3 superships into battle both being pretty much destroyed by single people purple haired lady and Poe. Rather then edit the movie so Carrie fisher died what could have been a emotional scene the messed it up big time and now she has to die off screen. Now for the worst part the moment i cried out fuck this movie cause i couldnt take anymore insult to my childhood\\, Luke comes to save the rebellion and Leia building to a epic fight\\, faces off the hoth copycat army and brushes off a barrage of lazer fire literally\\, Ren faces luke alone and luke almost word for word speaks Obi Wans last words to Vader not even fighting Ren to this point\\, Ren tries to strike luke but it turns out he just made a force vision of himself he is still on the island. The ordeal strains him so much that it kills him\\, the greatest jedi dies from creating a vision of himself. Why wouldnt you just have him go to the planet himself if you were gonna kill him. Im done with disney star wars.","true":true}
