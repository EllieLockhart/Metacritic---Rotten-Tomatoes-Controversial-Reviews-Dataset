Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If Han Solo returns then it is definitely worth 5 Star. I haven\u2019t seen the 3\\, Han Solo\\, Luke Skywalker and our dear Princess Leia on scene together for a long time. Although this is Carrie Fisher final film\\, what a great way to end her character.","true":true}
