Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was so disappointed with how they set up little sub plots in TFA but totally ignored them in TLJ! Changed Luke\u2019s character completely and far too many misplaced jokes! The pacing of the movie was all wrong! An hour in I was bored! The film dragged for me! The director could have made this an epic but decided to ignore the last film and set up his own trilogy after this one! I\u2019m not looking forward to episode 9! I\u2019ve never walked out of a Star Wars film and felt it was boring! Sad times! ","true":true}
