Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I made an account to review this movie. This is an absolute abomination and a heartbreak of a movie. It has completely ruined Star Wars and many peoples lives. I will probably will be depressed for a long time for how angry I am at this film and Kennedy and Johnson. \\n\\nAlso Disney and Rotten Tomatoes\\, I am rating this 1 and 1\/2 stars so that it counts in the rating. Its a disgrace that money is accepted from Disney to hide bad reviews when this movie STILL sits at 47% audience score. And then\\, more money is payed to media companies to blame this 47% rating on bots when the rating should actually be lower. I would rate this movie 0 if I could.","true":true}
