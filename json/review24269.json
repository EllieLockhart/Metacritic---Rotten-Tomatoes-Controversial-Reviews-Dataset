Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Men are dummies and only good for blowing things up\\, running away\\, getting people killed and disappointing women.\\n\\nWomen are cool\\, calm\\, collected\\, smart\\, better leaders and heros. They don't even need to wear military outfits because ball gowns are so much classier for generals to wear while suicide bombing enemies.\\n\\nLame writing\\, lame directing and progressive anti-white agenda pushed while assassination of Luke's character all helped make this the worst Star Wars yet.","true":true}
