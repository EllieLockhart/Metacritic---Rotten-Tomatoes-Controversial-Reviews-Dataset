Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If I have to choose between \\\"a steaming pile of Sith\\\" (AKA Rogue One) and \\\"now for something completely different\\\" (AKA The Last Jedi) I will take something completely different. I feel embarrassed to say it\\, but for the first time since watching The Empire Strikes Back\\, Star Wars has a plot that I never saw coming. There is a story arc in this film that could have been completely done away with to save budget\\, close a plot hole and reduce the run time by about half an hour\\, but other than that this is the best Star Wars film since Empire. Nothing's perfect\\, plenty of flaws here\\, a bit messy\\, but I've been a fan since I was single-digits old and you know what? I wasn't loving the film then for plot advancement\\, writing and pacing. I was a fan of fantastic battles\\, of crazy explosions in outer space\\, inhuman powers and a struggle of identity and power. The originals are messy and not perfect examples of film either. After seeing all the prequels\\, the theatrical re-releases in the 90's\\, etc... this is the first time something new has awe-struck me like when I was a 6 year old sitting slack jawed\\, three feet away from a CRT TV with a grainy VHS copy of A New Hope on screen and John Williams blaring out of tinny speakers. \\n\\nThe bad? Forced humor\\, heavy handed political messaging\\, and a WTF story arc that proves a COSTLY mistake for a few main characters. If Disney gets a message from the negative reviews of this film\\, I hope those are the issues they address in the ninth film.\\n\\nScrew the haters\\, this imperfect film (like most of them) gave me some hope that at least I'll be entertained by the revival of this classic cinematic universe. I may see this twice.","true":true}
