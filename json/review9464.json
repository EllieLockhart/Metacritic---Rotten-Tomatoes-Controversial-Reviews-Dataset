Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good acting...great special effects...but a story that was incompetently written.  You would think that SOMEBODY would be in charge of protecting this great franchise.  It's as though someone threw out a great painting because they wanted the beautiful frame for a picture of their mother.","true":true}
