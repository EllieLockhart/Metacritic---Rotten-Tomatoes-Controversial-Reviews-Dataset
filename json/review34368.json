Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The bad jokes\\, the bad acting of the new cast\\, the useless characters\\, the Luke we longed for and the Luke we got were lightyears away. Super Leia was a super joke. Really wished they used Kevin J Anderson as some form of consultant. There was some nice action but without a good story to go with it\\, it just feels like some stunt choreography. If only 7\\,8\\, & 9 we're about finishing this saga instead of trying to revamp a new cash flow. Make the origional cast the main and the new cast the supporting. then use them in new story lines. why ruin this? \\nI wish Gareth Edwards had been the director for these film's. \\n I'm sorry Disney but I've lost all hope.","true":true}
