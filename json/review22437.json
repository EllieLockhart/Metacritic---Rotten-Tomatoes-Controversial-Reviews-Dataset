Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Left the cinema very disappointed\\, even had a few literal \\\"face palm\\\" moments in the film. \\nFar too much slapstick throughout the film\\, it was almost like having Jar Jar back. \\nLooking back on the prequels\\, experienced Jedi were killed easily by droids\/ clones but an untrained Leia somehow survived in the vacuum of space and managed to save herself superman style! \\nThe part where Finn was heading towards the cannon in the speeder\\, he is heading full speed while everyone else peels off but somehow he is saved at the last minute by one of the previously mentioned speeders that caught up to him\\, it's not possible. At this time they didn't know Luke was there so as far as they knew the rest of the revels were now as good as dead.\\nSnoke\\, who is he? Where is he from? How is he so strong with the force! Oh well doesn't matter now. \\nAs for no one responding to the SOS call\\, where is Lando? Both TFA and now TLJ have not answered why after blowing up Death Star mk 2 the rebels numbers diminished yet the empire aka first order has gotten even bigger!","true":true}
