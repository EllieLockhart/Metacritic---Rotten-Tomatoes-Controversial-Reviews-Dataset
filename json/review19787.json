Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was an ok movie\\, but full of cheesy moments that cheapened it\\, terrible plot lines\\, terrible villains\\, mostly terrible heroes\\, etc.\\n\\nI'm dissapointed this was a star wars movie\\, it would have been fine as any other movie.","true":true}
