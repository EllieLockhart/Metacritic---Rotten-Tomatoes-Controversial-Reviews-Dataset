Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this movie was on the cusp of greatness. There were some moments in the movie that were a bit disbelieveable based on previous Star Wars history and a sequence that I didn't particularly enjoy\\, but as a whole\\, it was an exciting\\, new\\, and different chapter in the saga. Waiting for the next one to see where exactly they go from here! ","true":true}
