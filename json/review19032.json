Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It seems to have divided opinions among Star Wars fans\\, but a lot of the criticism seems to be from fans of the terrible prequels\\, people who wanted to see the original characters doing more\\, people who have a problem with women and\/or people with different skin colour to them\\, people upset because their fan theories weren't correct\\, and people who lack the experience or imagination to understand how characters might have developed. It's not a perfect film\\, but it's thoroughly enjoyable\\, full of surprises\\, humour\\, new ideas and great moments. For me\\, one of the best in the series\\, definitely better than the prequels (easy enough)\\, but also better than TFA and Rogue One.","true":true}
