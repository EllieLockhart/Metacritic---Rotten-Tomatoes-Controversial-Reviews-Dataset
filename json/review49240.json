Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie in the saga. Let's take some Star Wars characters and try to do a remake of Battlestar Galactica. No world building\\, no compelling new characters\\, a lousy plot\\, terrible dialogue. \\n\\nLet's take the baddest Jedi of them all and turn him into a pussy. It pains me to say this but this movie was terrible.","true":true}
