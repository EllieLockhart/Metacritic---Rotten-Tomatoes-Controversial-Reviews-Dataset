Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"movie was good. parts in the middle dragged. kylo\\, ray\\, and luke parts were amazing. lots of wow moments. there were many parts I liked and a few parts that I wish could be removed. over it is a good middle movie. unsure what is going to occur in episode 9.","true":true}
