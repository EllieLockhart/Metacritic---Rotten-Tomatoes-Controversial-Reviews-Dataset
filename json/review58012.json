Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While not much of an improvement upon its predecessor in the \\\"been there\\, done that\\\" category--in fact\\, some similarities may be more frighteningly familiar to fans since it doesn't draw as much from the entire Star Wars universe as it simply does from the original trilogy rather than its derivatives (i.e. despite how they may chalk something up as a \\\"salt\\\" planet rather than an ice planet...)--and it does seem as though the majority of the time is spent stalling for time when\\, in fact\\, we could've been developing the plot a little more\\, since the previous movie jumped the gun by giving us the object of our desire in Luke's arrival one movie too early anyway. On the other hand\\, since character development is something we really still need\\, I guess that's precisely what we got\\, even if it meant seeing the characters we want to evolve struggle through their darker ambitions or fleetings even more to get there. That said\\, the problem concocted by The Force Awakens still persists: proficiency in force training or lightsaber handling need not apply\\, even in rarer styles. Makes you wonder why there was ever a Jedi Academy in the bloody first place. Useless Jedi Masters.... Anyway\\, so regardless of whether characters live or die\\, or plots twist and turn\\, you're still convinced there could be a better way direct the script\\, since the dialogue is pretty ugly; to get the job done (perhaps some better CGI too\\, since the puppeteering sucked); and to let us get to know some characters instead of just one-shot-and-done. There's also the question of where the hell these guys get their information in the first place (e.g. um\\, since the info perished with the original order... how the hell does Luke know who Darth Sidious is anyway!?). Disney's certainly got some 'splaining to do....","true":true}
