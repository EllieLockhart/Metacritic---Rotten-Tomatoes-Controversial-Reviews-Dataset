Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mark Hamill has the star power of a homeless person and his acting was better than most with the exception of Rey and a few others. Each scene was excruciatingly stretched to be much longer than it should have been. How many times were we told the rebellion was low on fuel? Yawn. It is like a committee wrote the script with a lot of input from their children. Painful movie\\, I couldn't wait for the end. This is not what I wanted from a Star Wars movie....a bunch of negative philosophizing. The \\\"Empire\\\" may have written this script.","true":true}
