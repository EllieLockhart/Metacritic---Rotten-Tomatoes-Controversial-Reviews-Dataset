Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved the new movie and I've seen it 5 times and counting! Sure I was upset that Lupe died but that is the way of things and that's what happened to both Obi-wan & Yoda as well they turned into force ghosts. Luke will be back as force ghost in Episode 9. Leia was to have been the central character that Episode 9 focused on in trying to save her son Ben Solo\\, from the dark side. I wonder how this will play out now? Was Leia to have died as well just like Han & Luke before? See the move again and you will enjoy it more. Trust me. You will notice things you didn't see in your first viewing.","true":true}
