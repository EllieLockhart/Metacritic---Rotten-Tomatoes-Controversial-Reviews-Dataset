Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Personally\\, I think the deviation from the tired old trope we saw beaten to death in The Force Awakens is a stroke of intelligence\\, and people hating on this movie are quite frankly doing so out of a limited mindset.  Then again\\, Disney declaring all non-movie plot lines non-canon is also out of a limited mindset\\, so they're also at fault here.  But this is a genuinely good movie that doesn't just relive the glory days like The Farce Engorges did.  Good on J.J. Abrams for taking a bit of a step back here.  It definitely made a difference.","true":true}
