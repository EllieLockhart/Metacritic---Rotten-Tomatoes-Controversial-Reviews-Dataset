Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie. The effects are great and the acting itself is not bad at all but I am sick of tired of political messages in my movies. The movie had useless subplots and horrible plot holes. Beloved characters are not acting like themselves. Just terrible.","true":true}
