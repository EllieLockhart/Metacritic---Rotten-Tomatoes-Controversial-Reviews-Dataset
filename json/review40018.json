Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is literally my new favorite star wars movie. There seem to be a lot of haters here and thats because Rian Johnson decided not to force shove a bunch of fan service down our throats this time. He broke the mold in a bold and refreshing way. Also many people are probably pissed about Rey's parentage. They need to move on.","true":true}
