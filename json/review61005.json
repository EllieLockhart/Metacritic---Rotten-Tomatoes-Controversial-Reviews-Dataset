The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"THIS IS MY FIRST REVIEW OF A PS4 GAME.\r\rI just finished the game. All I can say\\, game is bad overall. When you talk games like TLOU generally\\, you talk about a \\\"story\\\" not \\\"gameplay\\\". While gameplay plays a big part\\, story plays a bigger one.\rStraight forward\\, ND destroyed the game. They forced agendas upon their players knowing TLOU had a lot of fans\\, and the game grew so much in those seven years gap.\rWhat they did to get their money was false marketing the *STORY*. Check the latest \\\"reveal date\\\" trailer from them. They painted the game as if you'll play with Ellie now she's grown up\\, while having Joel alongside later in the game\\, and that never happened.\rLast of \\\"Us\\\" always meant to me as two characters: Ellie and Joel. Now I don't disagree with killing Joel\\, but he deserved much **** better. We fell in love with his character\\, and you killing him off just to push some agenda in the first 2 hours is what I call killing off the **** game.\r\rI was one of those who defended the game before playing it\\, but now that I did and finished it\\, all I can say I'm sorry for doubting the haters\\, because I'm one\\, too.\r\rAND that aside\\, fans expected lots  answers: Why is Ellie immune? What happened to the world? The cure? They left a lot of **** just to push some agenda\\, which I'm okay with\\, but completely **** unnecessary\\, especially in a video game like this.\r\rBut hey I learnt a lesson here which is never preorder a game\\, especially from PS dog**** store. I wasted $60\\, and I will regret paying ND this **** much for this ****ty game.\r\rNow\\, I want a dev or a storyteller who was part of TLOU 2 making to actually make a video explaining the meta behind the writing of this **** story. How can you even come up with this trash? Were there ever QA involved here? DID ANYBODY IN THIS COMPANY TEST THIS GAME AND THOUGHT \\\"OH WE SHOULDN'T DO THAT.\\\" ?!\r\rI'm so **** triggered. I wish I could refund this. Nice kill\\, Naughty Dog.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
