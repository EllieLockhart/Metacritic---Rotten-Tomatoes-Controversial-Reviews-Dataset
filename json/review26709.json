Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"ok so i've tried to calm down after a few months to give this movie a balanced and rational review.  but instead i am more furious than when i first exited the movie theatre.  i feel betrayed.  this was just a bang average movie. this is kind of forgivable if it wasn't a star wars movie\\, but it isn't.  star wars is about great story telling. and this was just so terrible\\, i wan'ted to take my son immediately out of the theatre to a galaxy far far away.  just a really terrible movie. shame on you lucas!","true":true}
