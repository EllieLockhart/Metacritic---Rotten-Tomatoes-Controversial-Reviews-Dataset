Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So ridiculously\\, unforgivably\\, unfathomably\\, horrendously atrocious and bad. Forget 'The Last Jedi' I hope this is 'The Last Star Wars Movie made by Disney'! This film has just destroyed everything about the original trilogy\\, the legacy. Add to that it insults my intelligence and betrays the real genuine Star Wars fans. As far as I'm concerned\\, this whole trilogy is NOT canon. I will do my best to pretend it never even happened\\, IF I can get over the trauma of it all! oh and screw ALL of these paid professional reviewers who are just brown nosing Disney and Hollywood who unbelievably have given it a 92% score. What a disgusting state this is. To sum it all up in one word\\, UNFORGIVABLE.","true":true}
