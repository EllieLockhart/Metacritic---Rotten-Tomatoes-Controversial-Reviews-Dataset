Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was awesome to put it shortly. I ending was great by living us with the possibility of younglings coming back. People who hate the movie never grew up loving the original films and like most young people today\\, they just wanted something to complain about.","true":true}
