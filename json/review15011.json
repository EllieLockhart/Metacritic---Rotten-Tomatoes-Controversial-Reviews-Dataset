Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I know a lot of self described \\\"Star Wars Fans\\\" are bashing this film\\, but it seems to me almost all of their complaints boil down to \\\"I hate that women matter\\\" or \\\"Why didn't they do what I expected them to do.\\\" Needless to say these are very poor people to take reviews from unless you also hate women or only want to watch a film you yourself made. \\n\\nOn the flip side this is a great movie. Very funny\\, Very stunning visually. Full of surprises and awesome moments that will illicit audible outbursts of excitement. There are truly some of my favorite moments in a Star Wars film ever in this film. \\n\\nDoes that mean it is perfect? No. It is flawed. It's pacing is a clear problem and could have been much shorter without question. Some of the character growth and side stories are overdone and brought little to the table. One character in particular I personally feel should have been allowed to die but again not my movie. \\n\\nOverall though this film follows very much in the tradition\\, mythology\\, lore and dogma of star wars and pushes the franchise forward in new and exciting ways. Could things have been done better\\, sure. But were they done wrong\\, no. Trust the critics see this film. But maybe leave your bias and expectations at the door.","true":true}
