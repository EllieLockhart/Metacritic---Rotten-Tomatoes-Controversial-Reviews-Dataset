Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"'Meh Wars' - a poor sequel to Episode 7 that wibble-wobbles with the Force.\\n\\nTedious and too many unfunny scenes (no one in the cinema laughed or chuckled). The key problems with this new trilogy is too many characters being introduced and not enough development on the key ones only minor progress. The introduction of Rose was the only interesting new character in this film and Poe does develop a little. Sadly\\, Finn is still underused. Like many films\\, the villains are undeveloped and underused leaving them just to be something to fill the time in. \\n\\nAnother issue seen with this trilogy is the scalability between the 'First Order' and the 'Resistance' is too great between them.\\n\\nDialogue and the one liners are still poor in writing. \\n\\nAs for the surprising twists there isn't any really\\, it is more to get rid of some of Episode 7 subplots.  \\n\\nWhile Episode 7 may not have made me pick up on the merchandising did make me interest in seeing Episode 8\\, Episode 8 has made me not care for Episode 9 and a definite avoid all associated merchandising as if it were steaming Bantha fodder.","true":true}
