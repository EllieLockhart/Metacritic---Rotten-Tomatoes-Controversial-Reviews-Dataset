Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Narratively Incoherent. That's the term I think that best describes this movie. The entire plot hinges on a canon-breaking\\, unexplained mcguffin. Which\\, just leads to some kind of slow-motion chase\\, that spans the majority of the run-length of the movie. Even if we buy the absurd premise for this scenario\\, it requires the willful suspension of common sense to accept that it goes on as long as it does (Seriously\\, has no one in the First Order been in the military for longer than five minutes? Here's a thought\\, jump ahead of them and set up a blockade). The scenario seems to exist solely as a merchandising ploy to introduce a mumbling Benicio Del Toro action figure\\, and Space-LLamas. Say what you will about the prequels\\, at least they were coherent. These are just the most egregious offenses. \\nThen there's the humor; there's about twice as many corny jokes as this movie can feasibly get away with. And the music; don't get me wrong\\, the JW score is what it is\\, and will always be iconic\\, but it's a high-drama score\\, and too many times it seems pasted over mundane scenes to artificially amp-up tension in situations that otherwise would be meh. Rounding it out\\, we've got wasted characters\\, unnecessary new characters(Rose seems to exist solely to deliver the most god-awful line of the entire franchise)\\, and an ending that just...well\\, I'm not even sure how to describe it\\, because I really don't know what I saw.\\nThis movie was just bad\\, by any measure.","true":true}
