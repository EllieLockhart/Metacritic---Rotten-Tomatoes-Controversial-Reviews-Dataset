Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So unless it was all a force dream there's nowhere to go. Mary Rey already beat Kylo. They set up nothing in 8. Only a reboot will fix this trainwreck. I'll gladly pass on SW Ep9 pt1 & pt2- you know they'd split the last movie if they knew it would bring in more money.","true":true}
