Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"BEST MOVIE EVER. The only reason it has low rating is because theese fan boys and theorists gone mad cuz all their theories were wrong and because they cant accept something different from all other star wars movies. Most of them are pissed out because luke and snoke died but i was like OMG when snoke died and I think seeing a force projection on movie was way cooler than another lightsaber battle. When I was watching for the first time I thought that luke is a SUPERJEDI when nothing could kill him but then it turned out it was a force projection and I was laughing because he trolled kylo so badly.....","true":true}
