But not only is it a terrible sequel by (literally) spitting on everything established in the first game in order to form its own narrative\\, but is a plothole-ridden mess that\u2019s subversive for the sake of subversiveness and has a hypocritical message that leaves you with nothing more than an ultimately unsatisfying ending. I\u2019d even be fine with Abby if she was actually a great and well-written character\\, but she\u2019s not. I don\u2019t hate her because of a certain thing she does at the beginning of the game\\, but because the game tries so hard to force you to care for her despite being an an irredeemable psychopath who makes idiotic decisions and literally gets euphoria from killing people. Joel wasn\u2019t the most likable character out there\\, I\u2019ll admit\\, but I could at least still sympathize and empathize with him due to what he\u2019s lost. Abby on the other hand is nothing more than a selfish brat who\u2019s backstory is only partially explored in flashbacks and nothing more. To put the cherry atop the inedible ice cream\\, you play as her for half the game\\, and so you\u2019re stuck with this character you just want nothing to do with for a good portion of its 25-hour runtime. So since since it\u2019s a story-based game and the story is awful\\, I can\u2019t give it anything above a 4\/10. As a huge fan of the first game and one that has it as one of my all-time favorite games\\, disappointment can\u2019t even begin to describe what I feel right now. I honestly just wish Naughty Dog didn\u2019t make a sequel in the first place\\, especially since TLOU didn\u2019t even really need one\\, and this along with their workplace crunch and misleading marketing of the game have definitely put me off of purchasing any of their products in the future.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
