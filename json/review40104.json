Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not a Star Wars movie and craps all over the franchise. The plot is terrible and this film is a mess. Beloved characters are miss handled\\, humor is bad and movie is full of cheap movie tricks and gotcha moments. This is so bad I would not recommend people even see it. This is a huge disappointment for me. I give it .5 star for the visuals but movies need to be more than the effects. The future of Star Wars is in serious jeopardy. Disney should be ashamed.","true":true}
