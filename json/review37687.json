Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There's not much I can say about a new\\, numbered Star Wars release that won't already have been said\\, especially with the backlash occurring sooner and sooner post-release. But I will say this: I both love the film\\, and have a few problems with it.\\n\\nThere are some dangling threads JJ introduced which go largely unresolved or cast aside with a one liner\\, and that is a bit of a disappointment. In particular\\, I wish we'd gotten to see at least one OP Luke scene\\, akin to THAT sequence of Darth Vader from Rogue One. I'm also deeply curious as to what Episode 9 will be about\\, given how conclusive this film felt.\\n\\nBut the thing about Last Jedi is that it's an incredible FILM - the characters are fleshed out for the most part\\, the dialogue is great\\, the effects phenomenal\\, the photography direction impeccable. This is pop art at its finest and I refuse to let plot elements which didn't go the way I would have directed them sour me on what is\\, for the most part\\, a masterpiece. I do think I prefer The Force Awakens\\, but only slightly.","true":true}
