Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Brilliant visuals and some key exciting moments but overall a movie that abuses the long loved franchise characters and throws away many of the previous movies plot points to leave a final episode with no direction or excitement whatsoever. Cringeworthy characters and bad writing result in a fanserving mess filled with out of place scenes and comedy relief worthy of a 5 year old.","true":true}
