Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!! WTF WAS DISNEY THINKING?!?!?! Ryan Johnson had no business directing a Star Wars film. The story was not linear and was extremely choppy. The jokes were not funny and they happened WAY too often. There were so many characters that did not belong\\, for example\\, WHY THE F*** was Benicio Del Toro in Star Wars?!?!? and why the hell did he have a DUMB A** stutter. Whose \\\"brilliant\\\" call was that?! \\n\\nSo many scenes did not make sense\\, there was no follow through. Why did Rey immediately go to the dark side in the first test\\, what was the significance with the  mirror that was under the island that made her see multiple copies of herself?\\, what the F is going to happen now since both Luke and Leia are gone\\, why didn't Luke have a Bad A** role where he was going to train Rey in the ways of the force?\\, Why the F*** did they turn Luke into a PANSY\\n\\nDisney completely BLEW it.......\\n\\nI am happy\\, however\\, that they are bringing JJ Abrams back to direct the last movie\\, after all\\, he did an amazing job on \\\"The Force Awakens\\\"...... Why Disney didn't choose him to direct ALL three films is beyond me......\\n\\n\\nIn conclusion\\, I set the bar very high for this movie and it didn't even come close to meeting my expectations.\\n\\nThe Directing sucked\\nThe Casting sucked\\nThe Acting sucked\\nThe Writing sucked\\n\\n\\nIm sorry JJ Abrams\\, you have a lot of work ahead of you.","true":true}
