Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I made an account just to leave this review. I can accept that this movie was not great\\, but I am completely aghast that reviewers would designate it as the complete opposite.\\n\\nI'm not going to say don't see it\\, cause it's Star Wars and you've got to watch it. But if you find yourself questioning the enthusiasm of those around you\\, know that you aren't alone.","true":true}
