Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":".bad writing again and felt like a different movie altogether than Force Awakens. Also forced political commentary that was not welcomed when qe want to just escape. I was hoping for a good movie and my expectations were... subverted. \\n\\nBeen a long star wars fan and even stomached through the prequels... and if ONLY this was JUST a bad movie but the politics brought into it made it worse why disney do you need to destroy everyhring with politics","true":true}
