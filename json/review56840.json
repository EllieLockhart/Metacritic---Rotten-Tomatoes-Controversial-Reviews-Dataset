Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are some elements to this movie that I really did like.  I appreciated the visuals and I loved the music.  I thought that Daisy Ridley\\, John Boyega\\, Adam Driver and Oscar Issacs all turned in solid perfomances and did the best they could have with the material given.  I liked the battle scenes.  I even liked Benicio Del Toro's small part.  But that is where my admiration for this movie stops.\\n\\nSPOILERS\\nThe list of things I didn't like is almost as long as the things I absolutely hated.  I did not like the humor or the new direction Luke's character went.  I hated the scene when Snoke died.  I hated the new character Rose.  I hated the miniscule part Chewbacca played.  I hated the explanation of Rey's parentage.  I really hated the political and social commentary.\\n\\nThis movie had so much potential.  I really don't know that I'll be as excited about episode 9\\, there is very little left from this movie to look forward to seeing through to completion in the next.  This story seems so far off from the canon that it left wishing it could just be scrapped and redone all together.  Of course that will never happen\\, so for now I am just going to pretend that The Force Awakens was the last Star Wars movie.","true":true}
