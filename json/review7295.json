Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Epic. I see the movies flaws\\, but it just gave me goosebumps and that Star Wars feel right through. Liked it way more than Rogue One and The Force Awakens. Actually\\, I liked it so much that I rate it Top 3. With Episode III still being #1. It had some disputable stuff\\, but it delivered IMO. At least\\, it isn't the 56 % that it currently stands on Audience Score.","true":true}
