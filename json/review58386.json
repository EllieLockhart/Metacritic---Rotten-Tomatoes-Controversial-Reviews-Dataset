Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing it for the 3rd time... I couldn't believe that it got worse each time. I\\, as a majority of the world\\, am a huge star wars fan. This was a bigger disappointment than all 3 prequels combined. \\n\\n1.Canto Bight was a Train wreck used to deepen a useless character. \\n\\n2. The incompetence of the first order as well as the resistance was astonishing. I couldn't believe the mistakes they made. My 8 year old and I we coming up with better military tactics as we sat and watched it.\\n\\n3. They killed off 2 of the strongest characters while building a story to weaken the new villain and protagonist. \\n\\nThat's not all\\, that's just the biggest atrocities. This film doesn't feel like it was made by a fan... it felt like someone who hated star wars... and JJ Abrahms. I have never seen a sequel crap on its predecessor so hard. Good job Rian\\, you may have ruined this trilogy. Literally the only reason I gave this half a star was the throne room fight scene and the FTL battering ram.","true":true}
