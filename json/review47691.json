Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When I first saw The Last Jedi on December 14\\, I was so taken-aback by the film that I gave it 1 star in a review. You see\\, I was 9 years old when Star Wars came out. I immediately identified with Luke Skywalker. The Last Jedi seemed to encroach on everything I loved about the first trilogy.\\n\\nHowever\\, I was wrong. Dead wrong.  Upon a second viewing\\, this movie made so much more sense. It was beautiful and poetic.  Yes\\, even the Leia in Space scene that I had a hard time getting over the first time around was sublime. It was as if I was watching a different movie.\\n\\nThe whole point of the movie is to let go of the past. And if you do\\, you'll love The Last Jedi.\\n\\nAs I sat in the theater the second time\\, I realized that Rey is the Jedi that we all deserve. She was just amazing in this film.  The film was visually stunning\\, especially in the scene on the salt planet. The brief moment when Rey and Kylo work together was gripping. \\n\\nAnd the Yoda scene\\, which I had a hard time accepting the first time around\\, really comes together if you listen to what he has to say.\\n\\nIf you didn't like it because it failed to live up to the expectations of what you think the story should be\\, let it go. That is what the film is asking you to do. And it will blow you away.","true":true}
