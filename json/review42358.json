Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie tried to be too much like Rogue One. If your looking for answers for this one or the last movie. Don't bother\\, because it focuses primarily on the current setting of the movie and barely gives explanations as to whats happened so far\\, or why it's happened. Or how it get here in the first place with all the characters.","true":true}
