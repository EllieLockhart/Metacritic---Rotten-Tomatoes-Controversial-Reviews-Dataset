Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst star wars movie of all time. I felt like walking out\\,  but I just had to see how it was going to end.  Luke just dissapears... It seems Disney is so PG they can't even let a Jedi die\\, he has to disappear for no reason. So many plot holes it's unbelievable. Rose was a pretty lame character. Humor was bad.  Reminded me of a rip off of the Cylon from Battlestar Galactica  who also does maintenance on the ship. She stops Finn from saving everyone... seriously...","true":true}
