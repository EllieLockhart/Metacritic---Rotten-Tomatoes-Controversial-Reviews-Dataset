Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The most recent addition in the Star Wars juggernaut turbulently lives up to its hallowed predecessors by turning the mythos and characters on its head. Rian Johnson has introduced fans to probably the most cinematically appealing of the all instalments and while a few plot points and narrative developments may divide long time fans\\, this film remains stimulating and demanding to the core. Guided along by the brilliant performance of Adam Driver as the conflicted and tortured Kylo Ren as well an entertaining and nostalgic return of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) the film seems to make the most of its characters including the established leads and introduction of fleshed out and interesting support roles. Perhaps the only thorn in the Disney blockbuster is a subjective one. The performance of the narrative alone leaves a lot of questions and very little answers as to the direction of the franchise and the mythos itself. Something which will please some viewers but aggravate many more. Despite this backlash\\, as the dust settles the 8th edition into the hallowed franchise will be regarded should be regarded as one of the best.","true":true}
