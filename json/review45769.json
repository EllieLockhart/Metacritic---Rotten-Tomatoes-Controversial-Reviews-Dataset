Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very lazy writing! Completely went against the spirit of Star Wars. Although the dialogue in the prequels was lacking\\, their story was solid and well thought out. JJ Abrams has a very difficult task of making sense in Episode 9. Rian Johnson basically made the Skywalker line as evil. After 40 years of loving this franchise\\, I doubt I watch another Kathleen Kennedy produced Star Wars.","true":true}
