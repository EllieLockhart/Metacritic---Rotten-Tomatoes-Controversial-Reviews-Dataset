Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I never review movies but I just have to say do not go see this movie. I'm not the biggest star wars fan of them all\\, but growing up with the movies I have to say this is easily the worst of them. I didn't mind TFA\\, it wasn't great but it was ok. This makes Phantom Menace looks like a masterpiece. Only the final quarter of this film on the salt planet even remotely feels like star wars\\, the rest feels like it was trying to be guardians of the galaxy or something with its cheesy one-liners. They made a mockery of the previous movies and especially their characters. It felt like they picked a new director and the description for the job was \\\"must hate star wars and know nothing about how space works\\\"\\n\\nDon't give this movie your money.","true":true}
