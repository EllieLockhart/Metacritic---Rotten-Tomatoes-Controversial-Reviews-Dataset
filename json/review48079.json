Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the flim's narrative beats will certainly be devisive\\, the technical portions are simple and boring. The movie has a lot of fat that should have been trimmed and continually countermanded its own thematic beats with ill timed humor and prequel-level cringe worthy animal side kicks. Overall it was bad.","true":true}
