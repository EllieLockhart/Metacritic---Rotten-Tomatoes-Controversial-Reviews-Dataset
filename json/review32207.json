Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars : an Old Hope\\, Reborn\\n\\n2 years ago I wrote a post\\, complimenting Disney for the excellent job they had done in restoring the much-loved franchise to it's former themes and integrity. I also blasted the fan-boy backlash to 'the Force Awakens' for their despirate attempt to measure Disney's efforts against anything other than their own intentions - when\\, in my opinion\\, Disney and JJ Abrams had done everything they could to restore balance to that galaxy\\, far\\, far away...\\n\\nFast forward 2 years and here we are\\, in the wake of another spectacular offering\\, but with the backlash much less tasteful and the hate much more palpable among those who - again - would seek to try and suggest Disney have done something wrong. However\\, in and amongst the healthy and unhealthy arguments about precisely how good The Last Jedi is\\, I hear an uprising of light to meet this darkness... Like the charge of the Rohirrim mid way through the battle of pelanore fields\\, women\\, men and older children  are standing up and proclaiming\\, with confidence\\, that this new film is the symbol of an old hope\\, Reborn.\\n\\nThe diversity exhibited by the cast of TLJ is a giant leap forward along a path Star Wars has been carefully working it's way back to since Disney acquired Lucasfilm in 2012. For ANY of its other short comings\\, to have women declare that they final feel equally and effectively represented in a large scale Hollywood film is an achievement worth ANY sacrifice made on behalf of fan-boys around the world.\\n\\nFor me\\, the film was a wonderful\\, convulsing mass of the old and the new. I have always loved Star Wars because of its audible moral compass. And that a small but loud section of our society seems to have such a problem with the ethnic and gender diversity\/equality of the film\\, makes me all-the-prouder to love it so much and associate myself as a Star Wars fan.\\n\\nFor the sake of my wife and daughters\\, culture (particularly the film industry) has allot of catching up to do. The Last Jedi has given me back hope - an old hope born when Leia stood up to Vadar - that culture can move in the right direction if good women (and men) do something!","true":true}
