Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A disjointed mess with couple a of great moments and action sequences that should please long time fans. Legacy characters are unrecognizable and pretty much cannon fodder. All of the questions you have been waiting to be answered since \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" are not present. How did Maz get possession of Anakins light saber\\, Who are Reys parents really\\, who are the Knights of Ren\\, why is Rey so powerful as a new force user\\, any background on Snooke in general\\, the origin of the star map to Luke\\,  and the reason of the rise of the first order after the defeat of the empire.  It is honestly just a sequel with a few more splosions and is catered to new audiences with GOTG low brow humor and simplified plot as opposed to doing the legacy justice for long supporters and fans of the franchise. I was not a fan of prequels\\, but George Lucas was brave enough to try and give us new things. This movie is pretty much a mash up of \\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\" and The Return of Jedi\\\" done by monkeys with cameras duct taped to their heads.. It is kind of like a greatest hits album from a band you like with new artwork and one new original track. Mark Hamill deserved better than this and so did the fans. Disney plans on keeping Star Wars safe\\, simple and uninspired to keep the profit chain going.","true":true}
