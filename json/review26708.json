Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok so I see an awful lot of people giving this movie one star and wonder how you were watching the same movie. The movie was amazing and set up a lot of things for the next movie. Oh and space balls is not a Star Wars movie. Still can\u2019t believe someone compared this to that.","true":true}
