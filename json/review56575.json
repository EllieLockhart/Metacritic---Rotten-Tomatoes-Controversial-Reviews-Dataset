Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a movie that seemed built around an idea - perhaps a selfish one - that the current Star Wars IP was to be destroyed so a new version could be created. Whose decision this was? Kathleen Kennedy? It was a very post modern and deconstructionist approach. The director\\, therefore\\, is not to blame entirely\\, he was\\, after all\\, given permission to do so. In doing so\\, all that came before\\, all expectations\\, all the universe\\, the heroism\\, the 'Star Wars' were up on the cutting block.  A movie with such a developed and loved IP succeeds or fails based on how well you meet expectations. Some surprises are of course happily received\\, but they are accepted when encapsulated in the familiar. Well\\, the Force Awakens somewhat achieved this\\, but the Last Jedi did not. The film looks great but the plot lines and character treatments were very disappointing. So many mysteries and character threats were set up in the Force Awakens and totally ignored in the Last Jedi.  But in the end the movie studio will make money and they can now start from scratch and build their own Star Wars and complete their separation from what George Lucas created. Yes\\, the old Star Wars universe was born in a different time\\, but its themes\\, its heroism and wish fulfilment were timeless. It was already a universe with great diversity and imagination. Did it need a reinvention? Was it necessary to deconstruct it? There will be new Star Wars fans created from this\\, but I doubt very much that the new generation of fans will be as impassioned and as in love with this new reinvention as the fans that have been lost.","true":true}
