{"101487":189732,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To preface this review\\, I'm a fan of the movies\\, but never read any of the books in the Extended Universe\\, never played any of the games\\, or watched any of the TV shows. Also\\, I don't read or follow any of the fan theories or speculation.\\n\\nOverall I would rate this movie as \\\"meh\\\". It got off to a slow start and 1 hour in\\, I still didn't feel like the film had really gripped me yet. It started to pick up in the second half as they reached the climactic showdown. \\n\\n[warning: spoilers ahead]\\n\\nThings I liked:\\n- I thought Adam Driver continued to do an exceptional job and really liked his portrayal of Kylo Ren.\\n- Glitzy space battles\\n\\nAreas where the movie fell flat:\\n- Slow start\\n- Major plotholes. If they could lightspeed jump to destroy major ships\\, why didn't they just do that in episodes IV\\, VI\\, and VII? Also\\, why didn't the First Order just jump some ships away and jump them back to attack the Rebels instead of slowly chasing them for 18 hours\\n- Lack of character development. Still have no idea who Snoke is so the climatic showdown with him lacked any substance. Also don't know anything about any of the people in the First Order except Kylo Ren.\\n- Still don't know any backstory of the First Order. That leads to a big disconnect from how episode VI ended and how we got to where we are now. For TFA I forgave them from not establishing that backstory assuming it would be explained in due time\\, but after 2 movies we still don't really know much of anything about the villains which makes the conflict more hollow and lack emotion.","true":true}
