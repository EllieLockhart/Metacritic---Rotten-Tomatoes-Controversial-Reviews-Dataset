Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was exceptionally okay. In other words\\, TLJ had fan-pleasing moments but ultimately squandered it's hyped up payoff in the end. The best way I could put it is this: I would give it 4 or even 5 stars had it been a standalone film. As a star wars film addition\\, the bar was just too high for some of the weak plot points\\, and lack of character development. As Star wars fans\\, we want to care about the new mythos but that is proving to be a challenge with every film in this newest trilogy. ","true":true}
