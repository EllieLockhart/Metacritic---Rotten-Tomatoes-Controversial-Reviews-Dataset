Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Massive wasted potential... feels like an EA-level rushed dlc to the Force Awakens.\\nWhile the first sequel film played it safe\\, and minus a few cracks put up a great fundation for another adventure\\, The Last Jedi doesn't really achieve anything beside creating controversy for the sake of controversy.\\nAn ok riide for the most part with some great moments\\, but someting feels off for most of the times. And when I start to think about it\\, the internal logic fals apart\\, the tone is worse than prequel awkward. Yet when I think further signs of great ideas began tp show\\, that could be amazing with better exdcuting and I'm saddened how bad it fall on it's face the way we got the movie.","true":true}
