Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poor writing made for a poor movie with an amazing cast and production team. Wasted potential. Added nothing to the story and didn\u2019t make me want to see the next one","true":true}
