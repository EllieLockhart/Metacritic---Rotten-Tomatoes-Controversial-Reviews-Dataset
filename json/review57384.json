Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie should not be considered canon. Everything you love about Star Wars\\, the characters\\, the stories\\, the mythology\\, the places\\, the action\\, the tactics\\, the stakes - none of it is here. It was all thrown away in the first scene. I feel sorry for the cast. They were overpaid to play in a movie that has the title Star Wars but really is anything but.\\n\\nWhat you're witnessing is Disney's version. The SJW in charge apparently thinks she can use Star Wars as a vehicle for her trash ideology. The more people she can tell her version of reality to\\, the better.\\n\\nThink of this movie as the manual for how to join antifa\\, how to be a true feminist\\, or better yet\\, how to demonize all white men. Yes\\, I said it. This movie is anti-men and anti-white men in particular.\\n\\nDon't consider this a Star Wars movie.\\n\\nI would give it 2 stars for the acting jobs. Mark Hamill and Adam Driver really did exceptionally well here\\, considering the material. Everyone else does very good jobs\\, probably 4\/5 is the lowest I would give as far as acting. But fantastic acting and a memorable cast can't make up for the terrible writing. It does not answer any questions that were asked in The Force Awakens. The entire movie is a single space battle\\, in which only 4 tie fighters are flown. Mostly it's a bunch of capital ships looking at each other and the reason why they aren't blowing each other up is\\, the audience is told\\, \\\"ah\\, well see... they have 24 hours worth of shielding that nothing can get through.\\\" Give me a break. The Imperial ship chasing them has a city-destroying laser cannon about 10x less powerful than the Death Star\\, and you're telling me the rebel fleet is just going to sit there the entire movie?\\n\\nTalk about suspense. Yawn. No daring escapes. No reason to escape. Why escape when you can just sit there? Yep. Boring as hell.\\n\\nThat's not even to get into the philosophical side of things. Where you go with that in this movie is a completely backwards view from the entire saga up to this point.\\n\\nThere is nothing redeeming about the story\\, whatsoever. What a disservice to Carrie. What a disservice to Mark. What a disservice to Adam. What a disservice to Daisy. What a slap in the face to fans.\\n\\nDisney has never been my favorite company\\, but I will not trust them after this. I'm sure JJA will be able to turn it around and give us a satisfying ep IX\\, but I won't be seeing it in theaters.","true":true}
