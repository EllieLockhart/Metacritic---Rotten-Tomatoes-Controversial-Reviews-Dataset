Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very different from all previous Star War films.....and that's a good thing. Takes the compelling new characters introduced in the previous chapter and puts them through things we haven't seen before in the franchise. Great pacing\\, plot\\, and script\\, with a few laughs thrown in to make it all feel less heavy. Awesome acting from old-comers and new comers alike\\, and wonderful send off for Ms. Fisher.","true":true}
