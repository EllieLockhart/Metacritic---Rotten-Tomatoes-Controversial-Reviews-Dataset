Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily in my top 3 for best Star Wars movies.  Characters were given much-needed depth.  The action was fantastically done.  I had only a couple minor quibbles\\, but they're absolutely drowned out by how good this movie was.\\n\\nDon't listen to the raging butthurt fanboys hating on the movie because it goes against their own fragile vision of what Star Wars should be.  It's good.  It's really\\, really good.","true":true}
