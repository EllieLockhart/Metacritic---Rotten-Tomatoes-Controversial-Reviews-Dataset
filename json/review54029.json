Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't even begin to form an argument on why it sucks so much. I've red the entire extended universe and I know pretty much all there is to know about Star Wars of now and past\\, canon or not and this piece of crap wasn't a Star Wars. It was any space movie ever. Completely denaturizing Star Wars\\, ruining every previous story foundation they built before ep viii. I used to be like a 30yrs old child on the mention of Star Wars and become very excited when talking about it. This died with me entering the movie theater. I went from huge geeky fan to \\\"I can't believe I feel like this but I don't give a fuck about Star Wars anymore\\\".","true":true}
