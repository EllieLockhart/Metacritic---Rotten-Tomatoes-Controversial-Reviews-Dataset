Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*spoilers* \\n Luke Skywalker throwing the lightsaber over his should after Rey hands it to him is exactly what director Rian Johnson did with the Star Wars model.  There were good parts\\, but that bad moments out weighed them.","true":true}
