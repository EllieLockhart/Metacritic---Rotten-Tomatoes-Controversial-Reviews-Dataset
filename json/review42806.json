Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was not a Star Wars movie. Useless story arcs\\, the murdering of the major plotlines from the previous movie. It's almost as if the director and writer didn't know Star Wars or how and why the setting became pipular. Let me put it this way: this movie makes the prequels look good.","true":true}
