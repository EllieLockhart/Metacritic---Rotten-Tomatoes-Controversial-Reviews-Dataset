{"101487":185700,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-26","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie should have been titled : ' how to destroy childhood memories in 10 lessons'. The first 30 minutes were quite normal to watch\\, even if I felt uneasy with some strange plots (the fuckin leiamarypoppinsguardianofthegalaxyorgana scene). At mid movie\\, i sense the disaster coming. the rose 'aka jarjar 2017' and finn arc was a disaster\\, there was nothing to be saved there. the acting\\, the effect\\, the story there (casino royal+any shitty  horse movie)\\, the benicio del toro appearance). Then i realize that they give the key of the starwars universe to a guy who possesse 10% of brett ratners talents (sigh). The reste belong to the history of the worst movie of the cinema\\, nothing works. Nothing. Ryan Johnson just killed Luke skywalker twice in that movie\\, because when luke finally appear\\,after nearly 2h30 long\\, you expected something like the yoda appearance in the clone wars\\, i remember people claps their hands and cheers loudly when that scene came up. But in the last jedi\\, after luke execute a poor chinese cable dodge and reveal himself as the true descendant of Houdini\\, there was not a word in the cinema. Nothing. there come the generic\\, and like a lot of old star wars fan\\, you felt like it was an intellectual rappe. On the following days\\, i watched again the prelogy of georges lucas\\, and it was twice as good than before. I didn't belong to the fans who dislike the prelogy\\, i felt that a movie belongs to his creator\\, and that they should keep their hands free on it. A studio and a poor filmaker like Ryan Johnson are just there to make sort of porn gonzo movie who are resumed in nice trailers and feeded by dythirambic great review. What happend to that score on tomato review ? it seems so unadequated with the peoples thought.... That movie and all his gallery of translucent characters make me sick\\, it has nothing to do with the star wars universe. Rogue one was the proof that you can still do some nice movies about star wars\\, why not giving the key of the following movies to garret edwards??","true":true}
