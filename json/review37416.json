Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The reality Is That for star wars Fan Like Myself Having seen all the movies dating Back to the 1995 Theatrical Movies Before the special editions in 1997 what is amazing to me and this proves Star wars Fans Are not able To Be Pleased This Movie Is fantastic I Loved it and It breaks new ground instead of Just being a retread of Previous films example force awakens which was still great and deserves its 93 on rotten tomatoes by the way \\n\\nThis Film Is Fantastic and without spoliers it is a plot pushing film like empire it asks questions star wars Fans Have Had I Think for Awhile","true":true}
