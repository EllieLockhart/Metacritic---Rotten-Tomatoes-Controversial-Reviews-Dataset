Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where to start with the Last Jedi? \\nIf the movies were a manifestation of light and dark powers trying to lure my spirit in either direction\\, I would have to say that I would be soundly happy ensconced on the fence! The way I see it is\\, the marketing folks have complete control over the content and plot direction the saga will take from now on. I mean\\, I'm sure that we\\, as fans understand that's how this has worked \\, from time and anon. Replacing wookies with ewoks in ROTJ was the beginning of a slippery sarlaac slope! (burp!!!) Only\\, these days the marketeers\/writers\/plot schemers are very cleaver about how they are doing it. Just leaving enough nostalgic content in to draw the original and loyal fans out in their battalionous droves on opening week in the \\\"new hope\\\" of feeling somewhat like we did when we were kids\\, right? Only that's not what really happens anymore. We clutch at tidbits involving original trilogy characters\\, or scenes or even the inclusion of older vehicles\/spaceships that were so magical when we were young\\, that we are temporarily transfixed for a moment\\, and we're there\\, but the moment lapses and we are back in the room coming to terms with the latest installment still frantically hoping to be blown away but in the end we metaphorically shut the door cause the draft is unsettling not threatening.\\n\\nThere are so many issues with Last Jedi\\, what had the potential to deliver on so many levels\\, flatters to deceive on most. These days\\, studios can produce exceptional screen visuals and digital sound\\, so it is no surprise this movie looks great and sounds even better. There are a couple of CGI elements (the puffins & the horses) that are less than convincing. The porgs (puffins) in particular are not well animated and are really pointless and just a waste of time cinematically. No doubt the marketing heads are greasing their pockets as we read! But don't worry about including another annoying CGI misfit.\\n\\n Plot-wise the movie is struggling and overall it seemed too company\\, after all this is the Galaxy Opera\\, the only other movie franchise to change set location more than Star Wars\\, were the Bond Movies of Roger Moore's watch. Getting on\\, it seemed like there was no anchor point in the movie\\, previous installments all had memorable locations as key terrain in the movie collection; in this movie we end up in a deep space standoff of sorts and we get a few minutes here and there in a casino and salt basin backyard. It just doesn't seem expansive enough\\, more like a condensed campbells soup without the varieties. Most of the early scenes are based on the Skellig Islands (Ach-To)\\, I think Hamill does a good job mostly but the narrative is pretty repetitive \\\"join me help me\\, \\\"no\\, i cant\\\"\\, \\\"there is good in him\\, I can feel it\\\"\\, \\\"there is conflict in him etc\\\". All heard numerous times before and all very predictable indeed. *SPOLIER\\nYoda makes an appearance and has completely changed personalities from the prequel movies when he was thoughtful\\, pensive\\, a masterful thinker. Now he is slightly barmy and unhinged ala ROTJ. And for the record the house keepers on Ach-To are another pointless introduction that only serve to dumb down the island story line at times.\\n\\nTo be continued...","true":true}
