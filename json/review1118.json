Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An utter travesty against the legacy of George Lucas and the original trilogy. If it wasn't Star Wars it would have flipped but the massive momentum of the franchise keeps it going. Rose Tico is a fruitless character that ruins Finn's death. Phasma is pointless and Luke is ruined with a few fleeting moments of greatness which turn out to be a mirage. Holdo is a horrible commander and the Heroic Poe is demonized and demoted. As a serious star wars fan I am aghast that the crew behind this work would ignore past Canon and great works to ruin the nahic and hope of the series. Bad form.","true":true}
