Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Incredible character development. Much deeper than the superficially big budget action feel of The Force Awakens. This was a direct contrast to The Force Awakens in the best ways possible. For sure not a rehash of an original trilogy movie\\, like The Force Awakens.","true":true}
