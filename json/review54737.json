Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw the original movies as a young adult. Disney\\, like with the Muppets\\, has ruined the Star Wars Universe.  There was no heart to this movie\\, nor character development\\, nor anything that made you care (except for the portrayal of Finn).  This is NOT the Star Wars Universe I love. This poor movie disrespected all of the original three characters.  Rey's use of the force is absurd.  Rian Johnson trivialized Jedi\\, Sith and everything about the Force. Worst was the disrespect of Luke Skywalker who would never have turned into a sour\\, bitter old man.  Luke Skywalker was the promised Jedi (not Anakin\\, but the son) and the Disney version of Luke destroyed George Lucas's vision and universe.  Disney has killed Star Wars with its greed and buying up of so many franchises\\, trashing most of them.  Disney is a monopoly that should be broken up.  I am heartbroken that they have destroyed Star Wars and the beautiful world(s) Lucas created.  I'll take the prequels over this nonsense\\, garbage\\, poor writing and poor direction of Disney.  Rian Johnson has killed Star Wars and trashed all original ideas.  Carrie Fisher and Leia were also used poorly and was greatly disrepected.  I have to agree her hair style was wretched and I felt the same way as Carrie Fisher did.","true":true}
