Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's not a one star film but it's certainly not a very good film.\\nFirstly I do like Star Wars\\, quite a lot. Enjoyed Rogue One and Force Awakens\\, despite FA borrowing way too much from A New Hope.\\n\\nSPOILERS\\nThe dialogue is terrible in most places. It explains everything in every scene to make sure even the youngest of viewers know what's going on.\\nThe story isn't great\\, the characters make terrible decisions and our protagonist have the most amazing dumb luck at every corner. Don't close the big steal doors until that one ship comes into the base.. Oh lucky it was just Finn. Oh Finn's going to get killed by Phasma\\, nope. Luckily BB8 can do everything.\\nThings just don't make sense\\, Luke left a map (Remember that was the majority of the FA story) so that he could be found should he be needed. Nah\\, turns out he went to the island to die. Luke throwing away\\, in a comical manner\\, a light saber that means so much to him and his family. So funny\\, classic Luke!\\n\\nIt's beautifully shot\\, the final battle is awesome to look at\\, even though I was bored to tears at this point. It's such a shame\\, I wanted to love this but its just not very good.","true":true}
