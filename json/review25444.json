Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No plot and bad story  - diversity within cast used to support a political agenda with no attempt to create a character driven story. Bad attempt a creating a Female \\,99%\\, Fuck Trump\\, Black Lives Matter\\, hippy liberal reboot of battlestar galactica with \\\"laser swords\\\". Ryan Johnson created a movie  without understanding the years of backstory and universe that makes the star wars world special. Its as if he thought he was making a SW spin off not episode 8. Special effects were good but first star wars film that didn't actually have a lightsaber duel AND suggested a Jedi Master (yoda) would use force lighting (Sith ability). The disappointment far exceeded my preconceived expectations of who was Snoke\\, Ray\\, Fin\\, etc - RJ took everything we know about the story and fucked it up - we waited two years for a Highlander 2 - if this is what we are to expect with future films please stop making them - let the fans create their own material as it is far superior to this trash","true":true}
