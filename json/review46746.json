Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well a less enjoyable\\, and not as great sequel to the force awakens. Even though it had memorable parts it still feels like a dud. Fails to capture the magic of this beloved series. ","true":true}
