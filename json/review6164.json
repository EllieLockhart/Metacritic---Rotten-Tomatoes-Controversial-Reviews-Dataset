Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney doesn't care about respecting classic characters that everyone fell in love with\\, like Luke or Han or Admiral Ackbar. They want all the old Star Wars dead ASAP and have thus far made almost no effort to conceal this from the audience. Great characters\\, great emotional opportunities\\, totally wasted by the contempt these people apparently have.\\n\\nWorse still the plot is predictable (once again)\\, cheesy or even stupid at certain points and does anyone honestly like any of these new characters? People will tell me Kylo Ren\\, but he just seems like a sniveling brat to me.\\n\\nI won't be wasting any more money on this garbage though. For me\\, Star Wars died when Lucas sold the franchise. I gave it a chance but it seems to be regressing. It's time to prove to these companies that what they are pushing\\, isn't being well received.","true":true}
