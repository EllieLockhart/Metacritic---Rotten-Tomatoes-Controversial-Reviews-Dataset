Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sooo soo many dissappointments... A mighty map to the last Jedi to be used when needed\\, only to have him toss his saber and interest in the first few seconds. Too much nipple juice clearly dwindling the mind.\\nWho is Snoke?  Wtf  Rose?! Leia flying in space?! Where were the epic light saber fights?! I don't have the heart to go on...\\nTotal 'meh' film.","true":true}
