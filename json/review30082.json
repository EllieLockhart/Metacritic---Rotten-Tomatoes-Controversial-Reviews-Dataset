Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sad and dissapointed. Made by people with no love of star wars and it's legacy. \\\"How can we kill off all the characters the fanboys have come to love in 2 movies?\\\".  This movie sadly\\, fits right at home with I\\, III and III. Amateurs with too much money\\, love of effects and hatred of mystery and suspence.  The heros weren't really scared..and joked around like clowns...  The villains belonged in a Laurel and Hardy routine at times...  what a wasted opportunity.  I enjoyed wathcing the effects...and the roller coaster...Like it's entertaining watching your own house go down in flames with great pyrotechnics...yes it's fun\\, but leaves a really bad taste in the mouth.","true":true}
