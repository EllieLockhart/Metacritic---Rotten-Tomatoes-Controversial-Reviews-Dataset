Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a crap sandwich.  Useless scenes and characters\\, bad attempt at humor\\, and terrible portrayal of Luke. \\n\\nBUT what ticks me off the most was the PC agenda here.  I'm great with diversity\\, but this is so blatant it is pandering.  Rose and Fin let the racing animals go but leave the slave children because animal rights.  All the women have all the answers.  And then there is the not so subtle lecture on capitalism and wealth.  Disney\\, you take take your agenda and shove it up your ass.  I don't care about your views on these things\\, I just want to be entertained at the movies.","true":true}
