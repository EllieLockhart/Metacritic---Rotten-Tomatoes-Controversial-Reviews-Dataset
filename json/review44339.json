Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many plotholes in the movie\\, too many unanswered and unsatisfying answers to what started off as an awesome Star Wars Trilogy film. Disappointing. This is why you should never have two different directors directing a trilogy.","true":true}
