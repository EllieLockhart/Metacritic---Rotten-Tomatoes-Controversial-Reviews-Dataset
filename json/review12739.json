Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I created an account just to warn other fans about this abomination of a movie. As you know by now Luke Skywalker dies i the movie.But\\, he isn't killed off. He is assassinated by Rian Johnson. Everything Star Wars seems to be some kind of a joke to him and who ever else wrote this piece of garbage. Everything that captivated fans about any of the previous movies was made into some kind of joke. From Luke turning into an old crotchety coward who has lost his faith in the Jedi to Leia Poppins magical flight through space. I would rather see a Jar Jar Binks origin story if it were written by Lucas. At Least I could believe that I was seeing a SW film. And lets not forget that you will have 2 1\/2 hours of political drivel that will be shoveled down or throat. Two years of anticipation and this is what we're handed: a turd. This was not a Star Wars movie. It was a politically correct message that must have been funded by the DNC. Enough said.","true":true}
