Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful. Kills a lot of the story built up by episode 7\\, a lot of \\\"gotcha\\\" moments to try and surprise you but just disappoint and annoy you. It is blatantly attempting to rip off the empire strikes back\\, but does so poorly in every aspect including a 1+ hour long \\\"chase\\\" scene going at 2mph\\, a new cloud city with child labor and bad rich people\\, a new Hoth with salt instead of snow with the same but far inferior walker battle\\, so many points where you think a character is going to die but just kidding no one important dies! I could talk about it for days\\, but this is a movie you watch once then immediately hate and swear to never to watch it start to finish ever again.","true":true}
