The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I went into this game with no spoilers at all expecting an amazing game just like the first\\, and while the graphics are amazing\\, the game is a chore to play. Now time for the story.  The first hour or so was pretty good\\, I personally liked the guitar scene and other scenes like that\\, but then comes Abby. At first I already was not very interested in playing as her because I wanted to play Ellie the hole way through. Here comes my first problem with the story\\, Tommy and Joel help a stranger\\, and that\u2019s fine because yeah they might have become nicer over the time skip but they would not give out their names at all. Then skip some fluff and Joel dies a very gruesome and unnecessary death due to him and Tommy saying their names. His death was coming\\, I knew that\\, but so soon and so unlikely? No\\, not the Joel that I and thousands of other actual fans know would let himself get surround by a shack full of strangers. Then after some gameplay as both Abby and Ellie I decided that I was committed to getting revenge for Joel as Ellie\\, so I ignored most of Abbie\u2019s story and focused on Ellie\u2019s due to Abby\u2019s just not capturing me. But as I was playing as Abby going through the standard level\\, I noticed that an enemy I killed looked familiar. You kill Tommy as if he was a standard NPC\\, a major character gets killed by a single shot to the head and it is done. I hated this so much. At this point I was burnt out by the game and was just pulling through to get revenge for Joel. So I reach the end finally\\, take down Abby and wait for my chance to kill or maybe even have Ellie say something like\\, \u201cYou don\u2019t get to rush this\u201d as you get your revenge.BUT NOPE\\, the entire end goal\\, the entire thing that made me push through this garbage doesn\u2019t exist. You don\u2019t avenge Joel\\, you instead let the killer of one of the most beloved characters in history\\, GET AWAY.2\/10 Looked nice but gameplay is mediocre at best and story sucks\\, would not buy\\, and would just forget it ever happened\u2026 Expand","true":true}
