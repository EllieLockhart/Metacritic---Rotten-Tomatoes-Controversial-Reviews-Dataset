Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson made a politically correct Disney movie that manages to squander any sense of tension and emotion with silly comedic gags that literally left the crowd scratching their heads. Why? Why would you inject silly humor and obligatory scenes into tense action scenes. Some of the characters\\, like Rose\\, literally had zero impact on the narrative and only succeeded in making some pathetic political points. Get Rian off any Star Wars project moving forward. I'm glad JJ is helming the next film. They should have made this a Disney cartoon. It sure felt like one. This will be the first time I see a Star Wars film once. Garbage.","true":true}
