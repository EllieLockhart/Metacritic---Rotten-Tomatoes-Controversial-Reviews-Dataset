Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The returning characters are great\\, but the new additions leave much to be desired. A lot of plot points should be easy to solve\\, but we gotta have movie! Which results in incredibly stupid scenarios that could be solved with a single sentence.","true":true}
