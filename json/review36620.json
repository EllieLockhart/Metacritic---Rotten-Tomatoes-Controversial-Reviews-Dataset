Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the movie is a mess. nothing makes sense in this movie. casino planet? luke issues a clone thing to just die anyway? so many characters were used to fit a story. nothing in this movie made sense or felt organic.","true":true}
