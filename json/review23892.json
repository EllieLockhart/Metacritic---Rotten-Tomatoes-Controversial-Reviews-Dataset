Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Make a mistake once and thats forgivable. Make the same mistake twice and well\\, maybe you just needed to really learn that lesson properly. Do it a third time and you re an idiot. The forced awakens should have been a lesson to everybody that star wars was dead\\, the magic had gone out of the universe and you ll never recapture lightning in a bottle. This latest turd is a pure insult to the originals. Mark Hamill should be suing for defamation of fictional character. Anybody going to see the third installment should be publicly mocked.  Some people sadly just won  t learn their lessons. Disney will be preparing the next row of arses to shaft no doubt. The world will continue as normal\\, it will just have an extra layer of pond scum floating on it. Such is Hollywood movie making these days. Folks star wars was done in the 80 s. Move on.","true":true}
