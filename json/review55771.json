Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot wise the film was focused on Ray\\, but to prevent sidelining other characters\\, a subpar side plot was created.\\na few uninspiring new characters (The General & the codebreaker)\\nExcessive run time\\nNot a bad film\\, but deff one of the weaker Star Wars","true":true}
