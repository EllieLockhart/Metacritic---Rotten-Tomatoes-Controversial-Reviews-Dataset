Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is the worst film in the history of the Star Wars franchise!\\nNow before you bring out the pitchforks and start endless debates about the quality of the Prequels\\, let me explain that there is still plenty to love about TLJ. But there are so many problems with this entry of the franchise that it takes away from any enjoyment you'll get!\\n\\nFirstly\\, the character arcs in the film were seriously underdeveloped. Finn has gone from being one of the lead characters in the Force Awakens to being relegated to an eventual mealiness side plot. The only real highlight for the character is his boss battle with Captain Phasma...but even that feels empty somehow!\\nThere is also a scene in the final act of the Movie involving Fin that would have been amazing but instead is ruined in a cheap attempt at sentiment.\\n  \\nPoe's story arc is especially frustrating and it makes the Resistance look even more useless than the Rebellion in Rogue One!\\n\\nBut the biggest problems lie in Lucasfilm's decision to either ignore the questions we all had after we watched TFA or give us such sad\\, stupid\\, anti-climatic answers that take away all the magic.\\n\\nThe so-called \\\"plot twists\\\" (that you can see coming from a mile away) are neither shocking or satisfying for the audience. And as I left the cinema\\, I could hear my fellow moviegoers saying statements like \\\"What a massive letdown\\\" and \\\"What's happened to Star Wars\\\".\\nAnd don't get me started on how much of a whinging crybaby Kylo Ren is and how naive and silly Rey looks a lot of the time.\\n\\nBut\\, with all that being said...the movie does have some redeeming qualities. The humour in the film was a highlight\\, and I caught myself chuckling more than once. And the action sequences will get your blood pumping.\\nBut the two best moments of the film involve the last remaining Skywalkers...Luke and Leia! Both have epic\\, bad ass Force-wielding moments that will leave you saying \\\"Holy S**t\\\" and will eventually have you shedding a tear.\\n\\nIf I had to point the finger of blame at someone for how TLJ turned out\\, I would pick the man who wrote and directed the film...Rian Johnson! I mean\\, it's clear he has a deep love for the franchise\\, but his style of filmmaking\\, and the themes he likes to explore just don't fit. If you look at one of his previous films Looper\\, you can see he likes to explore the idea of how the choices we make can affect the our futures in ways we can't foresee. But that kind of plot point would only work in the world of Star Wars in VERY small doses. Simply put Rian Johnson deviates too far from the Star Wars movie formula!\\n\\nI'm happy J.J. Abrams is returning to write and direct Episode IX and hope he will put the franchise back on track. Unfortunately\\, Johnson is tapped to write and direct Episodes X\\, XI and XII...Argh!\\n\\nI know a lot of you will take issue with what I've said in this review. But I would really suggest you consider my points with multiple viewings of TLJ because I'm confident if you do\\, you'll see what I'm trying \\nP.S. Porgs suck!!!","true":true}
