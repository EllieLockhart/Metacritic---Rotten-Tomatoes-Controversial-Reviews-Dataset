Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a bit too hokey at times.  At one point Luke winks at C3PO and dusts off his shoulders after they aren't able to blow him up.  Otherwise it is pretty good but only worth 3 stars.  Definitely not as good as the last JJ Abrams film.","true":true}
