Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While agree that this movie is VERY different from star wars of the past\\, that doesn't detract from its place in the star wars universe. It struggles in the middle with the Canto Bight plot-line\\, but otherwise the story does well to show the frantic escape of the Rebels and the desperation that comes with failure. Luke is true to character despite what others say. The best thing he's done in life was redeem his father and destroy the empire\\, and that made him hopeful. Time passes and everything he fought for betrays him in front of his eyes. Of course he's a cynical recluse now. nothing he did mattered to him anymore\\, the dark side still prevailed. Daisy Ridley is fanstastic as always. Rian Johnson made bold choices and I appreciated the direction he went.","true":true}
