Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm just a viewer\\, not a SW \\\"fan\\\". However it was disappointing and the SW trilogy recycled\\, again. The audience gotcha misdirection\\, simply made you think\\, why did you bother going down that route in the first place? Who was the \\\"mysterious\\\" Emperor knockoff Smoke? Who cares. What was the point copying the Emperor then having him dispatched but one film early this time? None but to wrong foot the audience. Similarly the \\\"mystery\\\" over Super Rey's parentage dissolved into an \\\"anyone can be special\\\" didacticism. I don't really care which (force) orientation Ren plumbs for in the finale. Either way it won't be a surprise. He's no Darth Vader. What has the point been of making his entire character\\, what was one small part of Vaders- his conflict from ROTJ? I'd rather he were just plain evil. Maz thingy\\, Phasma and the Leia temporary replacement\\, all wasted. Why bypass Leia for half the film?  A plot device to delay the reveal of her escape plan.  And that casino planet stuff was straight out of the prequels.  Mark Hamill said he fundamentally disagreed with what they did with Luke.  The irony is the Director appeared to not like TFA's cut and paste approach. But the approach just served to undermine it. Unsurprising there is so much divided opinion.","true":true}
