Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Utter trash!!!\\n\\nPlot holes galore.   Senseless character motivations.  Luke Skywalker absolutely shitted on. The original trilogy rectally savaged for nostalgia nods in a way that gave me space chlamydia.\\n\\nAnd OMG MaRey Sue:  a protagonist that no one can connect with\\, because she has no arc.  For a story that focuses on THE Jedi (Luke Skywalker) being taught about mistakes etc and what it teaches oneself\\, maRey sue has no flaws\\, makes no mistakes in judgement\\, is proficient in everything she does with no training.  She takes the proficiency high-ground in every fight\\, and has the moral high-ground in every emotional \/ spiritual conflict.  She even has a few things to teach THE Jedi Master (Luke Skywalker) about hope and fighting for your friends... because we all know from the original trilogy Luke was missing those qualities....\\n\\nI guess Kathleen Kennedy was real pissed at George Lucas about those \\\"white slavers\\\" comment and decided to just destroy the Star Wars franchise for good.  Well done Kate\\, I won't be watching anymore Star Wars(TM) movies.","true":true}
