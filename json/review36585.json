Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie has its problems\\, but nothing to the degree people have said. Hating it because it\u0092s not how they would have done it. I really enjoyed it and liked what they did with the characters","true":true}
