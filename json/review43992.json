Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thrilling\\, intense\\, emotional\\,and funny. These are only a few of the words I can think of to describe this movie. This is truly a masterpiece\\, and Rian Johnson hit it out of the park and to the moon with this one. I went into the movie theatre with extremely high expectations\\, and the movie surpassed them and then some! Much better than the nonensical Force Awakens. An excellent movie indead\\, and possibly one of the best Star Wars movies of all time\\, if not the best.","true":true}
