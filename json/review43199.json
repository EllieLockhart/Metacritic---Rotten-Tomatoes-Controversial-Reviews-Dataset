Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This Star Wars feels like it was written and directed by a focus group. Having grown up and loved the original trilogy (when they were re-released)\\, it's pretty clear that the new Star Wars is here as a marketing vehicle more than a story. While they try to recycle elements from the original trilogy to appeal to Star Wars geeks like myself\\, it's pretty clear from ads with 6-year-olds I see everywhere that they're more concerned with capturing the loyalties of the next generation of movie goers. It's just become a money making machine\\, and not platform to create films that push the boundary of storytelling. The brand will probably be able to make a billions more just continuing to churn out focus-group written movies\\, but it's really sad to see the story and idea fall apart because of money. Basically\\, Star Wars is now on the dark side.\\n\\nIf for some reason a suggestion might land with whoever's might have some influence over Star Wars' future\\, this is what I suggest: Find a new hope. One person who has the inner passion\\, intrinsic drive\\, and cohesive creativity to make an impeccable\\, well-crafted story. Forget about the effects\\, the focus groups\\, the old Star Wars fans\\, the new Star Wars fans\\, and just make something that pushes ahead.","true":true}
