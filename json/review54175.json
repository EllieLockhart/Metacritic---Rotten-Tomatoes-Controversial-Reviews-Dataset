Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I find the stellar reviews from critics baffling. The film lacks the most important quality of star wars - imagination. Star wars is a franchise that transcends divides - generational\\, political\\, gender etc. We marvel in the nativity and wonder of this galaxy - in this black and white world - as a form of escapism. Johnson succeeded in obliterating that magic; Planet Monaco and its weapon dealing oligarchs with super cars? Star wars is meant to hark to the familiar\\, not replicate it - bloody hell.\\n If Johnson was so bent on grounding star wars to the real world he should have offered a substantial plot twist that released the franchise from its biggest philosophical short coming - its black and white morality. I think it crossed his mind\\, but then he didn't have the balls to go through with it.Shame because this Beautifully made film could have been the beginning of a really interesting evolution for the franchise.\\n Shame the efforts and talents of so many people who made this film happen both on screen and behind the scenes are let down\/","true":true}
