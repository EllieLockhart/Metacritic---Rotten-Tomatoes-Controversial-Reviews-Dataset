Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love this movie. The new additions Ioved like force projections and bridges between mind. I can't believe I'm  typing this but this is better than Empire Strikes Back and that's saying something cause Empire Strikes Back is the best and you really have to try hard to get even close to Empire Strikes Back. The only problem I have with this is that Snoke went out like a b*th.","true":true}
