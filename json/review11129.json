Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hmm....This is a fairly tough review to write. Though I gave it four stars because I feel like it missed the mark in several places. HOWEVER\\, what I can say is\\, I think everyone is overreacting to what was in the movie. My creative\/writing instinct says that there's something buried a bit deeper within the dialogue that's part of a deeper\\, Trilogy length plot that they've cleverly disguised.\\n\\nIf you haven't noticed the previous movie was called The Force Awakens. So I can argue right now that the trilogy as a whole is trying to tell a story more Force-Centric. Honestly though? While I can debate the part about the direction they took Luke Skywalker\\, as it wasn't great\\, or perhaps well-executed at the least. But\\, it was a decent story.\\n\\nAs for Snoke\\, I figured he was just a stepping stone character or a throwaway character. I really didn't expect too much from him anyhow as he was nothing compared to Emperor Palpatine. But I see the significance of him plot-wise for Kylo\/Ben's character arc.\\n\\nI do recommend you see it and in addition\\, that you also reserve any final judgement until you see IX.","true":true}
