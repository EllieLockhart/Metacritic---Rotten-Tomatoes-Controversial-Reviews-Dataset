Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Never have I guessed what was going to happen next and been wrong so many times in a movie. I was pissed they didn't have 9 playing right after this one! Another 2 years I can't make it that far! Best since Empire for sure.","true":true}
