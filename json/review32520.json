Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi attempts to redefine Star Wars by trying to make the film appear deeper and intellectual. However it is in this attempt that Star Wars miserably fails. \\n\\nStar Wars the Last Jedi kills every interesting idea set up in The Force Awakens \\n\\nA film ruined by too much ambition.","true":true}
