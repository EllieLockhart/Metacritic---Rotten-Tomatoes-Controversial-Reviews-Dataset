Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie had an immediate let down moment.  The dramatic entrance of Luke Skywalker as he carelessly and casually tosses aside the light saber given to him. From them on he appears selfish and crass.  What a let down.  Movie is filled with pointless\\, silly one liners the devalue the characters.","true":true}
