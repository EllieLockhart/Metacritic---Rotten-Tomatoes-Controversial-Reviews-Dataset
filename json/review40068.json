Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is no doubt one of the most ambitious Star Wars movies ever made. Director Rian Johnson definitely did not play it safe when creating this visually dazzling and invigorating film. There are plenty of plot twists which are unpredictable. Although many of these twists may be negatively viewed by audiences today\\, in the future we will learn to appreciate them. Also\\, performances from individuals such as Mark Hamill\\, Daisy Ridley\\, and others truly stood out. Sure\\, the film wasn't perfect\\, especially through some of the abandoned plot points and logical fallacies\\, but overall\\, this is a solid addition to the Star Wars saga.","true":true}
