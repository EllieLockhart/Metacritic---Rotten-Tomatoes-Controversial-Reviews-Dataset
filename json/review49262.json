Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie of all time. Filled with unnecessary side stories that bring no value to character arcs. Everything in the movie was a joke\\, literally\\, so all anticipation was removed... there wasn't a single 'ah-hah or damn that was badass\\\" scene in the entire movie. I found myself saying \\\"oh you gotta be kidding me\\\" more than anything else. Idk what else to say other than I'm disappointed. I don't think this is recoverable. None of the original cast is alive anymore outside of chewy.","true":true}
