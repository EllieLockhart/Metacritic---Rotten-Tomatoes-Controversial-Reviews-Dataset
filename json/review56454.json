Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the director said that when you watch the movie you will go home after and you will want to get out your old star wars toys all i felt leaving the cinema after i had watched it was sad.\\ni felt sad and empty i only hope that this movie was just a mind fuck to set us up for the episode 9 or else im done with their bad movies cause i dont want disney and their directors ruining my childhood memories of something epic!!!AND BTW I NEED MORE OBI WAN KENOBI","true":true}
