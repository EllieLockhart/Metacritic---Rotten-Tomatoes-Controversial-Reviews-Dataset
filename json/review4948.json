Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Could have a Star Wars movie gone worst than the Last Jedi? I don't think so. Plot holes everywhere\\, even impossible facts for being Star Wars are tremendously pathetic (See 'Mary Poppins in outer space' or 'The lion that starved to death because nyus were too cute'). Boring characters\\, zero respect for the original saga and extremely long. Seems that quality doesn't matter anymore\\, just do as much money as possible by going faster than the lightning releasing movies and introducing cute little creatures to sell them as toys; or even buying the critics to give them more box office. It is understandable tha kids and some people might like it\\, but someone with small knowledge in cinema can clearly distinguish that this movies is just awful. The half star is for the visual effects.","true":true}
