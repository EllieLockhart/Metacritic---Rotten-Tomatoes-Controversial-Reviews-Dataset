Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was 11 years old when Episode iV came out so feel able to have a seasoned and objective view on the films.  Episode VIII had only 2 flaws - the scene with Leia in space was poorly conceived and even worse executed\\, plus the scene on Canto Bight was way too long - but I suspect important hooks are being created here for Episode IX.  My overall opinion is that this is right up there with the best of the original trilogy but a view more viewings and a bit of time will be needed to put Episodes Iv\\, V and VIII in their correct order - Star Wars truly returned after 3 decades with The Force Awakens and took another step forward with The Last Jedi.  Anyone who doesn't think Luke left as a hero really doesn't understand the nature of true heroics.","true":true}
