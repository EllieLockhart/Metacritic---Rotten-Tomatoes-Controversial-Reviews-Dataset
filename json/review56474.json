Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film introduces different concepts and comes so close to taking risks that truly make a major impact on the saga\\, yet it is too concerned with playing it safe. The pacing is all over the place which makes it feel too long and causes watch checking.","true":true}
