Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thoroughly enjoy a ball. How refreshing to get an original storyline in Star Wars. Plenty of action and lots of unexpected twists. Yes\\, one or two things I thought were a little silly\\, but it would be a spoiler to get into it. Overall this was much more enjoyable  then I expected. I see myself buying the DVD eventually. Obviously someone is trolling the negative comments.","true":true}
