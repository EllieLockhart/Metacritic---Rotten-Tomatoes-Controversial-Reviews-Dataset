Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mickey Mouse has finally done it. Took him 3 attempts\\, but he's ruined Star Wars. A watchable movie\\, but the worst of Star Wars thus far\\, including the much maligned prequels.","true":true}
