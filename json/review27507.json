Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall I enjoyed the movie it has some flaws but still worth seeing. It did kind of have a Marvel movie vibe to it. Def a good movie to bring kids to very Fam friendly but older fans may be let down by some character arcs. Bottom line if you\u2019re a Star Wars fan you should definitely see it and give this movie a chance.","true":true}
