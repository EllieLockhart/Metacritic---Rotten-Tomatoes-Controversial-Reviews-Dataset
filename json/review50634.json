Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"4.5 out of 5..\\nA little long it could use 10 minutes of cuts..\\nThe sound blew my head off in IMAX..\\nI will see it again in IMAX in about 3 weeks..\\nThe film challenges some Star Wars axioms so it takes some viewers out of their comfort zone..\\nNo spoilers from me..","true":true}
