Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were a lot of legitimately good scenes in this movie... but ultimately it was let down by bad directing. Too much time was spent on side stories\\,  action sequences\\, and gratuitous cutesy animal scenes instead of focusing on the core story. A number of plot points were contrived and character growth \\\"lessons\\\" were ham handed. If the movie could just go through one last editing pass\\, have it's core story tightened and fluff removed\\, it would be fantastic. As it is\\, the cringe and meandering outweighs the good.","true":true}
