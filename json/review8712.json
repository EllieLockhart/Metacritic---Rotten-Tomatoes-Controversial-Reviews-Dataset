Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Flying Space Leia?\\nMagical Duplicate Luke?\\nMystical Hall of Mirrors?\\nHan to Rian: THAT'S NOT HOW THE FORCE WORKS!\\n\\nI felt JJ & especially Edwards really captured the feel of the original Star Wars.  They respected it and understood it.  The creators of this movie did not.  Many scenes felt like they were derived from the prequels and some seemed more a homage to HARRY POTTER than Star Wars.\\n\\nWith respect to the script\\, Disney you have billion trillion dollars\\, PLEASE\\, PLEASE\\, pay a just few thousand for someone skilled in literature to review it.  The dialogue\\, the plot\\, the misplaced jokes... even the title crawl was not written well. Why did it turn out this way?\\n\\nI love Star Wars and I am only posting this in the hope that things will not continue to follow this trajectory.  I'm still convinced Episode 9 will recover to be the movie Star Wars deserves\\n\\nPS How about giving CHRISTOPHER NOLAN a shot?  That would be epic.","true":true}
