Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie 's characters and situations were too illogical. My suspension of disbelief failed to kick in due to this. The pacing was off and uneven. Some scenes did not add to the story and should have been taken out or replaced with other scenes. Some of the characters felt under-utilized or poorly written. The actress playing Rose had subpar acting and was the wrong choice for the role. Luke was not like Luke from previous iterations. If the story is going to dramatically change the character of Luke\\, it is the story's responsibility to illustrate to the viewer how and why this occurred. Ultimately\\, it did not feel like Star Wars.","true":true}
