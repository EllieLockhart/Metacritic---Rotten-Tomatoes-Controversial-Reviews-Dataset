{"101487":171235,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-28","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Summary:\\n-Poorly written\\n-Excellent CGI\\n-Terrible Romance\\n-Tremendous Potential\\n-Star Wars\\n\\nThis sounds like the prequels... but it's not. And it's incredibly depressing.\\n\\n---Spoilers---\\n\\nHere's what I took away from this: (- negative\\, + positive)\\n\\n-Opening credits say exactly what happened in the last movie... and then doesn't start where the last movie left off. Instead we get:\\n-Bad use of humor in a tense situation which does not make sense either character wise\\, and fails as a joke. Just awkward dialog to 'buy time' for the rebels. If the general noticed a tiny little ship like that\\, he'd just ignore it\\, fire at the planet\\, and use those turbolasers\\, after all\\, Poe himself says in The Force Awakens \\\"Alright\\, we've gotta take out as many of these cannons as we can or else we aren't going to get very far.\\\" and when that didn't work because he's an awesome pilot\\, they just shot at him with missiles. Once the general notices that they sent their ace pilot practically unguarded\\, he'd fire from the other ships adjacent and obliterate Poe. It's retarded in every way.\\n-Leia doesn't like the plan and Poe apparently came up with it. Why would he destroy the cannons if the original plan did not include bombing them? How'd they get those slow bombers there so fast when you see later that the ships can just nail transport ships that are really far away.\\n-Gravity doesn't work like that once you get that far away from planets. Bombs do not fall\\, they have to be guided.\\n-They arm their bombs while being extremely close together\\, extremely slow\\, and with 5x the amount of bombs that they needed.\\n-If they did indeed arm all of those bombs and then get blown up\\, the explosion would look more like the Halifax Explosion in 1917 and wipe out virtually all of the attacking force.\\n-Why do the bombers not have shields? Especially to protect pilots from dying. Why can't pilots drop bombs from the cockpit IF IT'S A REMOTE BUTTON?!? Why not use those extra people as gunners? Why aren't they all sucked out into space the moment that the bomb doors open? Why are the bombers on fire if they're in space? What sort of fuel is on the surface of the bombers to create those fires?\\n-So Rose's sister dies in the process and somehow is the only one left. All the other bombers blew up and her co-pilot\/bomber buddy died.\\n-The other imperial ships just sat there and watched the ship be destroyed. Again\\, later in the film just one ship is able to pick off transport ships from an incredible distance.\\n-Poe talking to the ship shouldn't have affected the ability of the destroyer ship to fire at the ground the moment that it arrived. Higher decisions are made like that\\, but its job is literally to do that.\\n+Visually it was awesome to see Poe show how he's an awesome pilot... but we already know that.\\n---\\nFirst few minutes and there's already plot holes and bad writing. Even if Poe had just stayed on the main ship\\, nothing would have changed except no one would be dead... yet. Immediately after\\, the cannons would have blown them up so is Leia the idiot now? Who's really the hot head?\\n---\\nCut to Luke and Rei\\n---\\n-Extended pause of him holding the saber and looking at it\\, only to throw it over his shoulder. I laughed because of how stupid the director was for doing that. Stretching out something like that for a punchline joke is stupid and not funny.\\n-Awkward dialog didn't make any sense. The best part was the \\\"No one's from nowhere\\\" \\\"Jaku\\\" \\\"Okay\\, that's pretty much nowhere.\\\"\\n+Mark doing a great performance as 'Luke'\\n-Nothing happens still and Luke asks about Leia\\n---\\nCounter attack\\n---\\n-Fin wakes up and lost a few brain cells because he's acting like and idiot and it will continue for the rest of the movie.\\n-Leia says to Poe \\\"Bad boy! Bad!\\\" and then enemy ships start to come at them and she says \\\"Sick him! Good boy!\\\"\\n-Somehow\\, just like the bombers suddenly being super close to the destroyer\\, all of these Tie Fighters are suddenly super close to the ship and blow up the shipyard\/bay.\\n-Emotional moment is wasted because Kylo doesn't decide to kill his mother\\, but his pilot buddies do (despite him not telling them to) and Leia still doesn't die.\\n-Leia doesn't die. Either save her with a force bubble\\, or don't save her with a force bubble\\, but don't wait 10 seconds for her to superman herself back to the ship and open the door which would have killed everyone in that hallway including Poe.\\n+Leia superman-ing back to the ship made me laugh out loud.\\n-Leia is in a coma\\n-Admiral akbar is also killed with only a small mention of it.\\n-Replaced by \\\"I have something to prove and I'm jealous of how close you were with Leia. In fact\\, I blame you for everything bad\\\" lady who doesn't tell anyone anything which drops morale faster than this movie drops previous plot points.\\n-She gives everyone every reason to betray her. When she doesn't trust them\\, they don't trust her. Terrible 'admiral' who appears to have never led anyone before.\\n-Fin tries to escape to find Rei because.... reasons? It would not serve any purpose. And how would he find her anyways?\\n-We meet Rose who is crying because her sister just died and then is happy because she meets her hero who appears to be running for his life\\, along with a lot of other people who apparently tried to do just that.\\n+Poe starts to take charge and figure out a way to get a win out of this no-win scenario.\\n-New admiral lets everyone on the support ships die. They could have diverted and gone to hyperspace in opposite directions\\, at least saving half of the fleet.\\n---\\nLuke and Rei\\n---\\n-Kylo became Kylo because Luke decided to kill him after he saw SOME darkness in his best friend and twin sister's son. But Luke also went on a suicide mission to turn the second most evil person to the light side because he thought that he still had good in him.\\n+Kylo and Rei back and forth was really well done.\\n+Some moments were actually funny. The laser blast in the house that the alien nuns fixed\\, and as she is practicing\\, knocks down some rock which smashes a wheelbarrow that the alien nuns were pushing.\\n+Nice development from both characters (as we know them in this movie)\\n-Untrained Rei somehow overpowers Luke with sticks and then threatens him with a lightsaber.\\n-Luke says he came there to die which breaks every previous movie. Luke isn't so self-serving and narcissistic that he'd leave a map so that people could bury him.\\n-Luke goes to burn the tree\\, changes his mind\\, and then yoda blasts it with lightning. Why? Rei either has the books already\\, read them\\, or she literally does not need them so the entire scene was pointless.\\n+R2 uses the original \\\"Help me obiwan kenobi\\\" to get Luke to come help.\\n---\\nPoe and Rose\\n---\\n-Everything about this is garbage and useless. There was no need for the screen time\\, let alone the plot point. The character betraying them doesn't even matter because you can see the little transport ships from Snoke's room. WHY WHY WHY. Their fight with Phasma later doesn't make any sense\\, and has continuity errors almost every 5 minutes.\\n+I laughed hard at the scene with the ironing of the clothes. At this point I stopped caring about the movie emotionally.\\n---\\nBack on the rebel ship\\n---\\n-Everyone is dying and Poe attempts to take over the ship\\, which he does successfully for about 1 minute with Leia FORCE PUSHING THE DOOR OPEN.\\n-The part of the ship that he is in was previously blown up\\, wasn't it?\\n-The vice admiral says \\\"I like that kid\\\" WHAT?!\\n-Everyone gets on transports and more than half of them die before the vice admiral rams them.\\n+Great visuals\\n---\\nBack in snokes room\\n---\\n+Kylo tricks Snoke with a classic distraction and kills him.... but\\n-Snoke is so powerful and in tune with the force that he should have been able to feel Kylo manipulating the light saber next to him.\\n-Kylo fights worse than he did in the last movie after he was shot\\, and slashed on the arm with a saber.\\n+Overall the fight was very cool\\n-The constant switching of plot points made it difficult to keep the concentration.\\n-\\\"We should forget the jedi and the sith and create a new order by killing all of your friends.\\\" Rei is like ummmmm\\, FORCE PULL and Kylo is like FORCE PULL and the saber goes BOOM and the ship is hit with the other ship and the girl (Rei) without armour ends up waking up first and getting the heck out of there.\\n---\\n-Fin and Rose are taken into the hangar to be executed\\, but with a laser axe? I laughed.\\n-Fin and Rose appear 100 feet away from all the other storm troopers after the ships hits. I laughed.\\n-Phasma gets hit once and falls into an fire pit. I laughed. First the trash compactor and now the incinerator?\\n-BB8 is a murderer.\\n-Fin and Rose don't die a heroic death.\\n---\\n-Everyone somehow meets up on the surface inside an old rebel bunker.\\n-Empire strikes back rip off.\\n-Fin is going to kill himself to save everyone and Rose stops him and I laughed. Then she says her speech\\, kisses him\\, and then does the worst faint I have ever seen in a high budget movie. ALL WHILE THEIR FRIENDS ARE DYING IN THE BACKGROUND. I laughed so hard that my stomach hurt.\\n-ATATs stopped shooting at Fin and Rose once they got close.\\n-No one fired a single shot at the Empire either\\n-Neither the soldiers nor the ATATs shot at Fin and Rose on the ground.\\n-FIN SOMEHOW DRAGS ROSE ALL THE WAY BACK ON FOOT WITHOUT ANYONE SHOOTING AT THEM.\\n-Luke shows up in ghost form and wastes time talking to Leia before actually going to help. If he wanted to talk with her\\, he could have just done it without projecting his whole being.\\n+Sweet moment where Kylo sees Luke and immediately says to shoot him.\\n-Kylo doesn't clue into the fact that Luke wasn't even there. He would have recognized the lightsaber.\\n+Luke does a sweet dodge and sliding move\\n-Kylo still doesn't notice the lack of footprints... on a planet that leaves red footprints on a white background.\\n-Kylo would have only need to try to read Luke's mind only to realize that there was noting there to read.\\n+Funny moment where Kylo and Hucks argue\\, Kylo throws Hucks into the wall\\, and the subordinate says \\\"Right away sir.\\\"\\n-Kylo yells \\\"Noooo\\\"\\n-Rebels escape because Rei is holding rocks and everyone just stands there like there's no sense of danger.\\n-The first order doesn't surround the mountain in case they try to escape.\\n-Luke dies anyways so it didn't even matter that he went there with no danger to himself.\\n-Leia is still alive but her actor is dead so Disney is screwed both ways.\\n+Poe says \\\"My name is Poe\\\" and Rei says \\\"my name is Rei\\\" and Poe says \\\"I know\\\" Nice callback to the classics.","true":true}
