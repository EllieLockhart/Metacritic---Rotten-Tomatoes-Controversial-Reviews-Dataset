Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"tldr: Made to sell merch on christmas... for me and my friends the death sentence for the starwars brand. Movie was beyond bad in storytelling. Disney managed to ruin starwars movies.","true":true}
