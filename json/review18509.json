Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is so depressing to watch Disney take my favorite franchise and turn it into this. This movie doesn't even have a plot that makes sense. 5 story lines go no where and have no impact on the movie. They destroy Luke Skywalk and are so desperate to make Rey a good character they destroy Kilo Ren in the process. At this point\\, I don't have any interest in watching another Star Wars movie. If the studio doesn't care enough to tell a story that makes sense\\, then why should I care?","true":true}
