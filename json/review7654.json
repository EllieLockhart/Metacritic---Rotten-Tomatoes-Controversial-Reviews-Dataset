Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everything was wrong. Luke Skywalker needed to train his apprentice\/padawan\/replacement . In doing so he needed to find redemption and hope {you know\\, the theme of the movie}. Ackbar needed to be the one to make the sacrifice to make room for his replacement. No hero's journey for the hero. Everything was wrong.","true":true}
