Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awesome movie. If you are giving it half stars or no stars then it's abundantly obvious you did not get the movie. It had some great twists and turns\\, and some like Rey's parents makes perfect sense if you get the theme of this film. Can't wait to see it over and over again.","true":true}
