Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi not only makes everything that happened in the original trilogy pointless\\, it also tosses out plot points set up in The Force Awakens. I don't know who didn't tell Rian Johnson that this movie was part of a trilogy but they messed up. From setting audience expectation and dashing it to timelines that don't sync up. This movie was fun to watch in Theatre but lost it's appeal as the honey moon phase wore off and you begin to realize just how poorly this movie was put together. \\n\\nAside from all that\\, and this has little to do with this movie\\, but the response Disney has had and allowed it's employees to have is disturbing. I will not be going to watch Episode 9 in theaters. If I here it's better than what I would believe it to be I'll make sure to rent it or borrow it from a friend to view.","true":true}
