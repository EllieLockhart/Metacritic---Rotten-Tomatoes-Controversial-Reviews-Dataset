Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Love it.  I thought it was one of the best Star Wars movies.  Of course\\, it doesn't beat Empire Strikes Back but its up there.  Lots of great moments that pay homage the past while giving you such great new characters to root for.  I definitely want to see it again.","true":true}
