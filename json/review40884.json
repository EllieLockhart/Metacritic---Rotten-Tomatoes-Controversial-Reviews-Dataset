Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie defies all expectations - not by exceeding them\\, but rather by tossing them into the trash compactor. The force is treated with little respect (I am aware it's a fantasy story) and the Skywalker bloodline is made irrelevant; anyone can be a Jedi with little to no training. By the way we are to now to ponder in a postmodern sense about whether the Jedi are ultimately a good thing. \\n\\nWe are treated to not-so-subtle lessons in how terrible men are at leading and accomplishment\\, while simultaneously drilled on how great women are at all things. The larger than life mastermind of the wannabe Empire is dispatched as if he were nonessential to the plot of the new trilogy. The same fate befalls the underused Boba Fe.... I mean Captain Phasma. Finn\\, who really needs a good story line\\, is now sent to an ultimately useless mission that spins as an on the nose \/ finger wagging moral lesson on war and greed. His pal is a new character created to ensure sales for the international market. BB8 isn't even developed beyond a couple of quick scenes\\, but Chewbacca does make a cameo near the beginning an end.\\n\\n It's as if the director wants to say to all of the fans\\, \\\"Star Wars is silly and forgettable\\, laugh at Luke drinking milk from the teat of a sea cow and shut up!\\\" It is an epic troll\\, a spit in the face of the spirit of the original trilogy.","true":true}
