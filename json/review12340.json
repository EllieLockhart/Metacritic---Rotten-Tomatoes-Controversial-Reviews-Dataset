Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am sure this movie ruined a lot of people's Christmas! It is a terribly written and directed movie. Some good effects but that is to be expected with a high budget film now days. It seems like they focused too much on the PC movement and not on the actual story telling aspect. All and all I am going to do my best to pretend that I didn't see the Last Jedi because it really does ruin the other great Star Wars movies. I would recommend this movie to an enemy.","true":true}
