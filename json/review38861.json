Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They just put away snoke in the garbage bin together with rey and ren past and luke's character. Every arc lacks a lot of information and let everyone confused. The film is really bad written\\, full of action and zero lore. This should not be considered a canon movie.","true":true}
