{"101487":133810,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never reviewed a film on RT\\, but I hate to see this movie get dragged into the mud over what I can only imagine is personal preference. Rian Johnson has done something for which a LOT of SW fans have been waiting: he took a hard left at viewers' expectations for how a new entry into the saga should look\\, and I don't think that counts as making a film \\\"bad\\\"\\, let alone ruining an entire saga. Without spoiling any of the surprises \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" beholds\\, I was excited\\, surprised\\, and often giddy as a school child throughout the duration of this movie. It's by no means perfect (very few films are\\, let alone SW movies)\\, but it takes risks in almost all of the right places. If you take a moment to consider the stories\\, the developments taking place within the characters (however small or large these may be)\\, and the balance between the film's levity and darkness (or shall I say\\, \\\"light and dark\\\"? :) )\\, I think it's evident that Rian Johnson isn't the bumbling moron people are making him out to be. Disliking the turn of events within a film is everybody's right\\, and if 45% of audiences TRULY disliked these\\, then so be it. Everyone has a right to their own opinion\\, but The Last Jedi\\\" is not the technically awful sacrilege many reviewers (and bots) are making it out to be.","true":true}
