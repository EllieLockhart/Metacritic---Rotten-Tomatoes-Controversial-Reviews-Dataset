First\\, the most beloved character (joel) from the previous installment is killed in a treacherous and pathetic way and the worst thing is that they expect you to love the murderer (Abi) despite her actions.\rHe feels forced what is political\\, always trying to spit it in your face\\, we have paid a game to have fun\\, not to educate us.\rThe level design is boring\\, repetitive and confusing\\, many times it happens that you do not know where to go because it is not well designed\\, you cannot explore as freely as promised and it is boring because of how poorly designed they are many times\\, besides that later it happens that places are repeated (How can a place where criminal trials are made compared to a restaurant?).\rThe story feels stuffy\\, it has no rhythm and when you think it is going to get interesting\\, cinematic from a flashback.\rThe enemies are pathetic\\, they do not show intelligence\\, their patterns are all the same and repetitive and it becomes boring because just pressing two buttons is enough to kill them.\rThe music is poorly implemented\\, it is not supposed to be because you must listen to the enemies (which are scarce) and the game becomes monotonous and boring.\rAnd the end....\rI give a zero for the lack of respect that the creators had to the original game\u2026 Expand","true":true}
