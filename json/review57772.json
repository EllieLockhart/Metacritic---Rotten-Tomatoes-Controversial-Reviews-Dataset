Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very unfortunate to see my favorite franchise go so low. Rian Johnson was trying to do something edgy and different with Star Wars but he went too far. He ignored characters motivations and well as the lore and mythos of the saga. The humor didn't work\\, and subplots that added nothing to the story.","true":true}
