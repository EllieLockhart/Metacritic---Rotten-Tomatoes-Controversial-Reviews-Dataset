Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think this is the best of the new Star Wars films\\, the film went a lot farther than I ever thought they would go in terms of story. The Porgs are terrible and some of the shots don't really look like Star Wars some how but aside from the things shoe horned in\\, the core of the film is very enjoyable.","true":true}
