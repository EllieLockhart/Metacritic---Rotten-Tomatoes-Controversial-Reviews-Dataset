Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not 'painful to watch' like the prequels (on account of their terrible acting)\\, but a lot of missed opportunities and uneven pacing. Rian Johnson is so determined to subvert expectations that you end up with two-and-a-half hours of fake-outs: everything from the title of the film to a B-story that ultimately goes nowhere. It's watchable\\, and has a few high points\\, but even the Saga's most ardent fans will probably fast-forward through the 20-minute casino scene on repeat viewings.","true":true}
