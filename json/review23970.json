Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Man\\, what a freaking disappointment on so many levels.  The character of Luke Skywalker was a freaking wus.  In the origionals he was the guy that could not be convined that his father was a lost cause\\, and he proved everybody was wrong.  Seeking out the good in an almost black hole of a man.  In this one\\, he nearly kills his nephew because he feels a sliver of darkness in him.  Come on man!!!  And then the whole space chase details of the story. :thumbsDown.","true":true}
