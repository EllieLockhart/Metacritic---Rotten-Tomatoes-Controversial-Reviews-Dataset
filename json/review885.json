Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An incredible film that evolves the saga past the tropes that have held it back. If you are incapable of\\, as the film says\\, letting the past die\\, then this film is not for you. Ive been an enormous Star Wars fan all my life and I truly loved the new directions taken in this film. Anyone saying that it\u2019s destroying the legacy of what came before clearly has a massive misunderstanding of the franchise as a whole. I firmly believe that this movie will be considered among the series\u2019 best in the years to come\\, once everyone has a chance to calm down and we\u2019re able to examine its place in the story.
