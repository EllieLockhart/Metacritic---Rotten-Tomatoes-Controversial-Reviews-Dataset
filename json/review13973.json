Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you go expecting this to be different from other Star Wars movies\\, you will end up enjoying it!  The plot is good & and you see Rey\\, Finn\\, Poe & even Luke Skywalker learn life lessons & grow as a result.  I think this movie ends Luke's story & sets us up to focus on Re'ss\\, Finn's\\, Poe's & Kylo Ren's story in the next installment.  You'll get to see Leia use the force in a life-saving way\\, and some terrific fight & battle scenes\\, as well as some humor.  Go into with an open mind-I think you'll end up liking it!","true":true}
