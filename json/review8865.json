Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For Star Wars franchise\\,this is a terrible movie\\, even comparing to the prequels which at least had better heart to them. This is so full of plot-holes\\, weak characters\\, and character assassinations (of Luke) too. Just too full of the political correctness driving it. The stupid Holdo (purple-haired lady)\\, with Poe and Finn get almost everybody killed by their non-cooperativeness. And Rey is such a Mary-Sue\\, we might have to declare a new league of Mary Sue for her alone. I absolutely regret seeing this movie.","true":true}
