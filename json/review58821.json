Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This is a true masterpiece.\rTo call it a game is to underestimate the whole endeavor - this is an experience\\, a piece of art and an emotional rollercoaster that left me heartbroken for days after the ending (and thats a good thing).\rDruckman had a vision and he wanted to share it without compromises and hesitation and I'm so glad Sony let him do it. He wanted to show how a dark world helped to create a dark side in characters. it wasn't supposed to be a happy story for Joel and Ellie. It wasn't supposed to be a streamlined continuation of the first game. It was supposed to be real and messy. And it was. Very real and very\\, very messy.\rThis ride is so much more than a typical revenge story. Not many revenge tales succeed in diving deep inside the protagonist psyche and show how awful the loss of control and judgement can be.\r\rThe addition of Abby. I didn't like it. At first. I'm glad they did it. Second only to the realness of Ellie's descent toward madness\\, a glimpse on the life on motivation of the \\\"antagonist\\\" (just another person trying to survive in crazy world) made the whole thing even harder to accept and process.\r\rThis is not a game for people looking for a wholesome\\, happy story of people living together and overcoming hardness. This is not a game for people who can not accept that bad sh*t can and sometimes will happen (in life and on screen). This is a game for people who want to dive inside a dark and gritty vision of a master storyteller. For people who understand that art can't be artistic without flaws and good plot can't and won't appeal to everyone.\r\rA true masterpiece.\r\r*gameplay is awesome\\, soundtrack is magical and immersive\\, side characters are believable (if not very interesting)\\, the attention to details is insane\\, atmosphere is haunting at all times and the ending...\rSee for yourself.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
