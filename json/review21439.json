Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I won't Rabble about the movie...a lot of other people did this and yeha...Just a quick overview of MY opinion to this...Disasterpiece\\n\\n+ great visuals\\n+ star wars sounds and sountrack\\n+ dark\\n+ ONE cool new force mechanics\\n+ Adam Driver\\n\\n- Story-Potholes all over the Place\\n- very bad writing\\n- Bad Main and Sidestories\\n- Destroyed\/dropt the good and promising Introductions of Ep.
