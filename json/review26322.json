Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not the Star Wars we wanted but the one we needed.  How to you allow a beloved franchise to continue without being a repeat of the same over and over?  You have to kill the old and create new.  Rian did exactly this in a beautiful way.","true":true}
