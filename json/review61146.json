The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"First off\\, I would give this a solid 9 or a 10 but the story pacing was off.\r\rAbby is a good character and honestly I don't get why people would criticize the game for how Joel died. He gave up his name because 1) he got a little soft during the years in safety\\, 2) Tommy already said their names to Abby and used his real name to introduce himself to the group\\, and 3) it's his gosh dang first name\\, how was he to expect he would be killed for revealing that his name was Joel (which a million other people are named\\, I'm sure).\rI loved the game! Both of the Abby\/Ellie fights were great and very hard to get through because I just wanted them to stop. It's something that I think is super awesome they managed to do with a video game.\rI lowkey thought Abby's section was better than Ellie's (just a bit). I can understand why people don't like that it isn't much related to Ellie's half. But I think it is related to the theme\\, the game is making you play instead of telling you what to think or feel about a character. You're taken on a ride with Abby and Lev that reminded me of the Joel and Ellie dynamic but in a unique and interesting way. As soon as Abby makes the choice to betray her people for the ones she cares about and gain her humanity back\\, we are asked to undergo a similar change. We are forced to ask ourselves\\, \\\"Am I willing to forgive her?\\\". If the answer is yes\\, then it becomes all the more painful to see the death and destruction Ellie caused from Abby's point of view. Just as soon as she was redeemed\\, Abby had to lose all over again. And when these two collide\\, they know nothing about each other and we know everything\\, we understand both sides. This is what made the fighting\\, from then on\\, so frustrating and so engaging.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
