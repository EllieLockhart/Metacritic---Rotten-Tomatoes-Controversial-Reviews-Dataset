Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From start to finish this movie is fun\\, funny\\, entertaining and emotionally relevant. Some of the action sequences are stunningly original\\, and there are scenes which will undoubtedly go down as among the most classic and quintessential to series lore. Well acted\\, and suprisingly so by Hamil in particular. Also\\, new characters are introduced so well\\, they enrich the story and leave you wanting to know what's next.","true":true}
