Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a good movie\\, just a cheap way to farm money from the fans. I could point all the reasons why i didnt liked this movie for sure\\, but i think many here already pointed pretty much every bad or cringe moment this movie had that i dont think i have anything to add up\\, all i can say is: Visually its a beautiful movie\\, but its also a empty shell of what SW stands for and meant for all these old-school fans","true":true}
