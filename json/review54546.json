Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm an avid Star Wars fan who thoroughly enjoyed Star Wars:  The Force Awakens and especially Rogue One.  I was so excited about Star Wars:  The Last Jedi that I carefully avoided all spoilers and didn't even watch the trailers\\, so everything would be a complete surprise.\\nStar Wars:  The Last Jedi was\\, indeed\\, a complete surprise.\\nIt is without a doubt the worst movie in the entire Star Wars franchise.\\nIts sins are many:  the pacing is really slow and clumsy\\, the humor feels awkward and forced in spots\\, and most importantly one of the major subplots goes absolutely nowhere.  Yeah\\, that's right:  One of the major characters gets the Indiana Jones treatment from Indiana Jones and the Kindgom of the Crystal Skull.  He might have well stayed at home in bed\\, because he very literally manages to accomplish nothing of any meaning throughout the entire long movie.\\nThe worst part of all\\, though\\, is it feels like director Rian Johnson didn't like some of the things that J.J. Abrams did with the original movie - so suddenly things are changed retroactively\\, characters act in manners completely contradictory to the way that they did in Star Wars:  The Force Awakens\\, etc.\\nOverall\\, this movie has some good points (superb orchestral score\\, incredible special effects\\, beautiful set dressings\\, fantastic costumes\\, and generally great acting) but the plot itself is a complete trainwreck.","true":true}
