Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I generally enjoyed this movie\\, while it has it's problems the good definitely outweighs the bad here. It's just an enjoyable film for a star wars fan","true":true}
