Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow! That was amazing! I loved it\\, and I enjoyed it a lot. There were also some scenes I did not expect\\, and that's what makes it so great. I think this Star Wars movie is now my new favorite. ","true":true}
