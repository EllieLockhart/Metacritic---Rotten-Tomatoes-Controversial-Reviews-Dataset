Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie ruined pretty much all the good will of many Star Wars fans.  Absolute trash story overshadows the decent cinematography\\, and John William's score.  More than likely it ruined the entire Disney trilogy and it seriously hurt the franchise as a whole.","true":true}
