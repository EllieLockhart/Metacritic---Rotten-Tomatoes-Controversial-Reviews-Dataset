Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So so fantasy\/Sci Fi film.  Not so bad as stand alone film\\, rubbish as Star Wars story. Massive plot holes\\, characters not acting consistently from earlier films\\, unnecessary SJW politics. Attempted humour unfunny and out of place. Poor plot\\, no continuation from eth Force Awakens (had the dircetor even watched the film?). Only good thing was visuals and music\\, however those alone do not make a film. I have no interest in characters and have no intention to pay to see anymore sequels. Avoid.","true":true}
