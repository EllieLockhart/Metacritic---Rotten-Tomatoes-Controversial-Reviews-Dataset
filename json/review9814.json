Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great action but bad plot. Whats the deal with Luke Skywalker? Very child like attitude. The plot was a mess. There are questions not answerd from Ep VII. Who was Snoke? Is this gonna be addressed in Ep IX? What about the jokes. Very unfunny and forced\\, at least to me. The casino planet was boring and the subplot with Finn and Rose felt pointless. Hope that on Ep IX the plot holes are revealed.","true":true}
