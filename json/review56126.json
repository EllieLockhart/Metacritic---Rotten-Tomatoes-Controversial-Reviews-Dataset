Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILER ALERT: I created a Rotten Tomatoes account just to rate this movie. The entire plot felt rushed. There is little to no character depth in this entire new trilogy. Snoke's death was completely meaningless. In fact\\, the entire characyer added nothing to the development of Kylo. Luke's death felt empty. Why is there slow-motion used in the lightsaber fight scene? Why have the usual hologram calls between planets that show full-bodied 3D representations of the individual suddenly become close up images or odd bubbles? How is Kylo\\, a young Sith apprentice with little training\\, able to slay a Sith Lord and survive for even 2 seconds against Luke Skywalker\\, one of the most powerful Jedi ever born into existence? Why does Yoda suddenly appear to physically come back to life and start blowing up old Jedi texts (not just make his usual force appearance to provide counsel)? This whole thing is a cash cow for Disney. They don't care at all about the development of the Star Wars Universe. Episode VIII shows that Star Wars needs George Lucas.","true":true}
