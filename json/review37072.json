Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The new Star Wars episode is unique. It has great sense of humor. The movie have everything what a movie need. Humor\\, action\\, legends\\, next level of Jedi and Sith clash. If its a new beginning of the franchise\\, i will be very glad. Wonderful\\, amazing fight scenes. Good job Johnson!","true":true}
