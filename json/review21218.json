Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I watched the original SW episode IV 2 hours before watching The Last Jedi.  The difference in quality versus quantity between the two was so shocking I left the theater in a disturbed and almost numb mental state.  What a sad waste of plot lines\\, characters and potential. There were so many pointless subplots and drawn out sequences I was literally bored\\, annoyed and confused multiple times. So many nonsensical and disconnecting elements I literally lost count.  How is it even possible that the critic and fan reviews are so lopsided in the opposite direction of a franchise so universally beloved by fanboys? Because it embodies so little of what makes Star Wars great.  The story is pathetic and apathetic at the same time. What a complete waste.  Shamefully uninspiring.","true":true}
