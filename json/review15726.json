Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie I will try to see it a few more times before it comes out on DVD it has great witty humor and some great dramatic moments and had lots of action. It was not predictable at all great twists. I am a long time Star Wars fan and I loved it. Extremely well done story and great character moments.","true":true}
