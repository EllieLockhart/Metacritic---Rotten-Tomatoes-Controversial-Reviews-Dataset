Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie basically destroys everything the franchise made 40 years to build. Kylo Ren keeps saying \\\"let the past die\\\" since episode 7 and that's basically what the evil maniac mouse is doing with Star Wars. It's an insult to everything related to the force\\, to the jedi order\\, to the skywalker family name\\, to villains in general\\, to space battles.\\n\\nIt's basically a bad avenger movie with a pun or a joke every 2 minutes\\, set in the star wars universe. This movie is the equivalent of the terrible\\, terrible\\, aftermath books series.\\n\\nWe can only say that Rian Johnson Wendiged the disney trilogy and the whole canon movies by releasing this awful movie.\\n\\nAlso\\, seeing such high praise from critics really mean that none of them ever adhered or understood the star wars universe\\, don't know anything about pantheism and that\\, overall\\, we are going straight forward towards idiocracy.","true":true}
