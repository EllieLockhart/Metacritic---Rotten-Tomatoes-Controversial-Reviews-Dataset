Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"HOW DID THIS GET MADE?!?!?!\\n\\nAfter watching this\\, I nearly threw up. It felt like the visual equivalent of licking brown stuff stuck to the bowl of a public toilet! \\n\\nI can't believe what at total incompetent hack Rian Johnson is! \\nI KNEW he'd fail because I remember thinking how awful and overrated Looper was.
