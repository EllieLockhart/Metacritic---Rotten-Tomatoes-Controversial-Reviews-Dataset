Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm still up in the air about this one. I'd consider myself a big fan of the franchise\\, as I was 5 when the original\\, \\\"A New Hope\\\" was released in 1977. That was an age that made Space Smuggler\\, Jedi Knight\\, Stormtrooper\\, and X-Wing Pilot\\, a possible career path...haha. My oldest son was 5 when The Phantom Menace was released\\, and as I saw history repeating itself\\, I even gave the prequels some positive praise. The Force Awakens was a great addition in my opinion\\, even though the story was pretty much in line with A New Hope. I didn't see the comparison to The Last Jedi and Empire Strikes Back\\, as some are suggesting. What really threw me about this movie was the excess use of comedy. I felt like it was trying to compete with a Marvel movie\\, when it should be completely the opposite. I mean of course there was drama\\, but the impact of losing a character that was just introduced doesn't amount to much. Also\\, some of the Jedi \\\"powers\\\" that are all of a sudden possible (like being able to survive the vacuum of space) where they were never seen in any previous movie\\, kind of made it seem like they were a little too immortal\\, and kind of broke the integrity of the movies before it. However\\, without a doubt\\, it was entertaining\\, and worth seeing. Hopefully you'll be able to look past my opinionated faults and still be able to enjoy it.","true":true}
