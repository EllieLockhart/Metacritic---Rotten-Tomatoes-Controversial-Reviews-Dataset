Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst movie I have ever seen\\, all I could do not to walk out. I like Star Wars\\, but this was just an all out bad movie. It stinks of big money trying to cash in on Star Wars fans in the worst way. Sad day for SW fans\\, Save your friends and families and warn them about this horrible movie. Worst movie ever!","true":true}
