Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bloated\/Boring and slow.  Alll the hype and questions from Force Awakens were just irrrelevant with this movie.  Plot holes and nothing for star wars fans to be pleased with.  I fell a sleep twice during the movie.","true":true}
