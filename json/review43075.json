Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie will be used in cinema schools as an example of what NOT to do with a movie which is a part of a saga. You simply can't ignore the previous behavior and features of the characters and just build your own personal version of them. You can't ignore the laws of the universe in which they live. You can't ignore the pace and tone of the previous installments.\\nIt will also be used as an example of what happens when an amateur director (like Rian Johnson certainly is\\, given his 2-only-movies resum\u00e8) is given complete control over the production. \\nFinally it will be used as an example of what NOT to do after the movie is out and gets completely thrashed by the audience. You can't tell 53% of the audience that they are stupid for not liking your movie.\\nYou are the stupid\\, Rian.","true":true}
